Vladimir Kara-Murza, a journalist and politician, knew as soon as he heard the opening chord that he had only five minutes to get up before prison guards would take away his pillow and mattress. By 5.20am his metal bed frame, attached to the wall, would be locked up so that he could not use it for the rest of the day. Kara-Murza’s cell, painted in bright blue, was five metres long and two metres wide. In the middle, a table and a bench were screwed to the floor. The only objects he was allowed to keep were a mug, a tooth brush, a towel and a pair of slippers. The light was never turned off.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Later in the morning a mug of tea and a bowl of gluey porridge made from an unidentifiable grain would be pushed through a small hatch in the cell door. At some point Kara-Murza would be permitted a 90-minute “walk” – a stroll around a concrete courtyard the same size as his cell with a metal grille in place of a roof. He was obliged to keep his hands behind his back. Often the sub-zero temperatures made it impossible to keep going for the allotted time. The loudspeaker in his cell blared throughout the day, sometimes playing the local radio station, sometimes a monotonous recital of the penal-colony rules.</p><style data-emotion="css 8na79c">.css-8na79c{line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);font-weight:700;padding-left:2rem;padding-right:3rem;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);line-height:var(--1843-type-leading-upper);font-family:var(--1843-type-system-slab-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-5);padding-left:0;padding-right:0;}.css-8na79c del,.css-8na79c s{-webkit-text-decoration:strikethrough;text-decoration:strikethrough;}.css-8na79c strong,.css-8na79c b{font-weight:700;}.css-8na79c em,.css-8na79c i{font-style:italic;}.css-8na79c sup{font-feature-settings:'sups' 1;bottom:0.5rem;font-size:smaller;position:relative;vertical-align:baseline;}.css-8na79c sub{font-feature-settings:'subs' 1;font-size:smaller;position:relative;top:0.25rem;vertical-align:baseline;}.css-8na79c small,.css-8na79c .small-caps{display:inline;font-size:inherit;font-variant:small-caps no-common-ligatures no-discretionary-ligatures no-historical-ligatures no-contextual lining-nums;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;}.css-8na79c u,.css-8na79c .underline{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-8na79c a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;}.css-8na79c a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-thickness:0.0625rem;}.css-8na79c a:focus{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);outline:none;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-45);text-decoration-thickness:0.125rem;}.css-8na79c a:active{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;}.css-8na79c em,.css-8na79c i{font-style:normal;}</style><aside class="css-8na79c e1gvmbw00">Like Navalny, Kara-Murza was the victim of suspected Novichok poisoning.

(It is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who uncovered a $230m fraud and who died in prison in 2009, having been denied urgent medical treatment.)

This measure had been taken, officials said, because of a “severe administrative breach” by Kara-Murza: missing a wake-up call which he says never came.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Kara-Murza is permitted to write and receive letters, though he is only allowed a pen for 90 minutes each day.

He spent 11 years within the gulag and wrote a three-volume “literary investigation” in which he mapped it as though it were “an almost invisible, almost imperceptible country…though scattered in an archipelago geographically”. He described the prisoners, starving and exhausted by work, “eyes oozing with tears, red eyelids. White cracked lips covered with sores. Skewbald, unshaven bristles on the faces.”</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Part of the function of the gulag, Solzhenitysn argued, was economic: Stalin needed labour to industrialise and prepare for war in Europe. The camps were usually in far-flung places rich in natural resources that needed extracting. But their horrors also served a political purpose: to sow terror and purge from society anyone who showed signs of independent thought. It was “a wonderful place into which he could herd millions as a form of intimidation”, wrote Solzhenitsyn.</p><aside class="css-8na79c e1gvmbw00">Many of Russia’s camps – particularly in more remote parts of the country – are staffed by children and grandchildren of those who guarded the gulag</aside><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">After Stalin’s death in 1953 the extermination stopped, the system became more humane and the number of prisoners decreased, but its essence remained. Navalny saw many of the features of the gulag perpetuated in the Russians prison system. “It is not concerned in the slightest with the re-education of prisoners but is aimed only at dehumanising the prisoner, bullying him and serving the illegal orders of the country’s political leadership,” he wrote. “This system cannot be reformed.” As Solzhenitsyn observed: “Archipelago was, Archipelago is, Archipelago will be.” The archipelago has shrunk in size, changed its name and adapted to new economic conditions – but its terrain and procedures remain recognisable.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Few institutions in Russia have experienced the continuity that prisons have. Both prisoners of the Soviet gulag and those who guarded them have passed on their experiences to their descendants. Russia’s camps – particularly in more remote parts of the country where the prison is the main employer – are often staffed by children and grandchildren of those who guarded the gulag. These dynasties see their past as a point of pride. When the Usolsky penal camp in Siberia celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2013, its press office hailed the unbroken tradition of “loyalty to the Motherland, mutual support and respect for veterans” stretching back to its founding just before the second world war.</p><div class="css-0 e18kpe850"><figure class="css-sscfcz e1197rjj0"><img loading="lazy" width="709" height="1063" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_10.jpg"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2"><span class="css-eb0fyw e6ii4pq0">Police detained dozens of people at an unsanctioned rally against political repression in March 2020</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Russia’s current prison population remains among the highest per head in Europe with Belarus and Turkey but, at around 430,000, it is the lowest in its history. Around 225,000 employees work in the system. The network of colonies and detention centres is still so vast that prisoners often disappear within it for weeks; they are transferred from one facility to another in windowless train compartments with six berths and twice as many prisoners. Their families and lawyers lose track of them.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">New arrivals to prison are placed in “quarantine”, where they are given medical checks and a psychological assessment, before they are moved to a shared cell or solitary confinement. But the main purpose of this is to break the spirit of the prisoner. Scared and often barred from seeing a lawyer, they feel completely powerless. Kafkaesque absurdity is built into the system, explains Anna Karetnikova, now in exile, who once oversaw pre-trial detention centres in the Moscow region. To demand a meeting with a lawyer, detainees need a pen and paper, which they are often denied. (They can complain, of course, but for that they still need a pen and paper.)</p><aside class="css-8na79c e1gvmbw00">To demand a meeting with a lawyer, detainees need a pen and paper, which is often denied.

In countries governed by the rule of law, punishment comes after a trial. In Russia investigations start after an arrest and continue inside prisons and penal colonies. <i>Operativniki</i>, who are rewarded on the basis of how many crimes they solve, use their unlimited power to coerce confessions and pin new crimes on prisoners. They work in close co-ordination with the security services and the police, deciding who gets urgent medical care and who gets punished with solitary confinement or beaten in special “pressure cells”.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB css-0 e1cbnkh80"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Conditions vary greatly between colonies and even between cells within the same prison. Some have televisions and fridges; others have only a hole in the floor for a toilet. Some prisoners can pay for the use of a gym or have food brought to them by a delivery company. Others are kept hungry. Many prisons, including <small>IK-7</small> in Omsk, are connected to an electronic mail system, so sending a letter to a prisoner can take a matter of minutes. But the speed at which it is passed on depends on the good will of the prison censor. A benevolent censor will deliver the correspondence within hours. A cruel one may not deliver it at all.

This offers a business opportunity for prison bosses. Corruption lies at the heart of the gulag’s modern iteration, explains a former senior prisoner official. Bribery can buy you a better cell and racketeering by prison staff is endemic. They rent out slave labour to friendly businesses.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">How much a prisoner must pay is decided by the <i>khoziain</i> – the master who runs the prison. Details of the amounts that change hands are scarce but, in 2012, monthly “collections” at one prison with 1,500 inmates ran at between $1m and $1.5m. Some people paid the equivalent of $60 a month; others $25,000. The money is shared with other prison officials.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Those who refuse to pay get “broken” – beaten or tortured. The richer they are and the more they resist, the greater the punishment. “Breaking” is mostly carried out not by guards but by “activists” – inmates who work closely with the prison administration. The methods of torture include denying medical care, beatings, suspending prisoners from bars (known as “crucifying”), electric shocks and rape with mop handles. Russian prisons have the highest number of deaths and suicides in Europe and the rate is growing according to the latest figures. Political prisoners are rarely tortured physically but there is no shortage of means by which suffering can be inflicted. Navalny was worn down with sleep deprivation, tormented with the smell of food when he was on hunger strike and denied treatment.</p><aside class="css-8na79c e1gvmbw00">Corruption lies at the heart of the gulag’s modern iteration, explains a former senior prisoner official</aside><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Relations between prisoners across the system are regulated by a strict, unwritten “thieves’ law” which has evolved over decades and passed down by word of mouth. It has its own argot – prison is called “our common home” – and conflicts are resolved by a council appointed by a “crowned” thief-in-law who oversees the <i>obschak</i>, the common slush fund.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Prisoners are divided into four castes. The top caste is “criminal elite” or “made men”, who perform no duties themselves and adjudicate conflicts. They are followed by “collaborators”, “bitches” or “reds” who enforce order alongside prison officers. “Lads”, “men” or “wool”, who are not professional criminals, make up the vast majority of prisoners. And then there are the outcasts or untouchables who are referred to as “cocks” or “the degraded” because they sleep under the bunk beds. They are not allowed to touch other prisoners or their possessions, and must eat separately, using their own cutlery. People convicted of sex crimes, snitches and people who hide the fact they’re gay fall into this category. This stigma follows outcasts from one prison to the next.</p><div class="css-0 e18kpe850"><figure class="css-sscfcz e1197rjj0"><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="1214" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_07_RT.jpg"/></figure></div><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">This informal hierarchy has been endorsed by prison authorities.

After visiting Kotov there, Eismont was struck by how poorly defended it seemed from the outside: there were no towers or barbed wire. “It was guarded by fear,” she wrote. “You feel that fear in the looks of those convicts who walk around the camp without a convoy, but answer monosyllabically to your questions and avoid eye contact,” she has written. “You feel it in the visitors’ waiting room filled with relatives of the convicts, who try their best not to talk to you. ‘They don’t like lawyers here,’ one explained.”</p><div class="css-0 e18kpe850"><figure class="css-sscfcz e1197rjj0"><img loading="lazy" width="1080" height="721" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_05.jpg"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2"><span class="css-eb0fyw e6ii4pq0">Konstantin Kotov, a human-rights activist, received hundreds of letters when he spent over a year in prison for violating Russian protest rules in 2019</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Eventually she was allowed to see her defendant. “Kotov had been there less than a day, but I saw a completely different person.” It was not primarily that his head had been shaved or that he was dressed in an oversized uniform – he simply wouldn’t look her in the eye.

The camps destroyed the fabric of life and liquidated entire social classes. There was no discernable logic determining who was sent there or and nothing you could do would spare you. As with many Russians, the history of the gulag feels personal to Kara-Murza: his grandfather was arrested in 1937 and survived a labour camp in the far east.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">After Stalin’s death, the Soviet leadership lost the appetite for mass repression. Slave labour was ineffective and even the leadership had had enough of terror. The <small>KGB</small>, which Putin joined in the 1970s, found that the memory of mass repression was enough to control the populace. Everyone knew somebody whose relatives had been sent to the gulag. This was enough to instil compliance. The number of political prisoners fell to between 10,000 and 20,000, according to one of the Soviet dissidents.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Kara-Murza was eight years old in 1989, when “The Gulag Archipelago” was published in Russia. It was an important literary event but it remained largely unread. Two years later the Soviet Union collapsed and even fewer people cared about Soviet dissidents in the brave new world of capitalism.</p><div class="css-0 e18kpe850"><figure class="css-sscfcz e1197rjj0"><img loading="lazy" width="1134" height="756" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240221_1843_GULAG_09.jpg"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2"><span class="css-eb0fyw e6ii4pq0">Vladimir Bukovsky, a freed dissident, holds up his passport to the press after arriving at Heathrow Airport, London, in 1977</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">But Kara-Murza retained his interest. In 2005 he made a four-part documentary about dissidents. Even then, he was in no doubt that Russia was heading back into authoritarianism. His subjects included his hero Vladimir Bukovsky, the Soviet dissident and memoirist.<b> </b>Bukovsky, who was imprisoned during the 1970s, wrote about trying to maintain his sanity in prison by drawing a castle – sometimes on scraps of paper, sometimes on the floor – with a fragment of a pencil lead he kept hidden in his cheek.

He introduced a law requiring any “politically active” organisation or person, in receipt of funds from outside Russia, to register as a “foreign agent”; and he expanded the scope of treason legislation to encompass not just espionage but “providing financial, material-technical, advisory or other assistance to a foreign state, international or foreign organisation…in activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation”. The vagueness of the word “other” allowed the state, as the Soviets had done before, to pursue people for any activities it disapproved of.

In 2013 there were just four convictions on charges of treason. But Putin didn’t need a conveyor belt of trials to achieve his goals – his intention was to reignite collective fear because exemplary brutality and lengthy sentences intimidate the whole of society. By 2021 more than half of the population were concerned about the return of repression.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Putin started the war against Ukraine to solidify his power and shape Russia in his image. The extraordinary circumstances allowed him to boost his arsenal of repressive measures in order to stamp out any opposition. The offences introduced at the beginning of the war – “spreading false information” and “discrediting the Russian army” – were taken straight from the Soviet criminal code. He has also brought back Soviet practices, such as declaring dissidents “insane” and locking them up in psychiatric hospitals. Last year an 18-year-old activist, Maksim Lypkyan, was forcibly detained in a mental institution after being convicted of spreading “fake news”.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">The justice system has become a tool of repression – few people get out of prison after being arrested. Pre-trial detentions can last for years and the acquittal rate in Russia is less than 0.5%. Sometimes, punishment is dispensed without a trial. If people who are designated “foreign agents” repeatedly fail to declare their status when they broadcast, publish or post on social media, they are automatically considered criminals.</p><aside class="css-8na79c e1gvmbw00">Pre-trial detentions can last for years and the acquittal rate in Russia is less than 0.5%</aside><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">In 2023 more than 100 people were charged with treason, among them Kara-Murza. In court he noted that in “its secrecy and its contempt for legal norms”, his trial was less fair than those of Soviet dissidents in the 1960s and 1970s. He felt as if he had been taken back to the show trials of the great terror in the 1930s.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">For the most part, Putin’s terror has worked. After 15,000 arrests in the first month after the invasion, protests have died down. Around 1,100 people are serving sentences for their beliefs. The number of people who have been charged under politically repressive laws in Russia over the past six years is greater than at any time since 1956, according to Proekt, a Russian online media outlet. Mass arrests can be dangerous for authoritarian regimes, because they puncture the myth of popular support. But numbers don’t tell the whole story. “Until recently it was the well educated, a socially and politically active minority, who were aware of political prosecutions. Now everybody, from a taxi driver to a shop assistant, knows that people can go to prison for what they say,” says Eismont, who has defended prisoners of conscience, including Kara-Murza.</p><div class="css-0 e18kpe850"><figure class="css-sscfcz e1197rjj0"><img loading="lazy" width="992" height="661" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcSet="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/1843_20240222_1843_GULAG_13A.jpg"/><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e6ii4pq2"><span class="css-eb0fyw e6ii4pq0">Valeria Zotova is currently serving a six-year prison sentence for supporting Alexei Navalny and participating in pro-Ukraine groups online</span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Some of the recent crop of political prisoners are famous, such as Yashin, the charismatic Russian politician.

Much of the book is set in a penal colony in Siberia in homage to Dostoyevsky. Tolstoy, much to his regret, never went to prison. Neither did Anton Chekhov. But both recognised that you cannot be a writer of national importance without incorporating the institution into your literary world. For those who aspire to be national politicians in Russia, prison is not just a punishment or hindrance but the ultimate test of someone’s convictions. It asserts their dignity and earns them moral authority.</p><aside class="css-8na79c e1gvmbw00">Prison is ingrained in Russian song, language and folklore. “If you have not been to prison, you don’t know life,” goes one proverb</aside><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">Navalny, the ultimate national politician, understood this fully. He walked into prison to strike at the fear that prison instils and, in so doing, liberate his people from paralysis. When Putin tortured Navalny, he didn’t want a confession but a plea for mercy, an admission that fear works. He could not obtain it.</p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t e1tt35bk0">In his last significant appeal to Russia’s supreme court made from his penal colony,  Navalny pleaded not for justice for his country or for his own release, but for the right of prisoners to have two items of printed material in a punishment cell. The rules permitted just one. For himself he requested two books – the Bible and “The Law of God”, a volume of Orthodox teachings. But he wasn’t just concerned with his own situation. A Muslim prisoner, he argued, is faced with a choice of having the Quran or a newspaper. Such a prisoner would always choose the former, but anyone put in a punishment cell also needs a newspaper because “it is a very cold place.” he said: “Do you know what they take newspapers into the cell for? To cover themselves at night.” In Russia the separation between prison and freedom, life and death, is newspaper thin. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph" class="css-qvl92t
