By Jonathan Eig. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 688 pages; $35. Simon & Schuster; \u00a325\nSIX MONTHS after Florida\u2019s board of education banned \u201ccritical race theory\u201d (CRT)\u2014in essence, the study of structural racism\u2014from its classrooms, Ron DeSantis, the governor, introduced legislation further restricting what his state\u2019s teachers could say about race. He invoked an unlikely ally: \u201cYou think about what MLK stood for,\u201d he told a crowd last year. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want people judged on the colour of their skin, but on the content of their character.\u201d Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House of Representatives, invoked King too: CRT, he said, \u201cgoes against everything Martin Luther King junior taught us\u2014not to judge others by the colour of their skin.\u201d\nThe phrase \u201ccontent of their character\u201d, which King used in his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, delivered at the March on Washington of 1963, has become one of his best known. Out of context, it seems to advocate colour-blindness towards individuals above all else, even to suggest that policies which take account of racial inequities are themselves unfairly biased. That is a misunderstanding of King\u2019s views\u2014and it is far from the only one in wide circulation. The reverence with which Americans of all political stripes view him today obscures how deeply divisive he was in his time. \nKing was a thorny, prophetic, demanding thinker. He struggled to balance his optimistic patriotism against self-doubt and, later in his life, against his creeping pessimism about America\u2019s ability to overcome its demons. Jonathan Eig\u2019s magnificent new biography is an overdue attempt to grapple with King in all his complexity.\nHis book will inevitably draw comparisons with \u201cAmerica in the King Years\u201d, a three-volume history by Taylor Branch. But that trilogy was sprawling and expansive\u2014almost 3,000 pages long, and as much about America between 1954 and 1968 as about King. Mr Eig\u2019s is a more traditional biography, and the book benefits from its narrower focus. It gives the reader more insight into the multifaceted man himself.\nFor though King was a great man, he was not a saint. He plagiarised, philandered, was unkind and sometimes cruel to his wife, and seems to have suffered from what is now recognised as depression. He was also funny, fond of good food and politically shrewd. A doting father, he had a gift for friendship and extraordinary reserves of patience and discipline. Mr Eig makes his courage and moral vision seem all the more exceptional for having come from a man with ordinary flaws.\nKing was the product of a middle-class upbringing, and of a family ensconced in Atlanta\u2019s black bourgeoisie. His father, affectionately known as \u201cDaddy King\u201d, was strong-willed and stern; he preached at Ebenezer Baptist Church, making it one of the city\u2019s more prominent black churches. King attended Morehouse College, then as now one of America\u2019s best historically black universities, before moving on to seminary in Pennsylvania and graduate school in theology at Boston University.\nNow remembered for his oratory, as a young seminarian, Mr Eig notes, \u201che earned As in his philosophy classes and Cs in public speaking.\u201d Mr Eig speculates that some of his northern, white professors \u201cwere not enthralled with the black Baptist style\u201d. The high marks in philosophy, however, are unsurprising: King was a student of ideas for his entire life. Written in 1963, his \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d is renowned for its moral force and lucid prose. It also bristles with allusions\u2014to the Old and New Testaments, but also Thomas Aquinas, Reinhold Neibuhr, Martin Buber and others. (It did not mention Mohandas Gandhi, whose philosophy of non-violent resistance was perhaps the single greatest influence on King\u2019s life and work.)\nHe found his voice as a political leader on December 5th 1955, when he was just 26 and a newly installed pastor in Montgomery, Alabama. At Holt Street Baptist Church that evening, four days after the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger, he addressed a crowd of black Alabamans. They were concerned about the response that their boycott of Montgomery\u2019s buses might provoke from the city\u2019s whites.\nMr Eig explains that King \u201cneeded to embolden without embittering\u201d. He had to acknowledge his audience\u2019s justified anger yet persuade them to protest righteously and hopefully. Speaking without notes, he advanced a reassuring argument deeply rooted in American and Christian traditions. \u201cWe are not wrong,\u201d he declared. \u201cIf we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong.\u201d\nLike a mighty stream\nThey were not wrong\u2014and that may have been the mid-century civil-rights movement\u2019s greatest strength. King\u2019s efforts to overturn legal segregation were at once radical, because African-Americans had been second-class citizens since America\u2019s founding, and based on straightforward American ideals. He understood that the country\u2019s promises of freedom and equality were hollow if geography or skin colour could invalidate them.\nMoral suasion was not enough. King also led the most successful pressure campaign in American history, enduring beatings, bombings, imprisonment, scorn, the arms\u2019-length caution of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson\u2019s two-faced truculence, and illegal monitoring and harassment by the FBI. Within a decade of his address in Holt Street, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. He signed the Fair Housing Act, outlawing discrimination in housing, a week after an assassin\u2019s bullet ended King\u2019s life in 1968.\nYet by the time King died many considered him yesterday\u2019s man. His opposition to the war in Vietnam alienated some of his compatriots. The civil-rights movement had splintered, as more radical voices, such as Stokely Carmichael\u2019s, grew louder. Many white Americans saw ending segregation as the movement\u2019s goal, when, for King, it was just the start: his aim was brotherhood and equality. As the 55 years since his death have shown, achieving those through policy is fiendishly difficult.\nA difficult goal can be worth striving for, however. And it does King and his quest an injustice to suggest he called only for colour-blindness and not, as he put it in 1967, \u201ca reconstruction of the entire society\u201d, perhaps involving the nationalisation of industry and a guaranteed basic income. Such ideas may be discomforting, including for those who would enlist King as an opponent of CRT: always sceptical of \u201cthe tranquillising drug of gradualism\u201d, he came to believe that most Americans \u201care unconscious racists\u201d. But those were still his views, even if expressing them could spell trouble for a teacher in Florida. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot
