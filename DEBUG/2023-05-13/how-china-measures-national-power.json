Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-china-measures-national-power", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "IN \u201cGUANZI\u201d, a text from the seventh century BC, a statesman thought to be called Guan Zhong lays out the \u201ceight views\u201d needed to assess a country\u2019s status. \u201cTour its mountains and lakes,\u201d he says, \u201cobserve its agriculture, and calculate its production of six types of livestock. Then, it will be apparent whether a country is wealthy or destitute.\u201d These days, Chinese scholars employ different methods, but their aim is the same: to assess the balance of power in a hostile world. \nMeasuring power matters because you do not want to fight a war unless you are confident of winning. As the military strategist Sun Tzu explained a century after Guan Zhong: \u201cHe who knows himself and knows others shall be victorious in every battle\u2026he who knows neither shall be defeated in every battle.\u201d\nIf the theory is simple, actually measuring power is fraught with arbitrary judgments and subjectivity. But that has not stopped Chinese scholars from trying to compute what has come to be known as Comprehensive National Power, or CNP. \nIn the 1980s Chinese scholars started by looking at the power equations drawn up in the West, but found them wanting. A formula devised by Ray Cline, a CIA analyst, was dismissed for being too narrow in scope and too subjective. Deng Xiaoping, China\u2019s reformist leader, had stated: \u201cIn measuring a country\u2019s national power, one must look at it comprehensively and from all sides.\u201d To cater to these demands, Chinese experts started to design their own models.\nThey ran into some problems. One is that the more complete the range of variables, the harder it is to allocate weights to them. In a paper from 2002, Hu Angang and Men Honghua, then of Tsinghua University, listed eight categories of resources, taking in everything from farmland to computers. CNP is calculated as a weighted average of these resources as a share of the world\u2019s total. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has a similar model, but uses different indicators and weightings. Who is right? Some indexes rely for their weightings on polls of experts, but that\u2019s just a sophisticated version of the conventional wisdom.\n\nAnother problem is that the calculation of CNP produces a single number, but the components that make it up are not interchangeable. In theory CNP could predict that a widely admired country which defends its world-class dance troupes with a gunboat and a couple of tanks will be able to hold its own against a Philistine horde that spends all its money on weapons. \nWhat\u2019s more, effective power depends on the context. A country\u2019s cultural exports can convey soft power, but they are of little use in a war. David Baldwin of Princeton University writes that assessing power without a context is like discussing what makes up a good hand without specifying the card game. \nYou might think all those complications would be enough to knock CNP on the head. Instead, it has spurred researchers to come up with their own, improved versions. The Economist has counted 69 of them. Not to be deterred, we have added to the pile. Drawing inspiration from an article by Michael Beckley of Tufts University, we zoom in on the three essential ingredients of national power: economic heft, productive efficiency and military might. \nA country cannot be powerful if its economy is inefficient. In the 19th century China lost two opium wars to Britain, despite having a GDP twice the size. On the other hand, neither can a country be powerful if its economy is efficient but small. Luxembourg has not won many wars. And countries cannot fight without a decent army. In the Song dynasty the deadly Mongol cavalry outmatched even the finest Chinese infantry.\nOur hard-power index therefore uses GDP per person to stand for efficiency, military expenditure for might, and non-military GDP for economic heft. These are multiplied, so that countries suffer for their deficiency in any one of them. In the extreme, if any element is zero, then a country\u2019s power is zero, too. \nOf course, old weapon stocks and nuclear arms also convey might. And GDP does not always translate into economic heft or efficiency. But, at least in the current era, our proxies seem reasonable enough. \nBy our measure, China has been gaining on America, but the latter is still comfortably on top. Sun Tzu would predict peace for a good few years yet. \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of
