from a tsunami of covid-19 infections that began to crash over the country a few weeks earlier, after the lifting of nearly three years of draconian pandemic controls. Officials were covering up the horrific scale of the wave\u2019s lethality, but most people\u2019s lives were returning to normal. The Communist Party felt the time was right to publish a speech by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s supreme leader, that he had delivered a year earlier, as the economy reeled from the impact of his \u201czero-covid\u201d policy. It was not about the crisis at hand, but about history. \nLong before foreign analysts began their recent musings on whether \u201cpeak China\u201d\u2014the height of the country\u2019s power\u2014has been reached or is imminent, Mr Xi had been urging China\u2019s citizens to reflect on the peaks and troughs of the country\u2019s past. He insists that China\u2018s \u201cgreat rejuvenation\u201d, to be achieved by the 100th anniversary of Communist rule in 2049, is \u201cirreversible\u201d. That is, the country will, by then, become even stronger and more influential. But he has stressed the need to avoid mistakes that caused the fall of dynasties during the country\u2019s 2,100-year-long imperial era, which ended in 1911, as well as those that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union 80 years later. Since he took power more than a decade ago, he has often mused on the inconstancy of national greatness and threats to the party\u2019s rule. History clearly haunts him. \nMr Xi talks of the \u201ccyclical nature of history\u201d, whereby strong and prosperous regimes sooner or later unravel. The speech he gave a year ago, to the party\u2019s chief enforcers of internal discipline, was about how China must \u201cjump out\u201d of this historical pattern. State media summarised Mr Xi\u2019s remarks shortly after he delivered them, but the (still only partial) text that was published in January was fuller and more dramatic. In it, Mr Xi\u2019s anxiety is clear. He told the officials that the cyclical tendency was a \u201cmajor issue\u201d, relating to \u201cthe life and death of the party, and the rise or fall or success or failure of our country\u2019s socialist system\u201d.\nDiscussion of this cycle has a long history in China. Official literature traces it back to the party\u2019s days as a guerrilla force at the end of the second world war when its leader, Mao Zedong, was reportedly asked by an inquisitive visitor to his base how the party would avoid the trap. His (disingenuous) answer was \u201cdemocracy\u2014only if people are allowed to supervise the government will it dare not to relax\u201d. Mr Xi insists that China has become democratic already, far more so than Western countries. But state media credit him with another means of avoiding decline. He calls it \u201cself-revolution\u201d, a euphemism for endless purges of officials who are corrupt or disloyal. \nMr Xi dwells on the collapse of the Soviet Union even more than his predecessors did. In his view, its causes were chiefly political: ideological laxity and a lack of discipline within its ruling party. In his published speeches, he does not spend much time on other problems that may have played a part, such as the financial burden of military competition with the West, or the costs of having swathes of the economy under the control of inefficient state-owned enterprises. To Mr Xi, the simple moral is that China\u2019s Communist Party needs to be much tougher. As he puts it, nobody in the Soviet Union was \u201cman enough\u201d to crush opposition when the crunch came. \n\nMr Xi endlessly calls on citizens to show confidence in China\u2019s political system and the party\u2019s policies. But he also warns of mounting perils ahead. \u201cAt present and in the future, we are facing many contradictions, risks and challenges at home and abroad, and we must not take it lightly,\u201d he said in 2016, even before Donald Trump was elected as president and tensions with America began to escalate. If China were to fail to respond effectively, he added, problems in areas such as the economy, society and the environment could \u201cevolve into political contradictions, risks and challenges that will ultimately endanger the party\u2019s ruling status and national security\u201d. \nAs more difficult years loom\u2014with an ageing society, shrinking population and slowing growth\u2014logic might seem to prod Mr Xi to consider economic and social reforms. Useful ones would include scaling back state-owned firms, giving private businesses freer rein in critical parts of the economy and providing rural migrants with fairer access to state-funded health care and education in cities. But his end-of-dynasty fears will complicate decision-making. He views state enterprises as a bulwark of party rule and big private firms, notably those in the tech industry, with suspicion. He sees the middle class as another pillar of support: he may not want to alienate it by appearing to splurge on urban society\u2019s underdogs.  \nThe dilemma is captured in a mid-19th-century book by Alexis de Tocqueville: \u201cThe Old Regime and the Revolution\u201d. Translations of the French historian\u2019s classic work about his country\u2019s revolution in 1789 have been hot sellers in China since the months before Mr Xi took over. It owes its popularity to an unexplained recommendation by Wang Qishan, a party bigwig who became Mr Xi\u2019s chief enforcer of discipline and, later, vice-president (he stepped down in March). Readers comb Tocqueville\u2019s analysis of France\u2019s turmoil for insights into China\u2019s future. \nOne clause is usually highlighted. It is that \u201cexperience teaches that the most critical moment for bad governments is the one which witnesses their first steps toward reform.\u201d It is unlikely that Mr Wang meant to imply that the party was ruling badly, or that reforms should cease. But he could have been suggesting that a period of relative prosperity, such as France experienced before the revolution, can be fraught with political danger. The party must be on its guard. \nLearning from Tacitus\nThere is little sign of regime-threatening discontent brewing in China. But Mr Xi is certainly watchful. In 2019 China\u2019s head of public security said that preventing a \u201ccolour revolution\u201d in China was a priority for the police. Protests in November against the zero-covid policy, though small and scattered, will have reinforced Mr Xi\u2019s concerns. Such open displays of dissent are rare. Even more unusually, some demonstrators called on Mr Xi to step down. \nAs economic growth slows in the years ahead, unease over living standards is likely to grow, and with it Mr Xi\u2019s anxiety. In 2014 he referred to what Chinese scholars call the \u201cTacitus trap\u201d. This is the idea, taken from the Roman historian\u2019s writings, that \u201cwhen a ruler once becomes unpopular, all his acts, be they good or bad, tell against him.\u201d Mr Xi said: \u201cOf course, we haven\u2019t got to this stage yet, but the problems we face can\u2019t be described as unserious. We must use huge energy to resolve them.\u201d Since then, his warnings have become more strident. \u201cThe more we proceed, the harder and more dangerous it gets,\u201d he said in 2018.  Mr Xi has yet to refer publicly to the Peak China concept, but the risks of stalling are clearly on his mind. \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand
