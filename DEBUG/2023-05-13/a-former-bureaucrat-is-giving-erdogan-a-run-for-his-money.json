"KEMAL Kilicdaroglu rarely talks about his personal life, and even less about his religion. But last month the man hoping to replace Recep Tayyip Erdogan as Turkey\u2019s president recorded a video in which he acknowledged he belonged to the Alevi sect, a minority that continues to face prejudice. The move was widely perceived as an attempt to pre-empt attacks by Mr Erdogan against his opponent\u2019s faith. \u201cWe have to respect different beliefs, identities and lifestyles,\u201d Mr Kilicdaroglu tells The Economist at his office in Ankara, when asked why he decided to make the video. \u201cMy main task is to unite.\u201d\nThe 74-year-old opposition leader has his work cut out for him. Mr Erdogan has been fanning the flames of Turkey\u2019s culture wars for more than a decade. Now that the prospect of losing power is looming for the first time in his long career, he has doubled down. In the final stretch of the campaign for presidential and parliamentary elections on May 14th, Mr Erdogan has accused Mr Kilicdaroglu and the rest of the opposition of \u201ctaking orders from terrorists\u201d and courting \u201cdeviant organisations like the LGBT\u201d community. The president\u2019s main coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, recently went one better. \u201cEvery vote for the CHP\u201d, he said on May 4th, referring to Mr Kilicdaroglu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s Party, \u201cis a bullet for our soldiers.\u201d\nSuch inflammatory talk has not fallen on deaf ears. On May 7th stones lobbed by pro-government protesters smashed the windows of a campaign bus carrying the CHP mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, injuring a dozen people. The opposition called the attack, which took place in Erzurum, a city in eastern Turkey, a government provocation. Mr Erdogan said Mr Imamoglu incited the violence.\n\nMr Kilicdaroglu, looking slightly frazzled, possibly by the pace of the campaign, says he will heal the divisions Turkey\u2019s strongman has sown. But he has an election to win first. Most polls give the CHP leader a narrow edge over Mr Erdogan. But unless either man receives an absolute majority on May 14th a run-off will take place two weeks later. That seems the more likely scenario, because two other first-round candidates are expected to receive a combined 5% or so of the vote.\nYet Mr Kilicdaroglu hopes to win in round one. \u201cTurkey cannot afford to lose any more time,\u201d he says, referring to the need to tame inflation and corruption, breathe life into the Turkish lira and attract foreign investment. \u201cWe need to restore confidence, abroad and at home.\u201d \nOpposition supporters fear a run-off could give Mr Erdogan time to make up ground by stoking more division, promising more handouts and using his control over state institutions. He has already commandeered public resources for his campaign, offered millions of households free natural gas and launched one megaproject after another. The country\u2019s captive media have risen to the occasion. The state news channel gave Turkey\u2019s leader over 32 hours of live coverage last month. Mr Kilicdaroglu got 32 minutes.\nMr Kilicdaroglu has already done a fair deal of uniting. Over the past few years he has brought together the CHP, which he has headed since 2010, the nationalist Good Party and four smaller parties to form the Nation Alliance. He has also transformed his own party. In the 2000s, the staunchly secular CHP refused to have anything to do with the elected president because his wife wore an Islamic headscarf, and refused to discuss new rights for the Kurds, Turkey\u2019s biggest ethnic minority. Mr Kilicdaroglu has dumped some of the ideological baggage, and it has paid dividends. Turkey\u2019s main Kurdish party, the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), formally endorsed him last month.\nHis priorities, says Mr Kilicdaroglu, would be the economy and rule of law. Both are in bad shape. Mr Erdogan\u2019s conviction that bringing down interest rates stabilises prices, a misguided theory reborn as government policy, has unleashed annualised inflation that topped 85% last year, before easing to 44% last month. Mr Kilicdaroglu and company say they would allow the central bank to raise rates, slow or stop the sale of dollar reserves, and lure back foreign investors.\nMr Kilicdaroglu says Turkey needs to be pulled back from the brink of dictatorship. \u201cThe legislature and the courts are in the hands of one man,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to restore the separation of powers.\u201d He pledges to scrap a law that foresees prison terms for \u201cinsulting\u201d the president, to end Mr Erdogan\u2019s policy of sacking elected HDP mayors and to implement decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. This would mean freedom for Osman Kavala, a philanthropist sentenced to life in prison on farcical coup charges; Selahattin Demirtas, a former leader of the HDP; and perhaps other political prisoners.\nBut Mr Kilicdaroglu may struggle to deliver on his promise to dismantle Mr Erdogan\u2019s executive presidency and hand power back from his 1,150-room palace to the country\u2019s 600-seat parliament. Polls suggest the Nation Alliance and the HDP might scrape together a narrow majority in the assembly, but will not come close to the 360 votes needed to put an amended constitution to a referendum. Cohabitation would not look pretty, either. If Mr Kilicdaroglu wins the country\u2019s top office but Mr Erdogan\u2019s coalition retains control of parliament, the new president would have little choice but to govern by decree.\nEven so, Mr Kilicdaroglu says he will take key decisions together with the five other leaders of his alliance and give ministers considerable leeway. Rule by consensus instead of charisma would come naturally to Mr Kilicdaroglu, a former finance-ministry and social-security official. \u201cHe\u2019s a bureaucrat, and his whole personality is shaped by bureaucracy,\u201d says Riza Turmen, a former CHP parliamentarian. \u201cHe\u2019s not a man of radical changes.\u201d\nBut he may be the change Turkey needs. \u201cAlevi\u201d, the video he posted
