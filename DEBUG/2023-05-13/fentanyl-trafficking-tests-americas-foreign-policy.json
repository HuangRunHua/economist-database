The gun-control law Congress passed in 2022 made it a federal crime to purchase a gun for criminals, and increased arms-trafficking sentences. \nThe DEA is focused on taking out the Sinaloa cartel and the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG), the other big player in the fentanyl trade. \u201cTackling these two cartels is job one for the American people today,\u201d says Anne Milgram, the DEA\u2019s boss.\nWhat about China? The Trump administration successfully lobbied Xi Jinping in 2019 to ban the illicit production and sale of fentanyl. Sales of the drug from China to America all but stopped, but shipments were routed through Mexico instead. As tensions rose between China and America, Chinese officials saw no reason to co-operate on drugs. China ended any remaining counter-narcotics collaboration after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022.\nA report from America\u2019s Treasury Department suggests criminal groups from China launder cash for the cartels by selling the drug dollars to rich Chinese who want to evade China\u2019s capital controls. Joni Ernst, a Republican senator from Iowa, recently said she thinks China is \u201cintentionally poisoning\u201d Americans. The Biden administration seems to suspect gross negligence rather than asymmetric warfare.\nAmerican officials are struggling with how to disrupt trafficking while also recognising the failures of the war on drugs, not least the harm done to African-Americans, who were disproportionately imprisoned for low-level and non-violent drug crimes. The DEA wants to rebrand the effort. \u201cWe talk about this as not a war on drugs but a fight to save lives,\u201d says Ms Milgram. \nThe trouble is that trying to disrupt drug-trafficking is akin to battling a Hydra. In Greek mythology, when Hercules severed one of the serpent\u2019s heads, two more grew in its place. If China stops exporting precursor chemicals, more will come from India. If the DEA destroys the Sinaloa cartel, the CJNG may become public enemy number one. If San Diego\u2019s border crossings become impassable, Tucson in Arizona may take over as the channel\u2014indeed, that may be happening already. \u201cWe are not making progress,\u201d says David Trone, a Democratic congressman from Maryland who co-chaired a bipartisan commission on synthetic-opioid trafficking. \nBut there are things that lawmakers can do, even without help from Mexico or China, to reduce deaths. States could legalise fentanyl-test strips, which are considered drug paraphernalia, so people can know if they are consuming the deadly drug. Congress could expand access to buprenorphine and methadone, drugs that help treat opioid addiction. The Biden administration recently made naloxone available over the counter.\n\u201cKeep people alive,\u201d says Mr Trone, who lost his nephew in 2016 to a fentanyl overdose. \u201cThat\u2019s the answer.\u201d With more than 100,000 dead each year, even marginal gains may save thousands of lives. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only

"Article", "articleBody": "AT THE FAR south-west corner of America lies the busiest border crossing in the western hemisphere. People and goods constantly cruise through the port of San Ysidro, which connects Tijuana in Mexico with San Diego in California. But more nefarious things cross too. Nearly half of the fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, seized by Customs and Border Patrol agents since 2020 has been captured near San Diego. \u201cI\u2019m ground zero,\u201d says Todd Gloria, the mayor of the city.\n\nAmerica\u2019s 20-year opioid epidemic has been shaped by changes in supply. First pharmaceutical companies blanketed the country in legal painkillers. Doctors expanded the use of opioids against chronic pain, such as backache, in the false belief that the risks of addiction were extremely low. By the time OxyContin was reformulated in 2010 to make it harder to abuse, Mexican traffickers were peddling cheap heroin sent to addicts\u2019 doorsteps. Around 2014, more Americans started fatally overdosing on fentanyl, 50 times more potent than heroin, which traffickers had mixed in with heroin or cocaine. Overdose deaths rocketed (see chart).\nFentanyl is the deadliest drug threat America has faced. It killed nearly 108,000 people in the 12 months to August 2022, more than the number of Americans who died fighting wars in Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan combined. Ever more seems to be entering the country. Nearly 14,000 pounds of fentanyl was seized between October and March, almost as much as the total for fiscal-year 2022. Most of the people convicted of fentanyl trafficking between 2018 and 2021 were American citizens, not Mexicans or asylum-seekers.\nThe epidemic is mutating again. Fentanyl is being mixed with xylazine, or tranq, an animal tranquilliser that can amplify its effects. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of pills seized in 2022 contained xylazine. Because tranq is not an opioid, an overdose cannot be reversed with naloxone, a live-saving antidote. Officials in California are worried about addicts shifting from ingesting pills to smoking fentanyl powder. Modelling from the Stanford-Lancet Commission on the North American Opioid Epidemic suggests that 1.2m more people could die by 2029. \nLast month American prosecutors indicted 28 people involved in the fentanyl trade, including the \u201cChapitos\u201d, the sons of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, the former leader of Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa cartel who is serving a life sentence in a Colorado prison. The charges provide a rare glimpse into the cartel, which prosecutors suggest is the biggest trafficker of fentanyl into America. The Chapitos deny the indictments\u2019 allegations. \nThe documents support some things already widely suspected: that Mexican cartels order the precursor chemicals for fentanyl from China. The chemicals are flown or shipped to Mexico, sometimes via countries such as Germany or Guatemala, then cooked into fentanyl in clandestine laboratories in the mountains of Sinaloa. The finished product is transported by land, sea, air and even tunnels to safe houses in Los Angeles, Phoenix and El Paso, to be distributed across America. \nBut some details shed new light on just how brutal and lucrative the fentanyl trade can be. The DEA reckons the cartel can make a fentanyl pill for ten cents. The charges suggest that the Chapitos can then sell pills wholesale for 50 cents in America, which dealers will hawk for several dollars on the street. The documents allege that just one cartel operative in Los Angeles managed to launder $24m in roughly two years. \nFentanyl is testing America\u2019s relations with Mexico and China. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico\u2019s president, often known as AMLO, has denied that fentanyl is made in his country, and suggested that the epidemic reflected a \u201clack of love\u201d within American families.\nLower-level Mexican and American officials continue to collaborate, though not as closely as they did during the presidency of Felipe Calder\u00f3n, who launched Mexico\u2019s war on organised crime in 2006. This month Mexico\u2019s Congress approved a strict new law mandating ten- to 15-year prison sentences for those convicted of producing fentanyl or providing precursor chemicals.\nAMLO\u2019s defensiveness is in response to calls by some Republican politicians to designate Mexican cartels as terrorist organisations, and to send American forces to fight them\u2014with or without Mexico\u2019s permission. Some Mexicans worry that the issue may become a litmus test for Republican presidential hopefuls. \u201cIt\u2019s going to become a political pi\u00f1ata,\u201d warns Arturo Sarukhan, who was Mexico\u2019s ambassador to America from 2007 to 2013. \u201cThey\u2019re going to try and out-Trump Trump to see who is the hardliner on what to do with Mexico.\u201d \nWar, what is it good for?\nIncreased attention to the epidemic is welcome. Drug overdoses have claimed 1m American lives since 1999, and the policy response has been sluggish and disorganised. But Republicans may have a second, more cynical, reason for their bellicose rhetoric. It is good politics. \nIn 1972, a year after declaring the war on drugs and weeks before an election, Richard Nixon said heroin-dealers \u201cmust be hunted to the end of the Earth\u201d. In 2016 Donald Trump touted his border wall as a way to stop not just migrants but drugs, too. President Joe Biden seems alert to the political threat. As well as the indictments of the Chapitos, and new sanctions on their suppliers, his administration is splashing out on more border-patrol agents and high-tech scanners at border crossings. \nThe epidemic has proved deadly south of the border, too: the cartels\u2019 turf wars have led to horrific violence. Mexican officials warn America that its inability to crack down on gun-smuggling means it is arming the cartels. America\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found that 70% of guns recovered in Mexico between 2014 and 2018 came from the United States. Mexico has sued gunmakers in America for $10bn in damages. Some small progress is being made. The gun-control law Congress passed in 2022 made it a federal crime to purchase a gun for criminals, and increased arms-trafficking sentences. \nThe DEA is focused on taking out the Sinaloa cartel and the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG), the other big player in the fentanyl trade. \u201cTackling these two cartels is job one for the American people today,\u201d says Anne Milgram, the DEA\u2019s boss.\nWhat about China? The Trump administration successfully lobbied Xi Jinping in 2019 to ban the illicit production and sale of fentanyl. Sales of the drug from China to America all but stopped, but shipments were routed through Mexico instead. As tensions rose between China and America, Chinese officials saw no reason to co-operate on drugs. China ended any remaining counter-narcotics collaboration after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in 2022.\nA report from America\u2019s Treasury Department suggests criminal groups from China launder cash for the cartels by selling the drug dollars to rich Chinese who want to evade China\u2019s capital controls. Joni Ernst, a Republican senator from Iowa, recently said she thinks China is \u201cintentionally poisoning\u201d Americans. The Biden administration seems to suspect gross negligence rather than asymmetric warfare.\nAmerican officials are struggling with how to disrupt trafficking while also recognising the failures of the war on drugs, not least the harm done to African-Americans, who were disproportionately imprisoned for low-level and non-violent drug crimes. The DEA wants to rebrand the effort. \u201cWe talk about this as not a war on drugs but a fight to save lives,\u201d says Ms Milgram. \nThe trouble is that trying to disrupt drug-trafficking is akin to battling a Hydra. In Greek mythology, when Hercules severed one of the serpent\u2019s heads, two more grew in its place. If China stops exporting precursor chemicals, more will come from India. If the DEA destroys the Sinaloa cartel, the CJNG may become public enemy number one. If San Diego\u2019s border crossings become impassable, Tucson in Arizona may take over as the channel\u2014indeed, that may be happening already. \u201cWe are not making progress,\u201d says David Trone, a Democratic congressman from Maryland who co-chaired a bipartisan commission on synthetic-opioid trafficking. \nBut there are things that lawmakers can do, even without help from Mexico or China, to reduce deaths. States could legalise fentanyl-test strips, which are considered drug paraphernalia, so people can know if they are consuming the deadly drug. Congress could expand access to buprenorphine and methadone, drugs that help treat opioid addiction. The Biden administration recently made naloxone available over the counter.\n\u201cKeep people alive,\u201d says Mr Trone, who lost his nephew in 2016 to a fentanyl overdose. \u201cThat\u2019s the answer.\u201d With more than 100,000 dead each year, even marginal gains may save thousands of lives. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only
