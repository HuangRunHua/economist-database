"articleBody": "Ramsgate Harbour once held a busy fishing fleet. Today the only sign of life is aboard four berthed cutters of the Border Force, whose task is to intercept migrants from dinghies in the English Channel and bring them to shore. As a fifth arrives, an elderly angler leans over the harbour wall. \u201cGet back out there\u201d, he bellows, pointing to sea, \u201cand do some work!\u201d \nGrey, Eurosceptic and itching to give Westminster a bloody nose, furious voters in blustery towns along England\u2019s east coast have been chronicled so often that they are a political clich\u00e9. Anger at immigration and at austerity drove them first into the arms of Nigel Farage\u2019s UK Independence Party (UKIP), then its successor, the Brexit Party, and then its imitator in Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives. Along the way, they pushed Britain out of the EU. \nRamsgate, in east Kent, is still blustery; the locals are still angry. But local elections held in much of England on May 4th sent this mood of insurrection in a surprising new direction. The Labour Party took control of several councils in pro-Brexit areas, including some in Kent. The long realignment of Eurosceptic voters away from Labour is partially unwinding, says Robert Ford of the University of Manchester, who was among the first to spot UKIP\u2019s potential in this region a decade ago. \n\nAround a quarter of Leave voters now back Labour, up from 14% in the 2019 election. Strongly pro-Brexit areas swung most heavily to Labour in the local elections; the party slipped back in Remain strongholds (see chart). That makes its support more efficiently distributed to win a general election. Leave voters are also increasingly hostile to the Tories. \u201cI was at a coronation street party in Kent and I was meeting working-class people saying \u2018Nige, you should have been our prime minister,\u2019\u201d says Mr Farage. \u201cBut they were all voting Labour last week.\u201d \nLabour\u2019s victory on Thanet Council, the district that contains Ramsgate, was especially striking. Mr Farage ran for Parliament here in 2005 and again in 2015, finishing second. In 2015 UKIP took control of the council, the first and last it would run. (The result was shambolic.) The area brought together two wings of UKIP\u2019s support, notes Michael Crick, Mr Farage\u2019s biographer: \u201cretired colonels in blazers, enjoying a G&T after a round of golf\u201d in towns such as Sandwich, and the white working class living on council estates around Ramsgate. Craig Mackinlay, the Tory MP, is a former UKIP bigwig. \n\u201cThe issue of Brexit has faded. It\u2019s just not on their agenda any more,\u201d says Rick Everitt, the local Labour leader. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are dominated by the cost of living and the health service, and they are looking for whoever can best answer those questions.\u201d Britain\u2019s inflation rate stood at 10.1% in the year to March, and hospital waiting lists are not yet falling. Rishi Sunak has made \u201cStop the Boats\u201d one of his main pledges, but even here it is yielding him little electoral reward.  \nThe decision of Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, to make winning back older social conservatives his central objective is bearing fruit. That meant repudiating Jeremy Corbyn, his predecessor, dumping Europhilia and taking a hard line on criminal justice. \u201cYou have to overcorrect constantly for the fact that everyone sitting around the table in any Labour Party meeting is going to be from the cities, university-educated and Remain-inclined,\u201d says one party official. \nUKIP\u2019s supporters typically combined hostility to immigration with left-wing economics, and thought corporations and the rich had it too easy, notes Dr Ford. If the economy dominates their agenda, \u201cthe potential for those voters to come straight back to Labour has always been there.\u201d Sir Keir has described his programme of state intervention as a more faithful response to the Brexit referendum than the Tories\u2019 agenda. In Ramsgate, Labour has also been helped by the pandemic-era arrival of middle-class \u00e9migr\u00e9s from London.\nIn the story of British Euroscepticism, the local elections provided another landmark: UKIP lost all its councillors, the end point of a long retreat from political influence. Reform UK, as the Brexit Party was renamed, also failed to make headway, winning just six councillors and averaging a mere 6% of the vote in wards that it contested. That is a sign of Tory success: a long march to the right on Europe has occupied the space UKIP operated in. But it is also a big problem. In previous general elections, the Tories secured victory by winning over voters who had turned to radical-right parties during local elections. That pool is much smaller now. The towns where the Brexit revolution started are showing the first signs that it may be at an end. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly
