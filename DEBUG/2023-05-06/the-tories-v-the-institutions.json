"https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/05/04/the-tories-v-the-institutions", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "From the perspective of the typical Conservative mp, Richard Sharp was a perfect choice as chairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation (bbc). A former Goldman Sachs banker and committed Brexiteer, Mr Sharp thought the bbc had a \u201cliberal bias\u201d. Mr Sharp was a Tory donor, close to both Boris Johnson, the former prime minister, and Rishi Sunak, the current one. Unfortunately, Mr Sharp was too close to Mr Johnson: he resigned on April 28th for failing to declare his role in introducing the former prime minister to someone willing to lend him money. \nMr Sharp\u2019s departure is the latest example of an often overlooked Conservative failure. The Conservatives have run the country for 13 years. But they have failed to shape its institutions. The Tories have lost almost every fight they have picked\u2014whether against Whitehall or the bbc or the quangos that run British life. Each Conservative government since 2010 has promised to fundamentally alter how Britain works. Each has failed. \nIt is not for want of trying. Every one of those governments has pledged to shake up the civil service, for instance. Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson\u2019s revolutionary adviser, promised a \u201chard rain\u201d on the mandarins; he was gone 18 months later. When senior civil servants themselves are hoofed out, they are replaced by more of the same. Rather than rein in the civil service, the civil service has begun to rein in ministers. Dominic Raab resigned as justice secretary last month after being found to have bullied staff. \nTaming the Treasury, Britain\u2019s overmighty finance department, has been a goal of successive Conservative prime ministers. Liz Truss was simply the most zealous, firing the department\u2019s permanent secretary on day three of her ill-fated 45-day premiership. Theresa May\u2019s team also wanted to restrain the department. Mr Johnson resented the Treasury as an obstacle to his beloved big projects. Yet today the Treasury is stronger than ever. Mr Sunak, a Treasury alumnus, sits in 10 Downing Street; Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, veers little from the department\u2019s orthodoxy. \nIf the Treasury is still supreme despite the efforts of the Conservative Party, so are the technocrats. Ms Truss had a staring contest with the Bank of England, which refused to blink. Ms Truss lost her job. Conservatives may seethe about Andrew Bailey\u2019s performance as the bank\u2019s governor. Inflation is, after all, still skipping along in double digits, albeit owing to factors beyond his control. Yet changing the current set-up is beyond the pale. Even rejigging its mandate, once discussed relatively openly by both parties, is seen as excessive radicalism. What the bank says, goes. \nDavid Cameron proposed a \u201cbonfire of the quangos\u201d, the independent bodies that controlled everything from water regulation to Britain\u2019s charities. They are more powerful than ever. The establishment in 2013 of nhs England, which oversees \u00a3160bn of spending ($200bn; about 7% of British gdp), effectively stripped the health secretary of a say over the day-to-day operations of the health service. The Office for Budget Responsibility, a quango that monitors government spending, now has a near-sacred position that belies the fact it is barely a teenager. \nBrexit was supposed to create a leaner, more efficient British state once the shackles of eu law had been removed. Parliament, rather than officials, would dictate policy. Instead, European red tape has been replaced by British red tape, with eu law effectively copied and pasted into domestic statute. Plans to repeal these laws en masse have been scrapped. This may be wise. But it was not what the Conservatives promised. Rather than strip down regulation or remove legislation, as is supposedly their bent, the Conservatives are much more likely simply to gripe about it. It is easier to complain than to achieve anything, even in government.\nYet an advantage of the British system of government is that quick, sweeping change is possible. Armed with a majority and competent leadership, a government can do what it likes. It took New Labour little time to fundamentally alter the country\u2019s institutions. Within its first few years Labour had passed the Human Rights Act and given the Bank of England its independence. It pushed through devolution to Scotland and Wales. New quangos, such as Ofcom, which regulated broadcasters, were created. \nLabour managed to change both the shape of Britain\u2019s institutions and the people running them. At the start of the Blair era, the establishment was still filled with patrician Tories. British society would have been recognisable to Peter Cook, a 1960s satirist who mocked the reactionary tendencies of its pale, public-school elite. By the end of the New Labour years, the people at the top of Britain\u2019s institutions were, on the whole, far more liberal and diverse. \nSkip forward 13 years and the Conservatives oversee institutions that are largely unchanged from the Blair era. Conservative mps seethe about the influence of European judges on the country\u2019s laws. But they do little about it. Attempts to put their own people into positions of power have largely failed. At least Mr Sharp actually made it into his post. The Conservatives have repeatedly botched plans to install Paul Dacre, the editor-in-chief of DMG Media, which publishes the Tory-supporting Daily Mail and other titles, as head of Ofcom. The Conservatives still live in New Labour\u2019s world, however much they may hate it. \nCheers, Gramsci\u2019s crying \nThe Tory party has no excuses. New Labour knew how they wanted Britain to work. The Conservatives have produced no such vision. Conservatism is in general allergic to big ideas and systemic thinking. Most Tory MPs are happier moaning about institutions than altering them. Instead of learning from its mistakes, the government has given up. Mr Sunak has neither the time nor the inclination to radically alter British institutions between now and the next general election. After more than a decade in power, the Conservatives have not figured out how to reform the state. They may not get another chance for a while. \u25a0\nRead more from Bagehot, our columnist on British politics: \nWould Labour turn to the left in office?
