Africa", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/04/lebanons-government-is-squeezing-out-syrian-refugees", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "The army vehicles drew up outside Umm Mohammad\u2019s home in Lebanon\u2019s foothills just before dawn. Soldiers searched the house before checking the Syrian family\u2019s papers. Three of her sons\u2019 residence permits had lapsed because the authorities are not renewing them these days. The young men were taken to the border and handed over to the Syrian army. They ended up in Aleppo. The older two were given ten days to report for army duty.\nRelief workers have counted more than 60 such raids since the middle of April. There were just 11 during the whole of last year. The expulsions\u2014which Amnesty International says are a violation of international law\u2014are part of a wider crackdown by the Lebanese government on Syrian refugees. Last week it directed local security forces to \u201capply the law\u201d. Parties across the political spectrum have backed the government\u2019s efforts, as have local television stations. Syrians in Lebanon have faced a torrent of abuse on social media.\n\nRefugees began arriving in Lebanon in 2011 after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. Exact numbers are unknown; the government ordered unhcr, the un refugee agency, to stop registering them in 2015. The official figure is 1.5m; the reality may be closer to 2m, in a country with a population of 5m. The government has refused to house Syrians in formal camps so they are scattered around the country (see map), many in squalid informal settlements. \nSyrians in Lebanon have experienced attacks, rhetorical and physical, before. But the latest campaign has been prompted in part by Lebanon\u2019s economic crisis\u2014and is all the more furious as a result. The Lebanese pound has lost more than 98% of its value against the dollar since 2019. Annual inflation is running at over 250%. Most Lebanese struggle to pay their bills.\nThe refugees are a convenient scapegoat. Locals blame them for crime waves and stealing jobs. Some Lebanese claim that Syrians are living comfortably off un and ngo handouts (in dollars) while they starve. The international community has been accused of paying refugees to stay in Lebanon to prevent them from going to Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a conspiracy against Lebanon,\u201d fumed Michel Aoun, a former president, last week.\nBlaming Syrians for the country\u2019s woes suits feuding Lebanese politicians, as it diverts attention away from their own shortcomings. They have so far failed even to agree on a successor to Mr Aoun, who stood down last October. Pushing through reforms agreed with the imf, which would unleash billions of dollars in aid, looks far beyond them. Lebanese have gone from being angry with their own politicians \u201cto finding something else to be angry about\u201d, says an aid official.\nSyrians are more deserving of pity than anger. A large majority cannot make ends meet. Few receive the maximum benefits, which for a family of five or more are the equivalent of $80 (\u00a364) per month. The unhcr says this does not come close to covering a family\u2019s basic needs. They even have to pay rent for tents in remote areas. At a donors\u2019 conference in Brussels in mid-June, the un will ask for $4bn for Lebanon. More of the money will go to Lebanese than Syrians. \nIt is true that Syrians have created pressures in Lebanon. Some have lots of children. Others get mixed up in crime. Some cross back into Syria then return to claim benefits from the un. But if Lebanon gets too heavy-handed with Syrian refugees it could forfeit the support of international donors. And a sudden exit of refugees would have some costs for the economy: many do jobs in construction and agriculture that some Lebanese workers shun. \nThe un and others would favour a safe, voluntary and monitored return of the refugees. For now that seems unlikely so most will stay. But their lives may become increasingly uncomfortable. \u25a0", "description": "Feuding politicians are searching for scapegoats", "ogDescription": "Feuding politicians are searching for scapegoats",
