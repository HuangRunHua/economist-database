"keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/05/04/britain-readies-to-crown-charles-iii-as-its-new-king", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "ON May 6th, in London, a man will be given a hat. He has never seemed that keen on this hat. At the age of 20, King Charles III described the realisation he would be king as dawning upon him \u201cwith the most ghastly inexorable sense\u201d. His predecessors were little keener. King Edward VIII described kingship as \u201can occupation of considerable drudgery\u201d; King George VI awoke on the morning of his coronation with \u201ca sinking feeling\u201d. Britons themselves seem similarly nonplussed. According to YouGov, a pollster, almost half say they are unlikely to watch the coronation, yet everyone has been talking about it for weeks. \nThe coronation, as the royal website explains, is \u201ca solemn religious ceremony\u201d. The reminder is needed, for the list of those participating this weekend includes people with such titles as the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant, the Rouge Croix Pursuivant and the Portcullis Pursuivant. It involves a Garter King of Arms and people with titles so antique that their adjectives appear to be on back-to-front (the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of this realm). It involves beadles, heralds, princesses, kings, queens and His Most Godly Beatitude Theophilos III, Patriarch of Jerusalem and All Palestine. There are \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d episodes with more sober cast lists.  \nThe ceremony that will unfold in Westminster Abbey is little more sensible. It includes a Stone of Destiny, a Sword of Spiritual Justice and oil made with olives harvested from the Monastery of Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem. It demands bowing, scraping, chanting and anointing with chrism from a special Coronation Spoon. It involves far too many men in tights. It has caused the British government\u2019s website\u2014which usually offers clarification on such things as self-assessment tax-return deadlines (January 31st)\u2014to start offering clarification on what the Earl of Erroll will be carrying on the day (a silver baton).\nMonarchy, as even monarchs are apt to point out, doesn\u2019t belong in the modern world. \u201cReally, the day for kings and princes is past,\u201d wrote the future Edward VIII in 1920. \u201cMonarchies are out-of-date.\u201d The 20th century tended to agree. It opened with King Umberto I of Italy being shot by an assassin in 1900. For many royals, things only got worse. The assassinations of the kings of Portugal, Greece and the Tsar of Russia followed; others were booted out. In 1948 King Farouk of Egypt observed that: \u201cSoon there will be only five Kings left\u2026the King of Spades, the King of Clubs, the King of Hearts and the King of Diamonds\u201d\u2014and the King of England.\nThings did not turn out quite as badly as Farouk predicted. Today, 22% of the world\u2019s countries still have a hereditary ruler as their head of state. Though things are not quite as striking as that statistic implies, since many of those monarchs are Charles, who is sovereign of 15 countries. At least for now. Several of his realms have hinted that they may get rid of him. \n\nSome think Britain should join them. The number of Britons considering the monarchy to be \u201cvery important\u201d has, according to the National Centre for Social Research, fallen from 65% in 1983 to 29% today (see chart). PR disasters rather than pitchforks are what unsettle modern monarchies\u2014and the royals have had many. There has been money in suitcases. There has been Prince Andrew. \nRepublic, a pressure group that campaigns for the abolition of the monarchy, argues that the royals fall \u201cwell short of the standards we should expect in public life\u201d. Pro-royal outlets such as the Telegraph and Tatler offer advice on coronation scones; Republic offers a recipe for protest. It encourages people to come to Trafalgar Square on May 6th, bring placards and shout \u201cNot my king\u201d as Charles goes past. It promises speeches and an earnest, principled stand against the monarchy. \nWhich is the big problem with republicanism. \u201cSo long as the human heart is strong and the human reason weak,\u201d argued Walter Bagehot, a renowned Victorian editor of this newspaper, \u201croyalty will be strong\u2026and Republics weak.\u201d As Bagehot realised, the identity of the person who wears the hollow crown is, in a way, irrelevant. What matters is the sparkle. \nThe British royal family might be anachronism incarnate; it might offer uncomfortable imperialist echoes and entrenched inequality. But it also offers chrism and crowns, scones and jam, and men on horseback with tubas. The proportion of Britons who want to abolish the monarchy has risen over the years\u2014from 3% in 1983 to 14% now; among 18-34 year-olds the figure is over 20%. But this is scarcely the stuff of revolution.\nAnd working royals do work. They hardly toil in mines but they do visit unenviable numbers of regional manufacturing centres. On a single day in March Princess Anne visited a stable and an industrial park in Birmingham while Charles went to Hamburg-Dammtor Railway Station in Germany and the \u201cfuture site of the Green Energy Hub Hamburg\u201d to hear about its \u201congoing transition to a carbon-free port\u201d.\nThey do so without complaining. Mostly. In 1984 Princess Margaret made a guest appearance on \u201cThe Archers\u201d, a long-running Radio 4 soap opera. On it, she acted as herself, attending a charity fashion event. When she finished reading her lines, the producer offered her guidance. \u201cThat\u2019s very good, ma\u2019am,\u2019 he said. \u201cBut do you think you could sound as if you were enjoying yourself a little more?\u201d Princess Margaret replied: \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t be, would I?\u201d\nThe people watching a coronation rehearsal one night earlier this week, as the clocks of London strike midnight, are enjoying themselves. The roads around Trafalgar Square are unusually quiet. They have been shut to allow the military to practise. There is a shout. Suddenly the street fills with soldiers, sailors, horses and the sort of scene that demands vocabulary more commonly seen in Horatio Hornblower novels\u2014bayonets, breeches, postilions and rapiers.
