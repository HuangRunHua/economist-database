Republic Bank, a regional lender based in San Francisco, and placed it into federal receivership. Much of the bank was then sold to JPMorgan Chase following a bidding auction. It is America\u2019s second-biggest banking failure ever. The rescue didn\u2019t do much to placate fears about the health of other midsized regional banks. The share price of Pacific Western Bank slumped after the lender was reported to be exploring its strategic options. \nThe Federal Reserve issued a stinging report into the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. It blamed SVB\u2019s management as well as itself for not appreciating \u201cthe seriousness of critical deficiencies\u201d at the bank, and said that legislation passed in Congress in 2018 had lowered supervisory standards. It called for stronger regulations. The report also noted that social media is a factor that \u201cmay have fundamentally changed the speed of bank runs\u201d. \nThe Fed lifted its benchmark interest rate by another quarter of a percentage point, to a range of between 5% and 5.25%. It was the tenth consecutive increase, though markets interpreted a slight change in the central bank\u2019s guidance to think it may be the last in this particular cycle. \nThe European Central Bank increased its deposit rate by a quarter of a point, to 3.25%. Consumer-price inflation in the euro zone rose slightly in April to 7% at an annual rate. The currency bloc\u2019s economy grew by 1.3% in the first quarter, year on year, a slower pace than in the previous three quarters by that measure.    \nThe Reserve Bank of Australia surprised markets when it raised its rate by a quarter of a point, to 3.85%. The bank had left the rate on hold in April, suggesting that a rapid run of increases was over. \nThe disruptive potential of generative artificial intelligence came into sharp focus when Chegg, a provider of online study aids, said that the use of ChatGPT by students was starting to affect revenues. Although the chief executive tried to assure investors that this \u201cis not a sky-is-falling thing\u201d and the effects are \u201cjust on the margin\u201d, Chegg\u2019s share price swooned, dragging down the stock of other online education companies. \nThe big picture\nThe Writers Guild of America called its first strike for 15 years, in a dispute over pay with studios such as Apple, Disney and Netflix. The television and film writers say the studios are creating \u201ca gig economy\u201d in the industry, for example by moving to \u201cday rates\u201d in comedy variety. It also wants to restrict the use of AI in creating scripts. The last stoppage by Hollywood\u2019s script writers lasted 100 days. \nGeoffrey Hinton, one of the pioneers of AI, resigned from Google in order to speak his mind about the technology. Mr Hinton, 75, said AI was developing too rapidly and the idea that it would outsmart people was no longer \u201c30 to 50 years\u201d away. Humans are \u201cbiological systems and these are digital systems\u201d, he warned, as he called for more safety protocols for AI. \nBig oil companies made record profits last year on the back of soaring oil prices. With oil now much less dear, profits are expected to decline, though there wasn\u2019t much evidence of that in the first quarter. BP reported an underlying profit of $5bn, higher than expected but below the $6.2bn it made in the same quarter last year. Shell\u2019s adjusted profit of $9.6bn was an improvement on its performance a year ago, as was Chevron\u2019s net profit of $6.6bn. ExxonMobil\u2019s net income doubled, to $11.4bn. \nArm, a British chip designer that is being spun off by SoftBank, filed papers for an IPO later this year. It is expected to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange and could raise up to $10bn, which would make it one of the largest IPOs in America in the past decade.\nGo First, a discount airline in India, entered bankruptcy protection, blaming the grounding of half its fleet on problems with Pratt & Whitney engines, an issue that is affecting other Indian airlines. This came soon after news that domestic air travel in India had hit a record high as 456,000 passengers flew in a single day.
