"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/04/30/are-greedy-corporations-causing-inflation", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "In the three years before covid-19, rich-world consumer prices rose by a total of 6%. In the three years since they have risen by close to 20%. People are looking for a villain\u2014and firms often top the list. According to a recent survey by Morning Consult, a pollster, a third of Americans believe that \u201ccompanies\u2019 attempts to maximise profits\u201d have contributed \u201cthe most\u201d to inflation, more than any other factor by far. \nIt is not just the public who blame fat cats. \u201cRecent inflation has been driven by an unusual expansion of profit margins,\u201d Paul Donovan of ubs, a bank, has argued. A study by America\u2019s Bureau of Labour Statistics (bls) suggests \u201cdealer mark-up\u201d has raised the price of new vehicles. Central bankers are getting in on the act, too. Last month Fabio Panetta of the European Central Bank said \u201cthere could be an increase in inflation due to increasing profits.\u201d Last year Lael Brainard, formerly of the Federal Reserve, now a White House official, said that \u201creductions in mark-ups could also make an important contribution to reduced pricing pressures\u201d. \nThe problem is that, at an aggregate level, evidence for head-honcho greed is thin on the ground. What seems to be happening is that families and firms are sharing the spoils of the post-pandemic economy. This makes sense. Arguments for \u201cgreedflation\u201d rest on unsure theoretical ground. Firms did not suddenly become avaricious. Red-hot demand, linked in part to massive stimulus programmes in 2020-21, is the true source of price pressure\u2014and can sometimes result in margins expanding. \n\nThe theory also fails on its own terms. To believe that corporations are making out like bandits is to believe they are winning the fundamental battle in economics. Output must flow either to owners of capital\u2014in the form of profits, dividends and rents\u2014or to labour, as pay and perks. Economists refer to this as the \u201ccapital\u201d or \u201clabour\u201d share of gdp. When one group wins, by definition the other must lose. \n\nWe have estimated the labour share across the oecd, a group of mostly rich countries. For much of the pandemic this was above its average during the preceding decade, suggesting that labour had the upper hand (see chart 1). In 2020 companies continued to pay people\u2019s wages\u2014helped by stimulus programmes\u2014even as gdp dropped. In 2021 and 2022 strong demand for labour allowed many existing workers to demand more pay. It also pulled new people into the workforce. Across the oecd the share of working-age folk in a job is at an all-time high of 70%. \nAnother way of assessing the balance of power is to look at \u201cunit prices\u201d. The second chart shows recent changes in the price of an average American good or service, split into the relative contributions of profits and labour costs. Corporations had the early spoils, but since 2021 workers have fought back. A calculation for the euro area published in a recent paper by Goldman Sachs, a bank, also suggests a relatively even match-up. If you are fuming at paying $10 for a coffee, blame the barista serving it to you as much as the owner. \nRecent months have been tougher for companies. In the first quarter of this year profit margins at those in the s&p 500 index of big American firms are expected to sharply drop, perhaps because consumer tolerance for higher prices has worn thin. Workers, though, seem to be holding their own. The oecd\u2019s headline rate of inflation is now decisively declining, even as there is little evidence of slowing wage growth. The latest monthly data from the bls show that, after falling for much of 2021 and 2022, American hourly real pay is rising once again. David has not defeated Goliath, but he is putting up a good fight. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "description": "That is the popular narrative.
