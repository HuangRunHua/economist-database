capital. Two centuries ago lawmakers from Pensacola on the territory\u2019s western coast and St Augustine on the eastern one grew tired of traversing 400 miles to meet. In 1824 Tallahassee was named the capital as a compromise, because it was in the middle. Today middle ground and compromise have vanished in Tallahassee, where the governor\u2019s office and both chambers of the legislature are controlled by Republicans. On May 5th Florida\u2019s lawmakers will conclude their annual session, which will be remembered as a conservative tide washing over the state. \n\u201cFour sessions\u2019 worth of legislation\u201d was done in one session, boasts Paul Renner, the Republican speaker of the Florida House: \u201cIn scope, it is unlike any other.\u201d Ideas that for decades were politically unfeasible have been signed into law. These include a ban on abortions after six weeks of gestation, the \u201cpermitless carry\u201d of guns (requiring no training or background check) and a \u201cuniversal\u201d school-voucher scheme. (Parents can use public-school funds to send their children to private schools or teach them at home, regardless of income.)\nThis might sound surprising for what used to be a swing state in presidential elections\u2014remember the \u201changing chads\u201d of 2000. The Sunshine State still has a large share of independent voters: 28% are registered as having no party affiliation. Two forces are at work. One is the rise of Ron DeSantis, the governor, as a likely presidential contender. After his re-election last November, when he won by more than 19 points, some national donors viewed him as the Republicans\u2019 best chance of defeating Donald Trump. Although he has not yet announced his run, he is using his state as a stage to project his \u201cFlorida blueprint\u201d for the rest of the country. In this session, his strategy has been to push to the right of Mr Trump to appeal to primary voters.\nSecond, though the legislature has been under their control since 1997, the election in November handed Republicans new super-majorities (of at least two-thirds) in both chambers. This is only the second time Republicans have held such majorities, and it is the largest margin they have ever held, says Aubrey Jewett, at the University of Central Florida. Bills have passed without much need for compromise.\nThe two chambers have fallen into lockstep under Mr DeSantis\u2019s command. Ambition surely plays a part in this, with lawmakers hoping to see their loyalty repaid with plum jobs if Mr DeSantis ends up in the White House. But Jeff Brandes, a former Republican state senator, thinks it is \u201cmostly fear\u201d. Mr DeSantis has shown a willingness to strike back against legislators who cross him. \nNearly every one of Mr DeSantis\u2019s legislative priorities has passed, as have a few bills pandering to him. One of those reverses the \u201cresign to run\u201d law in Florida, no longer requiring a person to step down from current office if they seek the presidency or vice-presidency. Another shields Mr DeSantis from public-record requests involving his travel with government funds, ostensibly for security reasons.\nAround 25-30% of the legislature\u2019s time this session has been taken up with \u201cculture-war issues\u201d, reckons Randy Fine, a Republican House member. As well as guns and abortion, Mr DeSantis\u2019s \u201canti-woke\u201d crusades have included ratcheting up his long-running conflict with Disney and attempts to restrict \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d initiatives. Even some of his biggest backers have grown confounded by how far he has pushed things\u2014including a proposal to expand last year\u2019s ban on classroom discussions of gender identity and sexuality, known by critics as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, from the third grade (ages 7-8) to the 12th (17-18). \nSocial issues may stir the Republican base, but none ranks as the main concern for the average Florida voter. (Affordable housing comes top, followed by the economy, according to a poll in March by the University of North Florida.) The legislature has set aside funds and changed height and zoning rules to boost the supply of affordable housing, and passed a tort-reform law to cut lawsuits, including those for property insurance, which in Florida costs nearly triple the national average. Still, many Florida-watchers are unimpressed. \u201cI wonder what this legislative session would have looked like if Governor DeSantis had decided to stay governor,\u201d says Mr Brandes, who thinks \u201che would have been much more willing to deal with the pressing problems in Florida\u201d.\nQuestions of character\nThe session has also given a somewhat unflattering outline of what Mr DeSantis might be like in higher office. \u201cI think he is telling voters who he is, and we should believe him,\u201d says Fentrice Driskell, the Democratic leader of the state House. He has shown a reactive streak. After a jury last year could not reach a unanimous decision about whether to sentence the perpetrator who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, to the death penalty, Mr DeSantis pushed to change the law. Now someone can be sentenced to death with four of 12 jurors dissenting, making Florida one of only two states (together with Alabama) not to require unanimity for the death penalty. \nHis fight with Disney has shown a tendency for retaliation and willingness to push to extremes. Last spring, after the then-boss of Disney spoke out against the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law, Mr DeSantis and the legislature stripped Disney of its special taxation and governance privileges. At first, dressing down a \u201cwoke\u201d corporation looked an easy win, but it has turned into a distraction. Mr DeSantis has suggested that the state could build a prison near Disney World. Disney recently filed a lawsuit arguing that the state\u2019s bullying behaviour is unconstitutional, and a board appointed by Mr DeSantis has responded with its own countersuit. Even some of Mr DeSantis\u2019s allies are privately critical, saying a pro-business state should not target a company for speaking out.\nMore people are questioning his political shrewdness. Some worried about his criticism of American support for Ukraine, which he belittled as a \u201cterritorial dispute\u201d. He had already sated the Republican base last year when he signed a 15-week abortion ban; the six-week ban passed in this session pushed away donors. \u201cI can think of a huge number of people down here who don\u2019t want any part of him, because of the last 60 days,\u201d says a Republican businessman and former DeSantis donor in Florida, who calls his behaviour with Disney \u201cvindictive, autocratic and absurd\u201d. \nAlthough Mr DeSantis has a war chest that Politico, a political-news website, estimates at $110m (including political-action-committee funds), his popularity has flagged compared with Mr Trump\u2019s. A recent poll carried out by YouGov for The Economist shows that 53% of Republicans would prefer to see Mr Trump as the Republican nominee in 2024, compared with 31% for Mr DeSantis. That is a striking reversal from last November, when 46% favoured the governor and 39% the former president. Mr Trump has experience of seeing off a Floridian governor. Jeb Bush, widely thought to be a front-runner for the Republican nomination in 2016, quickly withered in the face of Mr Trump\u2019s attacks.\nRecently members of Congress from Florida have come out to endorse Mr Trump, with only one publicly backing Mr DeSantis. \u201cDeSantis lives in a very insular world, where he doesn\u2019t reach out to members,\u201d says Mr Brandes. \u201cI don\u2019t know who in the legislature he\u2019s actually close to, after five years of watching.\u201d\nBut whatever befalls Mr DeSantis\u2019s presidential run, he will continue to make a mark on the country. Some of his policies, such as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law, are already spreading to other states. One of Florida\u2019s new laws raises criminal penalties for transporting illegal immigrants and requires hospitals to record people\u2019s immigration status. It is \u201cone of the most sweeping and targeted immigration bills in the country\u201d and will be used as a model by other states, predicts Maggie Mick of Multistate, a government-relations firm. Even if the \u201cFlorida blueprint\u201d does not prove to be a road map to the White House, it will still inspire other Republican-controlled states to copy Florida\u2019s plans. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.
