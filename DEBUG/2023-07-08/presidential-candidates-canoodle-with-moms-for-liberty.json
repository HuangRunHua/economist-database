"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/06/presidential-candidates-canoodle-with-moms-for-liberty", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "According to Catalina Stubbe, under the guise of sex education Florida schools are teaching boys to masturbate. This may be the result of demonic forces she saw at work in her own child\u2019s classroom. When her seven-year-old\u2019s maths homework repeatedly featured the number 666 (interpreted by some to signal the devil) she knew there were leftists behind it. Ms Stubbe is not only the  parent of a schoolchild in Florida. She is the national director of Hispanic outreach for Moms for Liberty, a parents\u2019-rights group made up of self-proclaimed \u201cjoyful warriors\u201d who refuse to \u201cco-parent with the government\u201d.\nBorn out of the pandemic anti-mask movement, the organisation now boasts 120,000 members. Its enthusiasts attend school-board meetings across 45 states to get books containing obscene images, critical race theory (CRT) or gender ideology stripped from library shelves. On June 29th hundreds of \u201cmama bears\u201d gathered in Philadelphia, where the Declaration of Independence was written and thus American liberty was born, to mobilise to protect their cubs from the \u201cK-12 cartel\u201d. \nThe country\u2019s top Republicans came to court them. Five presidential candidates, including the front-runners, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, spoke at the four-day event. Vivek Ramaswamy, a businessman-turned-politician, vowed to defund the Department of Education and Mr Trump promised to let parents fire principals. All committed to battling the \u201cindoctrination\u201d of children. \nTheir ringing endorsements came after Moms for Liberty was dubbed an anti-government extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Centre (SPLC), a non-profit civil-rights organisation, in June. It gives the designation to groups that traffic in conspiracy theories and believe the government is tyrannical. After a year\u2019s monitoring it characterised Moms for Liberty\u2019s work as a crusade to \u201cdismantle public schools\u201d and promote anti-LGBTQ curriculums while accusing the left of \u201cgrooming\u201d children. Much of what is documented in the report, however, looks more like fairly regular right-wing organising. Nikki Haley, chasing a long-shot presidential nomination, tweeted: \u201cIf @Moms4Liberty is a \u2018hate group,\u2019 add me to the list\u201d.\nMaternal instincts\nThe Moms scoff at the label and say they simply aim to depoliticise classrooms and protect children from age-inappropriate content. But last year an Arkansas Mom was investigated for threatening to gun down local librarians, and in June an Indiana chapter quoted Adolf Hitler in its newsletter. National leaders say that the quote, \u201cHe alone, who OWNS the youth, GAINS the future\u201d, was not meant to praise Hitler but rather to warn against \u201cmonsters\u201d who control classrooms (a photo of Joe Biden ran with the message). Liberals called them \u201cKlanned Parenthood\u201d and \u201cMoms of the Third Reich\u201d. Tia Bess, Moms for Liberty\u2019s director of engagement, who is black and gay, points to her involvement as evidence that the group has \u201czero racism or homophobia\u201d. \nMoms for Liberty\u2019s rapid ascent into the heart of Republican politics proves it hit a nerve. Since Glenn Youngkin campaigned against CRT and covid-19 school closures in his bid for Virginia\u2019s governorship in 2021, debates over schooling have ignited conservatives. Savvy networking and organising made Moms for Liberty the new face of the cause: that one of the group\u2019s founders is married to the chairman of Florida\u2019s Republican Party no doubt helped woo Mr DeSantis, who is among the Moms\u2019 heftiest backers. Funding from conservative outfits like the Leadership Institute and the Heritage Foundation solidified it as a key part of the new-right machine. \nAs your correspondent waded through the Philadelphia hotel lobby where the Moms\u2019 annual summit took place\u2014the organisers refused to give her press credentials and cancelled scheduled interviews at the last minute\u2014a woman in a suit who claimed to be a detective approached and demanded to see her driver\u2019s licence and to know her street address. When asked why, the woman said she needed to check that your correspondent \u201cwasn\u2019t Antifa\u201d (a left-wing anti-fascist group and a bogeyman of the right). Some prodding confirmed that the woman was indeed a plain-clothes cop, who had voted for Mr Trump, found journalists dubious and believed that \u201cnot all Proud Boys are extremists\u201d, referring to an exclusively male white-nationalist group with a reputation for misogyny and a propensity for violence. \nMoms for Liberty ran a training session in Philadelphia titled \u201c(wo)manhandling the media\u201d, warning members that \u201cthe media is not [their] friend\u201d. That approach has helped it get its message to the masses. A new poll from The Economist/YouGov shows that 47% of Americans have an opinion of Moms for Liberty, whether favourable and unfavourable, which is not bad for an upstart social movement. \nThe movement might not be as electorally significant as that number suggests, though. An analysis by TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm, attributes Mr Youngkin\u2019s win not to anxious parents but to a \u201csilver surge\u201d in turnout among elderly Republican-leaning voters. A CBS News poll from 2022 found that 85% of Americans oppose banning books that contain political ideas they disagree with, and this past spring less than one-third of the school-board candidates Moms for Liberty endorsed won seats. \nWhipping up maternal fervour may help Republican politicians in the primaries. But come the general election in 2024, an allegiance to Moms for Liberty could become more of a liability. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only
