For 42 years the alliance prepared for conventional and nuclear war with the Soviet Union and its allies. In 1991 the Warsaw Pact fell apart and the plans fell into abeyance. Now Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine highlights the need for new strategies. \nOn July 11th and 12th leaders will gather in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, for NATO\u2019s annual summit. They are expected to approve the alliance\u2019s first comprehensive defence plans since the cold war. \u201cIt\u2019s the most dramatic change\u2026since the fall of the Berlin Wall,\u201d says Matthew Van Wagenen, an American general in the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). The question is whether the allies can live up to their ambition.\nThere is much to discuss in Vilnius. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, has just had his term extended for another year (the allies could not agree on a candidate to replace him). Ukraine wants an invitation to join the alliance after the war; in the meantime it expects detailed and substantial guarantees of long-term aid. A sticking-point will be Turkey\u2019s continued veto of Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO. Another will be the alliance\u2019s relationship with Asia. The allies agree that China is having an ever-larger impact on European security\u2014not least through its deepening relationship with Russia\u2014but a row over whether to open a NATO office in Tokyo reveals splits over how to respond. \nDespite all this, it is the planned overhaul of NATO\u2019s military machinery that is the most consequential item on the agenda. The architect of the defence reforms is Chris Cavoli, an American general who serves as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). His job was first held by Dwight Eisenhower\u2014whose globe still sits in General Cavoli\u2019s office in the Belgian city of Mons. General Cavoli, a Russian speaker educated at Princeton and Yale, is widely considered to be one of the most impressive officers of his generation. His plans run to 4,000 (classified) pages.\nThe centrepiece is a trio of regional plans: one for the north, covering the Atlantic and European Arctic; one for the centre, which addresses the Baltic and central Europe down to the Alps; and a southern plan for the Mediterranean and Black Sea. There are sub-plans for space, cyber operations and special forces. Russia, unsurprisingly, is the focus, but not exclusively so: the southern plan, on Turkey\u2019s insistence, splits its attention evenly between the threat from Russia and from terrorist groups. \nThe first and most important purpose of the documents is deterrence. \u201cThe key for NATO war plans has always been that Moscow knows there are NATO war plans,\u201d says Tim Sayle, a historian of the alliance at the University of Toronto.\nThat said, the plans also provide clear guidance for every armed force in Europe and North America about how to act should conflict erupt. \u201cAs a young sub-lieutenant, I knew precisely where my artillery battery was going to go\u2014which town,\u201d says General Darryl Williams, commander of the US Army in Europe, reflecting on his deployment to West Germany in 1983. \u201cWe look forward to a time here, very quickly, where we\u2019ll be able to get that kind of clarity again.\u201d Later this year, General Cavoli will allocate specific countries to specific roles or parts of the front. Battalions and brigades can get to know their patch in advance, whether that is a Norwegian island or a stretch of the Carpathians. \nMission accepted\nKnowing one\u2019s task is not the same as being able to carry it out, of course. Another hope is that the plans will prompt reform and increase accountability. During the cold war SHAPE had a large staff that could continually test how ready national forces were for combat. This team dwindled but is growing once more: \u201cSACEUR has now got a big stick to beat nations with,\u201d says a European official. At last year\u2019s NATO summit in Madrid the allies agreed they would collectively keep over 100,000 troops ready to deploy in less than ten days, and another 200,000 on a month\u2019s readiness\u2014a far larger number of high-readiness troops than before. Just as important is that allies will now \u201cdeclare\u201d to General Cavoli which units are available at any time. \nIn recent weeks America, Germany and Britain have all practised how they could quickly scale up their battalion-sized deployments in Poland, Lithuania and Estonia into brigade-sized formations. Italy will probably soon run a similar test in Bulgaria. The aim of this is to assure the Baltic states, and to demonstrate to Russia, that these armies are agile enough to reinforce NATO\u2019s eastern front more quickly than Russia can mobilise for an attack. This month Germany, whose armed forces have been in poor shape over the past decade, went further. It promised that it would eventually station a whole brigade on Lithuanian soil\u2014an unprecedented commitment. NATO exercises are also becoming more demanding: they are \u201cmore or less rehearsals\u201d, says one official. The largest in decades, Steadfast Jupiter, should take place later this year. \nNATO\u2019s new plans will not only keep armies on their toes, but also set priorities for procurement and investment. Collective defence of the continent requires heavy weaponry: jets, tanks and artillery. But for years following the attacks on September 11th, 2001 the allies were fighting guerrilla wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that demanded somewhat different kinds of kit: mine-resistant vehicles, transport helicopters and light infantry. NATO did not impose any discipline on what its members purchased: \u201cWe have had no requirements on the nations that have really been enforced over the last 30 years,\u201d says General Van Wagenen. The aim is now to bring demand and supply into line again through a mechanism known as the \u201cforce structure requirement\u201d\u2014essentially, General Cavoli\u2019s list of what is needed if his military strategy is to work as it is intended to do. \nA NATO bigwig points to five immediate priorities: combat-capable ground forces, particularly heavy armoured brigades; integrated air- and missile-defence systems capable of protecting units on the move; long-range firepower such as artillery and rocket launchers; digital networks that allow data to move around the battlefield and back to headquarters quickly and securely; and logistics to shunt large armies across Europe while keeping them adequately supplied. \nThis list largely reflects needs that have been identified while observing the war in Ukraine: old-fashioned artillery has inflicted the majority of casualties; manoeuvring without armour has proven extremely costly. The problem is that the majority of European armies fare woefully on most of these measures (notwithstanding pockets of excellence, such as Finland\u2019s artillery-rich army of conscripts). \nA paper published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a think-tank in London, concludes that the number of combat battalions in some of NATO\u2019s largest armies barely changed between 2015 and 2023, despite the growing threat from Russia. France and Germany have each added one battalion\u2019s worth of forces, a piddling amount, and even Poland has added only two. Britain has lost five over that period. \u201cMost\u2026nations now can only field one full-strength brigade,\u201d laments a senior NATO general\u2014a number that would dismay any cold-war general transplanted to the present. The same is true of naval forces. Commodore Carsten Fjord-Larsen of the Danish navy laments that in 2002 his navy fielded 34 combat units. The figure is now down to five. \nAmmunition holdings are a serious problem. Britain \u201chas probably not got a sufficient stockpile for a heavy armoured brigade to fight an intense war\u201d, says Ben Barry, a retired brigadier now at the IISS and a co-author of the report. In private, British generals agree. Ukraine\u2019s offensive compounds the problem: every ten days that country is chewing through as many shells as America produces in a month. Countries are having to choose between keeping Ukraine solvent and maintaining their own reserves. \nThe right kit\nThere are also other holes. NATO has around ten corps headquarters but most are lacking in artillery, air-defence and helicopter brigades to support the divisions under their command, says Mr Barry. \u201cThe corps commander hasn\u2019t got any troops he can use to shape the deep battle.\u201d  \nSuch calculations highlight Europe\u2019s dependency on America. The Pentagon puts others to shame by positioning 22 battalion-equivalents in Europe, mostly under V Corps in Poland. That is up from six in 2015; it is roughly the same number that Britain has in total. Will it last? \u201cThe inconvenient truth for Europe is that what\u2019s currently in V Corps reflects a lot of reinforcement that took place last year,\u201d says Mr Barry. \u201cBut the overall direction of travel of US deployments is away from Europe towards the Indo-Pacific.\u201d If a crisis were to erupt in Taiwan, Europe could find itself rather worryingly exposed.\nAnd yet the new plans also draw America and Europe closer in important ways. \u201cNot many people really get this,\u201d says the NATO bigwig, \u201cbut America is coming back into the NATO planning system in a big way.\u201d For the past 20 years, he says, the United States European Command (EUCOM) in Stuttgart in Germany\u2014America\u2019s military command for the continent\u2014largely kept to itself, scribbling defence plans at a time when European armed forces were doing little detailed planning of their own. NATO\u2019s new plans are aligned with American thinking. In many ways they are products of it (General Cavoli is commander of both EUCOM and NATO). That suggests America is plugging back in\u2014despite political jitters over the possible re-election of Donald Trump next year. \nBroader reforms being carried out on NATO\u2019s command structure exemplify similar dynamics. SHAPE\u2019s very headquarters is being transformed, says General Van Wagenen: the second floor has been \u201cgutted\u201d to put in a new operations centre. A new land command to handle NATO operations north of the Alps could have been hosted by Poland or Germany, both of which were interested in the job; instead the US Army is taking on that task itself. The new command will be in General Williams\u2019 headquarters in Wiesbaden. Paradoxically, given fears of American abandonment, some Europeans fret that American generals are taking over. \u201cYes,\u201d retorts the bigwig, \u201cthey\u2019re taking the lead because they intend to fight here: that\u2019s quite good news if you\u2019re European.\u201d \nOf maps and machinery\nThe new reforms are profoundly shaped by the way the alliance\u2019s membership has changed over the past 30 years. In 1989, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO\u2019s border with the Warsaw Pact was essentially the inner-German border\u20141,380km in length, almost all of it heavily militarised\u2014plus a small area in northern Norway. By 2004, when the Baltic states joined NATO, its border with Russia was only 800km long. But when Finland joined on April 4th this year, that more than doubled at a stroke (see map). General Cavoli\u2019s canvas stretches from the freezing cold of the Arctic to the baking heat of Anatolia.\n\nIn 1989 \u201ceverybody had fixed positions\u201d, says General Van Wagenen. Armies were larger, on both sides, and troops were packed densely along the front lines. Now smaller armies are stretched across a far larger front. \u201cYou have to have more agile forces,\u201d says the general. \u201cA new alert system aims to sharpen NATO\u2019s intelligence machinery, so that elements of its new plans can be activated swiftly in response to early signs of trouble, such as Russian troop movements. \nFinland\u2019s accession brings new opportunities, too. Its highly professional and well-equipped army, which can mobilise huge numbers of conscripts quickly, is likely to drive up standards in the alliance, says one official. Its membership \u201ctidies up that Nordic and Baltic geography very nicely,\u201d says another, with Russia\u2019s route out of the Gulf of Finland and into the Baltic Sea increasingly constrained by NATO states (more so if Sweden joins, too). \u201cIt poses far more challenges to Russia than to NATO,\u201d adds the official. In March American reconnaissance aircraft began flying over Finland, something that would have been outlandish 18 months ago. \n\nIf NATO has an ambitious agenda, the biggest question is how to afford it. \u201cWe are champions in announcing things,\u201d says a German NATO commander, \u201cnot in implementing.\u201d At a summit in Wales in 2014, following Russia\u2019s first invasion of Ukraine, allies promised to \u201cmove towards\u201d the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP by 2024. Only three allies met the target then. Now seven do (see chart). Germany will get there next year, France in 2025. But most lag far behind. In Vilnius the allies are expected to set a new defence-investment pledge. The 2% target may become a floor, rather than a target. Eastern allies\u2014such as Poland, which may spend a whopping 4% of its GDP on defence this year, and Estonia, which says it will get to 3%\u2014are keen on this. But raising the target would only highlight the chasm that already exists between hopes and reality.\nBen Wallace, Britain\u2019s defence secretary, says that some countries \u201creally don\u2019t want to do 2%\u201d\u2014Canada is the largest example\u2014and that others will peak at 2% without being able to sustain it. \u201cThere is some backsliding going on,\u201d he warns. \u201cIn real terms we [Europe] invest less in defence now than we did in 2021,\u201d complains Kusti Salm, the top civil servant in Estonia\u2019s defence ministry. NATO\u2019s new plans will give national army chiefs and defence ministers more leverage with finance ministers: failure to meet the spending target will no longer be just a source of embarrassment at each annual summit, liable to provoke a gentle dressing-down from Mr Stoltenberg, but may also leave a tangible hole in the continent\u2019s war plans. \u201cIt changes the entire discussion around defence spending,\u201d says Mr Sayle, \u201cor at least it did in the cold war.\u201d \nOne catch is that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while catalysing reforms, has also cast doubt on whether the threat it poses to NATO members is as great as was previously thought. Russia\u2019s armed forces have proved less capable than most experts and officials had expected. Its army has had perhaps 60,000 men killed, including many of the most professional men and officers. Huge amounts of equipment have been destroyed, including over 1,300 tanks. Some European generals reckon this takes the pressure off: they think it will take Russia a decade to reconstitute.\nThe bear and its wounds\nGeneral Cavoli frequently rebuts this idea.

boxer Mike Tyson was asked ahead of a fight whether he was concerned about an opponent\u2019s plan, he was blunt: \u201cEverybody has a plan \u2018til they get punched in the mouth.\u201d With NATO it has been the other way around. For 42 years the alliance prepared for conventional and nuclear war with the Soviet Union and its allies. In 1991 the Warsaw Pact fell apart and the plans fell into abeyance. Now Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine highlights the need for new strategies. \nOn July 11th and 12th leaders will gather in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, for NATO\u2019s annual summit. They are expected to approve the alliance\u2019s first comprehensive defence plans since the cold war. \u201cIt\u2019s the most dramatic change\u2026since the fall of the Berlin Wall,\u201d says Matthew Van Wagenen, an American general in the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). The question is whether the allies can live up to their ambition.\nThere is much to discuss in Vilnius. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, has just had his term extended for another year (the allies could not agree on a candidate to replace him). Ukraine wants an invitation to join the alliance after the war; in the meantime it expects detailed and substantial guarantees of long-term aid. A sticking-point will be Turkey\u2019s continued veto of Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO. Another will be the alliance\u2019s relationship with Asia. The allies agree that China is having an ever-larger impact on European security\u2014not least through its deepening relationship with Russia\u2014but a row over whether to open a NATO office in Tokyo reveals splits over how to respond. \nDespite all this, it is the planned overhaul of NATO\u2019s military machinery that is the most consequential item on the agenda. The architect of the defence reforms is Chris Cavoli, an American general who serves as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). His job was first held by Dwight Eisenhower\u2014whose globe still sits in General Cavoli\u2019s office in the Belgian city of Mons. General Cavoli, a Russian speaker educated at Princeton and Yale, is widely considered to be one of the most impressive officers of his generation. His plans run to 4,000 (classified) pages.\nThe centrepiece is a trio of regional plans: one for the north, covering the Atlantic and European Arctic; one for the centre, which addresses the Baltic and central Europe down to the Alps; and a southern plan for the Mediterranean and Black Sea. There are sub-plans for space, cyber operations and special forces. Russia, unsurprisingly, is the focus, but not exclusively so: the southern plan, on Turkey\u2019s insistence, splits its attention evenly between the threat from Russia and from terrorist groups. \nThe first and most important purpose of the documents is deterrence. \u201cThe key for NATO war plans has always been that Moscow knows there are NATO war plans,\u201d says Tim Sayle, a historian of the alliance at the University of Toronto.\nThat said, the plans also provide clear guidance for every armed force in Europe and North America about how to act should conflict erupt. \u201cAs a young sub-lieutenant, I knew precisely where my artillery battery was going to go\u2014which town,\u201d says General Darryl Williams, commander of the US Army in Europe, reflecting on his deployment to West Germany in 1983. \u201cWe look forward to a time here, very quickly, where we\u2019ll be able to get that kind of clarity again.\u201d Later this year, General Cavoli will allocate specific countries to specific roles or parts of the front. Battalions and brigades can get to know their patch in advance, whether that is a Norwegian island or a stretch of the Carpathians. \nMission accepted\nKnowing one\u2019s task is not the same as being able to carry it out, of course. Another hope is that the plans will prompt reform and increase accountability. During the cold war SHAPE had a large staff that could continually test how ready national forces were for combat. This team dwindled but is growing once more: \u201cSACEUR has now got a big stick to beat nations with,\u201d says a European official. At last year\u2019s NATO summit in Madrid the allies agreed they would collectively keep over 100,000 troops ready to deploy in less than ten days, and another 200,000 on a month\u2019s readiness\u2014a far larger number of high-readiness troops than before. Just as important is that allies will now \u201cdeclare\u201d to General Cavoli which units are available at any time. \nIn recent weeks America, Germany and Britain have all practised how they could quickly scale up their battalion-sized deployments in Poland, Lithuania and Estonia into brigade-sized formations. Italy will probably soon run a similar test in Bulgaria. The aim of this is to assure the Baltic states, and to demonstrate to Russia, that these armies are agile enough to reinforce NATO\u2019s eastern front more quickly than Russia can mobilise for an attack. This month Germany, whose armed forces have been in poor shape over the past decade, went further. It promised that it would eventually station a whole brigade on Lithuanian soil\u2014an unprecedented commitment. NATO exercises are also becoming more demanding: they are \u201cmore or less rehearsals\u201d, says one official. The largest in decades, Steadfast Jupiter, should take place later this year. \nNATO\u2019s new plans will not only keep armies on their toes, but also set priorities for procurement and investment. Collective defence of the continent requires heavy weaponry: jets, tanks and artillery. But for years following the attacks on September 11th, 2001 the allies were fighting guerrilla wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that demanded somewhat different kinds of kit: mine-resistant vehicles, transport helicopters and light infantry. NATO did not impose any discipline on what its members purchased: \u201cWe have had no requirements on the nations that have really been enforced over the last 30 years,\u201d says General Van Wagenen. The aim is now to bring demand and supply into line again through a mechanism known as the \u201cforce structure requirement\u201d\u2014essentially, General Cavoli\u2019s list of what is needed if his military strategy is to work as it is intended to do. \nA NATO bigwig points to five immediate priorities: combat-capable ground forces, particularly heavy armoured brigades; integrated air- and missile-defence systems capable of protecting units on the move; long-range firepower such as artillery and rocket launchers; digital networks that allow data to move around the battlefield and back to headquarters quickly and securely; and logistics to shunt large armies across Europe while keeping them adequately supplied. \nThis list largely reflects needs that have been identified while observing the war in Ukraine: old-fashioned artillery has inflicted the majority of casualties; manoeuvring without armour has proven extremely costly. The problem is that the majority of European armies fare woefully on most of these measures (notwithstanding pockets of excellence, such as Finland\u2019s artillery-rich army of conscripts). \nA paper published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a think-tank in London, concludes that the number of combat battalions in some of NATO\u2019s largest armies barely changed between 2015 and 2023, despite the growing threat from Russia. France and Germany have each added one battalion\u2019s worth of forces, a piddling amount, and even Poland has added only two. Britain has lost five over that period. \u201cMost\u2026nations now can only field one full-strength brigade,\u201d laments a senior NATO general\u2014a number that would dismay any cold-war general transplanted to the present. The same is true of naval forces. Commodore Carsten Fjord-Larsen of the Danish navy laments that in 2002 his navy fielded 34 combat units. The figure is now down to five. \nAmmunition holdings are a serious problem. Britain \u201chas probably not got a sufficient stockpile for a heavy armoured brigade to fight an intense war\u201d, says Ben Barry, a retired brigadier now at the IISS and a co-author of the report. In private, British generals agree. Ukraine\u2019s offensive compounds the problem: every ten days that country is chewing through as many shells as America produces in a month. Countries are having to choose between keeping Ukraine solvent and maintaining their own reserves. \nThe right kit\nThere are also other holes. NATO has around ten corps headquarters but most are lacking in artillery, air-defence and helicopter brigades to support the divisions under their command, says Mr Barry. \u201cThe corps commander hasn\u2019t got any troops he can use to shape the deep battle.\u201d  \nSuch calculations highlight Europe\u2019s dependency on America. The Pentagon puts others to shame by positioning 22 battalion-equivalents in Europe, mostly under V Corps in Poland. That is up from six in 2015; it is roughly the same number that Britain has in total. Will it last? \u201cThe inconvenient truth for Europe is that what\u2019s currently in V Corps reflects a lot of reinforcement that took place last year,\u201d says Mr Barry. \u201cBut the overall direction of travel of US deployments is away from Europe towards the Indo-Pacific.\u201d If a crisis were to erupt in Taiwan, Europe could find itself rather worryingly exposed.\nAnd yet the new plans also draw America and Europe closer in important ways. \u201cNot many people really get this,\u201d says the NATO bigwig, \u201cbut America is coming back into the NATO planning system in a big way.\u201d For the past 20 years, he says, the United States European Command (EUCOM) in Stuttgart in Germany\u2014America\u2019s military command for the continent\u2014largely kept to itself, scribbling defence plans at a time when European armed forces were doing little detailed planning of their own. NATO\u2019s new plans are aligned with American thinking. In many ways they are products of it (General Cavoli is commander of both EUCOM and NATO). That suggests America is plugging back in\u2014despite political jitters over the possible re-election of Donald Trump next year. \nBroader reforms being carried out on NATO\u2019s command structure exemplify similar dynamics. SHAPE\u2019s very headquarters is being transformed, says General Van Wagenen: the second floor has been \u201cgutted\u201d to put in a new operations centre. A new land command to handle NATO operations north of the Alps could have been hosted by Poland or Germany, both of which were interested in the job; instead the US Army is taking on that task itself. The new command will be in General Williams\u2019 headquarters in Wiesbaden. Paradoxically, given fears of American abandonment, some Europeans fret that American generals are taking over. \u201cYes,\u201d retorts the bigwig, \u201cthey\u2019re taking the lead because they intend to fight here: that\u2019s quite good news if you\u2019re European.\u201d \nOf maps and machinery\nThe new reforms are profoundly shaped by the way the alliance\u2019s membership has changed over the past 30 years. In 1989, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO\u2019s border with the Warsaw Pact was essentially the inner-German border\u20141,380km in length, almost all of it heavily militarised\u2014plus a small area in northern Norway. By 2004, when the Baltic states joined NATO, its border with Russia was only 800km long. But when Finland joined on April 4th this year, that more than doubled at a stroke (see map). General Cavoli\u2019s canvas stretches from the freezing cold of the Arctic to the baking heat of Anatolia.\n\nIn 1989 \u201ceverybody had fixed positions\u201d, says General Van Wagenen. Armies were larger, on both sides, and troops were packed densely along the front lines. Now smaller armies are stretched across a far larger front. \u201cYou have to have more agile forces,\u201d says the general. \u201cA new alert system aims to sharpen NATO\u2019s intelligence machinery, so that elements of its new plans can be activated swiftly in response to early signs of trouble, such as Russian troop movements. \nFinland\u2019s accession brings new opportunities, too. Its highly professional and well-equipped army, which can mobilise huge numbers of conscripts quickly, is likely to drive up standards in the alliance, says one official. Its membership \u201ctidies up that Nordic and Baltic geography very nicely,\u201d says another, with Russia\u2019s route out of the Gulf of Finland and into the Baltic Sea increasingly constrained by NATO states (more so if Sweden joins, too). \u201cIt poses far more challenges to Russia than to NATO,\u201d adds the official. In March American reconnaissance aircraft began flying over Finland, something that would have been outlandish 18 months ago. \n\nIf NATO has an ambitious agenda, the biggest question is how to afford it. \u201cWe are champions in announcing things,\u201d says a German NATO commander, \u201cnot in implementing.\u201d At a summit in Wales in 2014, following Russia\u2019s first invasion of Ukraine, allies promised to \u201cmove towards\u201d the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP by 2024. Only three allies met the target then. Now seven do (see chart). Germany will get there next year, France in 2025. But most lag far behind. In Vilnius the allies are expected to set a new defence-investment pledge. The 2% target may become a floor, rather than a target. Eastern allies\u2014such as Poland, which may spend a whopping 4% of its GDP on defence this year, and Estonia, which says it will get to 3%\u2014are keen on this. But raising the target would only highlight the chasm that already exists between hopes and reality.\nBen Wallace, Britain\u2019s defence secretary, says that some countries \u201creally don\u2019t want to do 2%\u201d\u2014Canada is the largest example\u2014and that others will peak at 2% without being able to sustain it. \u201cThere is some backsliding going on,\u201d he warns. \u201cIn real terms we [Europe] invest less in defence now than we did in 2021,\u201d complains Kusti Salm, the top civil servant in Estonia\u2019s defence ministry. NATO\u2019s new plans will give national army chiefs and defence ministers more leverage with finance ministers: failure to meet the spending target will no longer be just a source of embarrassment at each annual summit, liable to provoke a gentle dressing-down from Mr Stoltenberg, but may also leave a tangible hole in the continent\u2019s war plans. \u201cIt changes the entire discussion around defence spending,\u201d says Mr Sayle, \u201cor at least it did in the cold war.\u201d \nOne catch is that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while catalysing reforms, has also cast doubt on whether the threat it poses to NATO members is as great as was previously thought. Russia\u2019s armed forces have proved less capable than most experts and officials had expected. Its army has had perhaps 60,000 men killed, including many of the most professional men and officers. Huge amounts of equipment have been destroyed, including over 1,300 tanks. Some European generals reckon this takes the pressure off: they think it will take Russia a decade to reconstitute.\nThe bear and its wounds\nGeneral Cavoli frequently rebuts this idea. In April he told America\u2019s Congress that the Russian army, though \u201cdegenerated somewhat\u201d, was larger than at the outset of war. Russia\u2019s air force was largely intact, he said, with over 1,000 fighters and bombers, as was the navy. Russia\u2019s submarine force remains a particular concern. This is not simply an American view. Russia is developing \u201cfrightening underwater capabilities\u201d, warns a German naval officer, pointing to threats to undersea infrastructure such as pipelines and cables. \u201cThey are way ahead of NATO in this.\u201d An Estonian field commander notes that, at every level of command, \u201cRussian officers are gaining experience we don\u2019t have.\u201d \nNATO\u2019s own assessments suggest that Russia could rebuild its forces in as little as three to seven years. That is less time than it will take to recapitalise and re-equip Europe\u2019s hollowed-out armed forces; to rebuild defence industries capable of meeting wartime demand for shells and weapons; and to revive cold-war military skills such as river crossings and division-level command. Eastern allies are not inclined to assume that Russia will dally. And Ukraine\u2019s future is far from assured; its counter-offensive has so far proceeded more slowly than planned. \u201cThis month in 2023\u201d, says Mr Salm, \u201cis the most decisive moment for our generation.\u201d \u25a0\nStay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "description": "They look set to be approved at a crucial summit this month", "ogDescription": "They look set to be approved at a crucial summit this month", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230708_IRP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-07-02T17:28:07Z", "dateModified": "2023-07-06T11:54:58Z", "dateCreated": "2023-07-02T17:27:43Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-07-08T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "BRUSSELS", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/st2rjm3qln4crfirlup1rt33thlvsoel", "publication": [{"id": "/content/6mah1kargo14n1cfpjumg0b0s9h1n692", "context": {"position": 1300.53, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/265fprsj78lb7vumd51siihnmrtfs5io", "context": {"position": 1300.53, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/oq6lg70nuoc2lgvab633ipr370gpfn88", "context": {"position": 1300.53, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4oo5nku0div1v9tohmnj8t1j74lm4mnv", "context": {"position": 1300.53, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/c5sk0oqfo14e5cc6idam5tgo9i86172e", "context": {"position": 1300.53, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/1i2d106p7ga83vvlmbhlbcvdfg8cebeq", "context": {"position": 1300.53, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/979jji5a4d2q1kflupdii9t55ls9iu7s", "context": {"position": 1300.53, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4d5qgurnjm4kmr334eip06gk7mi0v4t0", "context": {"position": 1300.53, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "NATO is drafting new plans to defend Europe", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/02/nato-is-drafting-new-plans-to-defend-europe", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
