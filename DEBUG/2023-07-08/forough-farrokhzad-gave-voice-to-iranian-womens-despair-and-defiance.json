"url": "https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/06/forough-farrokhzad-gave-voice-to-iranian-womens-despair-and-defiance", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Women\u2019s liberty is at the forefront of Iranian politics. In September Mahsa Amini was arrested for not wearing her hijab correctly and died in police custody; for weeks people occupied the streets and chanted \u201cwomen, life, freedom.\u201d The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the regime\u2019s praetorian guard, has clamped down on the protests and arrested tens of thousands of people. Some police officers have continued to threaten women who do not cover their hair and have erected billboards stating that those forgoing the hijab are dishonouring their families. \nThe struggle for female emancipation was powerfully articulated by Forough Farrokhzad, a 20th-century poet. She was born into a strict military family in Tehran in 1934; at the age of 16 she married a distant, much older relative and had a son. In 1954 the couple divorced and, in accordance with the law at that time, she lost custody of the child. Farrokhzad released her first collection of poetry, \u201cAsir\u201d (\u201cThe Captive\u201d), the following year.\nHer work offered provocative explorations of lust; the verses are shot through with religious language. \u201cWeary of divine asceticism,\u201d she wrote, \u201cin the middle of the night in Satan\u2019s bed/I\u2019d seek refuge in the slopes of a fresh sin.\u201d Elsewhere sex and artistic inspiration are entwined: \u201cYou kindled my passionate desire/Thus setting my poems afire.\u201d\nFarrokhzad saw that the repression of women was having a stultifying effect. Poets such as Rumi had imagined Persia as a thriving garden, yet she saw her country as \u201cdying\u201d and \u201cwaiting for rain\u201d. In her final and most widely read collection, \u201cTavalodi Digar\u201d (\u201cAnother Birth\u201d, 1964), a blistering poem attacked self-satisfied elites who \u201csuckle on our past glory\u201d.\nShe released only four collections of poetry during her short life: she died in 1967, aged 32, in a car accident. Her work was potent enough to cause consternation more than a decade later, during the Islamic revolution of 1979. Religious clerics banned the dissemination of her poetry and, when Farrokhzad\u2019s publisher refused to stop, he was thrown in jail. \nIranian artists have continued to evoke her verse when drawing attention to the oppression of women. For one photographic series called \u201cWomen of Allah\u201d (1994), Shirin Neshat wrote lines from the poems on her subjects. In 2002 \u201cThe Green Cold\u201d, a documentary about Farrokhzad\u2019s life by Nasser Saffarian, was screened to sold-out audiences for three weeks before it was banned. In 2009, during the presidential-election protests, women etched lines from her poetry on placards when they took to the streets.\nLast year New Directions, an American publisher, released a fresh translation of her selected poems. (They are also available online.) Her work is still read widely in Iran as old editions are sold on the black market. Farrokhzad remains a symbol of defiance. \u201cOnly you, O Iranian woman, have remained/In bonds of wretchedness, misfortune, and cruelty;/If you want these bonds broken,/grasp the skirt of obstinacy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTake action because a world/awaits and is in tune with you.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot
