long reflected the city\u2019s ambitions. Thanks to its proximity to the River Irwell, the site became a hub for the booming cotton and timber trades during the Industrial Revolution. After the second world war, as the city\u2019s economy turned towards services, Britain\u2019s first purpose-built television studios were set up there. (Most of the studios were closed or relocated in 2013.) Now the area is undergoing yet another transformation. On June 30th a multi-use arts venue on the banks of the river\u2014costing \u00a3211m ($268m) and spanning more than 140,000 square feet\u2014welcomed its first visitors. \nThe building, initially called Factory International but recently rebranded as Aviva Studios, was announced in 2014 by George Osborne, then the chancellor of the exchequer. It is mostly funded by the government and Manchester City Council and is the biggest investment in a cultural project in Britain since Tate Modern in 2000. \nMr Osborne saw Factory International as part of his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d policy, which aimed to boost the economies of places such as Manchester and Newcastle, and to shift jobs, investment and influence away from the south-east of England. According to recent data from the Office for National Statistics, London\u2019s gross value added (gva, a measure of output) is around 10% higher than the total of 11 other \u201ccore\u201d cities, including Manchester. Mr Osborne has since left politics\u2014he is now chairman of the British Museum\u2014but talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d continues. \nThe venue was designed by Ellen van Loon of OMA, an esteemed architecture firm, and its fa\u00e7ade evokes Manchester\u2019s mishmash of period buildings. Inside, a vast warehouse space can be configured in various ways; thanks to high-tech acoustic walls, different events can take place simultaneously. It will be the permanent home of the Manchester International Festival, a biennial event founded in 2007. \nThe venue can host enormous installations. The inaugural exhibition, \u201cYou, Me and the Balloons\u201d, is the largest-ever show by Yayoi Kusama, a blockbuster Japanese artist (see picture). For the full launch in October, Danny Boyle, a Mancunian film-maker, has created an immersive production inspired by \u201cThe Matrix\u201d.\nAviva Studios\u2019s aims are grandiose, too: executives say it will contribute \u00a31.1bn in gva in the next decade and directly and indirectly create more than 1,500 jobs. The Factory Academy, established in 2018, provides people with the technical skills needed by the venue and by the arts sector at large. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve built a really exciting international arts venue that people across the world will travel to see,\u201d says Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council, but \u201cthat\u2019s only half the story...It\u2019s purposeful growth, not just any old growth.\u201d \nManchester is not alone in betting on culture as a catalyst of regeneration. In America, Jersey City hopes to become a \u201cdestination for the arts\u201d and is footing the bill for Centre Pompidou\u2019s first North American outpost, due to open in 2026. In 2021 Abu Dhabi confirmed it would spend $6bn on its creative industries over five years in an attempt to diversify from oil; Muhammad bin Salman hopes to turn Al Ula into Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital of culture. China has opened scores of new museums in recent years, as has South Korea. \nIn January the Australian government launched \u201cRevive\u201d, a plan for the culture sector. Adrian Collette, the chief executive of Creative Australia, says that funding will be distributed across \u201cregional and remote communities\u201d and help turn the country into a knowledge economy rather than one based on \u201cextraction\u201d. (Mining remains one of its biggest industries.)\nThe idea of state support for culture can be a controversial one, as the well-off are most likely to participate in the arts; detractors would often rather see the money spent on hospitals or schools. Yet evidence suggests that a vibrant culture scene brings several benefits. Research by Centre for Cities, a think-tank, found that proximity to recreation facilities is important to 25- to 34-year-olds and influences their decisions about where to live. \nCulture has an impact on well-being, too. Researchers at University College London analysed a series of longitudinal studies conducted between 2017 and 2022 in America and Britain. Controlling for income, education and other demographic factors, they found that enjoying the arts was good for your health. Whether you are reading a book or going to the opera, you are guarding against depression, dementia and chronic pain. \nIn the 19th century, as Americans and Europeans moved to the city, governments built public institutions to enrich people\u2019s lives. Some economists have long sensed that this kind of investment can pay dividends. In Britain the Arts Council was established in the wake of the second world war to distribute government money across England, Scotland and Wales. John Maynard Keynes, a lover of opera and ballet, was its first chairman. \u201cAt last the public exchequer has recognised the support and encouragement of the civilising arts of life as a part of their duty,\u201d he said. \nDavid Throsby, a professor of economics at Macquarie University in Sydney, says that wonks started to define and quantify culture\u2019s impact on the economy in the late 1990s. The British government set up a Creative Industries Task Force in 1997. \nThe economic value of such institutions was further underscored by the success of Guggenheim Bilbao, also inaugurated in 1997. The Spanish city was undergoing structural change, says Juan Ignacio Vidarte, the museum\u2019s director. Steel and shipbuilding, historically a large part of the city\u2019s economy, was in decline; unemployment was high. The local government paid the $100m cost of the building, designed by Frank Gehry. That decision attracted opprobrium, but authorities recognised that the venue \u201cwas important for defining the future prospects of the city\u201d. \nThe risk paid off. Last year the museum attracted 1.3m visitors, two-thirds coming from outside Spain; Mr Vidarte says that visitors\u2019 spending in Bilbao raised more than \u20ac70m ($76m) in taxes for the regional government. The regeneration of the city, spearheaded by the Guggenheim, has been dubbed the \u201cBilbao effect\u201d. \nThe wrong conclusions are sometimes drawn from the project, Mr Vidarte warns. The museum did not reverse the city\u2019s fortunes single-handedly: just as important was the investment in transport infrastructure and the cleaning up of the Nervi\u00f3n river (on which the museum sits.) It is not enough to commission an architect to design \u201ca flamboyant building and think that\u2019s going to be the magic wand to turn everything from dust to diamonds,\u201d Mr Vidarte says. \u201cThat\u2019s so naive.\u201d \nAll that glitters\nA multitude of factors make a city appealing to tourists as well as migrants. Economist Intelligence Unit, a sister company of The Economist, calculates a city\u2019s \u201cliveability\u201d according to five broad categories: culture and environment, education and infrastructure, health care and stability. Abu Dhabi welcomed an outpost of the Louvre in 2017; in recent years, its score has risen thanks to improvements in public services. Yet it still ranks only slightly above the average rating globally. \nThe authorities in Manchester know there is no single formula for growth. In 2022 it was announced the city would receive \u00a31bn to improve its public-transport system; it is also focusing on attracting technology companies and startups. A wide cultural ecosystem has been established over the past 25 years, with Media City, a BBC outpost, the National Football Museum and HOME, an arts complex.\n\u201cThis building is a manifestation of Manchester investing in creative industries as part of its future,\u201d says John McGrath, the artistic director and chief executive of Factory International (the moniker was retained for the organisation that runs Aviva Studios and the arts festival.) That name hints at the city\u2019s particular cultural heritage: between 1978 and 1992 Factory Records, a music label, championed bands including Happy Mondays, Joy Division and New Order. \nAt the same time, it emphasises the focus on economic output. St John\u2019s has a long history of manufacturing and exporting goods around the world. That continues\u2014only now, as Mr McGrath says, \u201cWe\u2019re building a factory for artists.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter", "description": "Countries around the world are investing in new artistic institutions.
