["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2023/07/06/business", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Meta unveiled Threads, a text-based conversation app that it is promoting as a more \u201cfriendly\u201d social-media rival to Twitter. Threads is linked to Instagram, one of Meta\u2019s existing social-networking sites, allowing its young base of users to switch easily between the two. With Twitter becoming ever more erratic under Elon Musk\u2019s stewardship, Threads could be an existential threat to the platform. Some 10m people signed up to Threads in the first seven hours, according to Meta. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s stockmarket valuation closed above $3trn for the first time. The company\u2019s share price has risen by nearly 50% this year, as investors bet on dizzy growth in iPhone revenues. Tech stocks in general have rallied after last year\u2019s rout. The NASDAQ composite has gained 32% since the start of 2023, its best first-half of a year since 1983. A handful of companies are driving the rally, notably Nvidia, which makes chips for use in artificial intelligence. Its stock is up by almost 200% this year. \nTesla\u2019s share price is also soaring. The maker of electric cars delivered 466,000 vehicles between April and June, up by 83% from the same three months last year and a company record, and produced 480,000. Underlining the phenomenal demand for electric vehicles BYD, a Chinese rival to Tesla, sold 700,000 electric and plug-in hybrids in its most recent quarter, its best ever for sales. \nAlef Aeronautics, a startup backed by a VC investor in Tesla and Space X, received an airworthiness certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration for its Model A flying car, the first time such a vehicle has obtained US government approval to fly. Alef aims to start selling its fully electric car, which can take off and land vertically as well as drive on roads, by the end of 2025. \nPolitical bias\nA federal judge in America imposed a temporary injunction on government officials talking to social-media companies about removing content that comes under the purview of free speech (not including criminal or terrorist themes). The case, which has not been finally resolved, was brought by the states of Louisiana and Missouri. The judge, who was appointed by Donald Trump, said it was \u201ctelling\u201d that it was mostly conservative views that the government sought to scrub from social platforms. \nPakistan\u2019s KSE 100 stockmarket registered its biggest gain in 15 years, after the government secured a $3bn short-term bail-out from the IMF. The deal gives Pakistan breathing room as it tries to avoid defaulting on debt repayments. Its foreign reserves have dwindled, leaving some businesses unable to pay for imports.  \nChina slapped export curbs on gallium and germanium, materials that are used to manufacture semiconductors. The decision was taken on grounds of national security but is seen as retaliation for Western sanctions on Chinese technology. The restrictions were announced shortly before Janet Yellen, America\u2019s treasury secretary, was due to visit China for talks. \nPan Gongsheng was named the new political chief of China\u2019s central bank, and is expected to soon take over the job of governor. Mr Pan, a former senior fellow at Harvard, has been a deputy governor since 2012 and was in charge of managing the country\u2019s vast foreign-currency reserves. Observers think it unlikely that he will change the bank\u2019s cautious approach to economic stimulus, at least for now. \nAustralia\u2019s central bank left its benchmark interest rate on hold at 4.1%, which surprised some economists. The bank raised the cash rate in June and sent out hawkish signals about further increases. At this week\u2019s meeting the rate-setters suggested that they wanted to evaluate the effect of previous increases, but didn\u2019t rule out more tightening in the future. \nSaudi Arabia and Russia took additional steps to lower oil supplies in the hope of boosting prices. The Saudis are extending a cut of 1m barrels a day until the end of August and the Russians are making an additional \u201cvoluntary\u201d reduction of 500,000 b/d. Prices didn\u2019t rise much in response. Brent crude has been trading around $72 to $76 a barrel since early May. \nIn India Reliance Jio, part of the Reliance conglomerate run by Mukesh Ambani, the richest man in Asia, launched a basic internet-connected phone for 999 rupees ($12). The cheap \u201cfeature\u201d device will lower the cost of a 4G phone for the 250m Indians who still use 2G, enabling them to tap mobile-payment services. \nThe fashion for travel\nTravellers to Japan may never again have to worry about packing a business suit or cocktail dress. Japan Airlines has rolled out a new service whereby passengers can rent clothes from the airline before they board via an app. The sets of clothing will cost up to \u00a57,000 ($49). Unfortunately for bigger customers, the clothes come mostly in only small, medium and large.", "description": "", "ogDescription": "", "imageUrl":
