"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/05/why-hong-kong-is-criminalising-a-song", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "ON JULY 5TH Cheng Wing-chun, a 27-year-old Hong Konger, became the first person in the territory to be convicted of insulting China\u2019s national anthem. Mr Cheng posted a 94-second video to YouTube of a local athlete receiving a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, in which he substituted \u201cMarch of the Volunteers\u201d, China\u2019s national anthem, with \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d, a popular pro-democracy anthem. His conviction is a sign of things to come: Hong Kong\u2019s government wants to silence the song for good. A civil injunction, filed by the territory\u2019s Department of Justice (DoJ) in June, is pending. If it is granted\u2014 which it probably will be\u2014the melody, lyrics and any adaptations of \u201cGlory\u201d will be banned; disseminating it will become illegal. Even whistling the tune could get Hong Kongers in trouble. Why are Hong Kong\u2019s authorities clamping down on \u201cGlory\u201d now\u2014and what will be the implications of the ban?\nThe catalyst was a series of gaffes. In March officials at the Ice Hockey World Championship in Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2014who had searched for \u201cHong Kong national anthem\u201d online\u2014mistakenly played the catchy Cantonese tune instead of China\u2019s anthem. It was the fifth such blunder at an international event in the past year. Hong Kong\u2019s government demanded that Google demote \u201cGlory\u201d in its search results. But the tech giant refused, saying that there was no evidence that the song was illegal. The DoJ is now attempting to force its hand.  \nThe ban would be the latest blow to freedom in Hong Kong. Since the national-security law was passed in June 2020, protest, free speech and local independent media have been smothered. Authorities show no sign of loosening their grip. On June 4th, more than 20 people suspected of commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 were detained. On July 3rd the government offered a bounty of HK$1m ($128,000) for information leading to the arrest of any of eight pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers now thought to be residing in America, Australia and Britain. (Their adopted countries are unlikely to give them up.)  People have been arrested for trivial acts, such as carrying a mobile phone with a sticker of a forbidden slogan or owning \u201cseditious\u201d children\u2019s cartoons. Using the national-security law to lock people up over a song is further proof of the government\u2019s thin-skinned insecurity. \nAll this is worrying for the international businesses that Hong Kong has attempted to woo back since the end of the territory\u2019s covid-19 lockdown. The plan to ban \u201cGlory\u201d puts tech firms who host it on their platforms in a tight spot. Hong Kong\u2019s national-security law asserts jurisdiction over anyone in any country\u2014of any nationality\u2014deemed to have broken the law even if they have never visited the territory. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, said that between July 2020 and June 2022 it had been forced to remove content globally on 50 occasions because of Hong Kong\u2019s laws.\nA DoJ representative said the injunction against \u201cGlory\u201d would target those who were trying to incite secession or sedition, or to violate the national-security law, rather than the \u201cworld at large\u201d. But the writ cites 32 YouTube links that could be deemed \u201cseditious\u201d. If it is granted, tech giants will be forced to choose between global censorship of the song\u2014opening them up to criticism from the West\u2014or exposing their offices and employees in Hong Kong to raids, or even arrests. The anthem\u2014which briefly topped local charts after the writ was filed\u2014has already disappeared from Apple Music and Spotify.
