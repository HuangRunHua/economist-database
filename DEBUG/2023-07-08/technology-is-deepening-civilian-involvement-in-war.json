Sedniv, a small town in Chernihiv province, north of Kyiv. \u201cThe locals called us,\u201d says Major-General Viktor Nikolyuk, commander of Ukrainian forces in the north, \u201cand said: what should we do?\u201d His answer was simple: \u201cDrain them.\u201d Locals on horses and tractors, carrying bottles, barrels and teapots, siphoned off fuel with the cry of Slava Ukraini\u2014glory to Ukraine. The general could hardly believe it when another round of tankers appeared shortly afterwards. Those, too, were relieved of their cargo.\nSmall wars are fought by a country\u2019s armed forces. Total wars are waged by entire nations. Civilians have played a huge role in the defence of Ukraine. When Ukrposhta, Ukraine\u2019s national postal agency, held a competition to design a stamp, the winning entry depicted a tractor towing away a captured Russian tank\u2014one of the war\u2019s most iconic images. When Kyiv was under threat, civilians mixed Molotov cocktails to hurl at invading armoured vehicles. Volunteers have raised money for vehicles and drones. The Serhiy Prytula Foundation, a civilian charity, even bought a satellite for the army. \u201cKyiv has placed cross-society resistance at the heart of its national defence,\u201d writes Hanna Shelest of Ukrainian Prism, a think-tank. \nNot uncommonly for total wars, the civilian-military distinction has broken down. \u201cA huge role was played by the local population,\u201d says General Nikolyuk. Locals hid mobile phones from Russian troops and revealed the location of their equipment by dropping virtual pins on Google Maps (a dedicated government app, eVorog, now offers a way for civilians to pass on intelligence). Colonel Oleh Shevchuk, commander of Ukraine\u2019s 43rd artillery brigade, and Serhiy Ogerenko, his chief of staff, speaking to Ukrainska Pravda, a newspaper, say civilians helped correct artillery fire, even using their own commercial drones. \n\nColonel Shevchuk says that, if his men knew that Russians were near a particular village but were unsure precisely where, they would open Google Maps, find a local shop and cold-call it. \u201cGood evening, we are from Ukraine! Do you have any kaptsaps [Russians] about? Yes. Where? Where? Behind Grandma Hanna\u2019s house. Which house is that? Well, everyone knows her! So you talk to people a little bit and work out where everything is.\u201d On one occasion, he says, a petrol-station owner offered the password to its surveillance camera, giving the army a live view of a Chechen column heading for Kyiv.\nDigitally enabled popular resistance on this scale would have been largely impossible 15 years ago. Jack McDonald of King\u2019s College London points out that, when America invaded Afghanistan in 2001, less than 1% of the local population had access to the internet. In Syria in 2011, when a civil war was already under way and mobile-phone footage of combat became widespread, the rate was still only 22%. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 it had reached 46%. When it did it again last year the figure had shot up to almost 80%. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in Ukraine,\u201d he says, \u201cis what\u2019s going to be standard.\u201d\nThis connectivity and the proliferation of smartphones that rely on it has accelerated and transformed an older form of civilian-military collaboration, familiar from the resistance networks of occupied France in the second world war. For some time, says General Sir Jim Hockenhull, Britain\u2019s chief of defence intelligence at the outset of the invasion, armies tried to make every soldier and platform a sensor. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is that so many people have become sensors.\u201d The result, he says, is a crowd-sourced \u201ccivilian sensor network\u201d that has proved \u201creally, really important\u201d. \nDigitally enabled popular resistance on this scale would have been impossible 15 years agoThe civilian network is not just for sensing. On February 26th, two days into the war, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine\u2019s deputy minister, publicly appealed to volunteers to conduct cyber-attacks against Russian businesses and government departments. The result was the IT Army of Ukraine, a group of nearly 200,000 volunteer hackers. Mr Fedorov asked hackers to target Russian state agencies, state-owned firms and banks. \nCivilian involvement extends beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders. By providing connectivity through its Starlink satellites, SpaceX has become an integral part of the Ukrainian army\u2019s kill chain. Satellites operated by ICEYE, a Finnish firm, provide detailed radar images of Russian military positions. Ukraine\u2019s Delta app, essentially a live map which fuses military intelligence from different sources, is hosted on cloud servers abroad, points out Keir Giles of Chatham House, a think-tank.\nWho is fighting whom?\nThis growing \u201ccivilianisation of the digital battlefield\u201d, as Kubo Macak, a legal adviser at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), calls it, has legal consequences. ICEYE satellites may be legitimate military objectives, legal experts say. Since Delta is facilitating combat operations, Russia would consider its cloud servers abroad to be \u201cvaluable targets\u201d, suggests Mr Giles. The IT Army\u2019s activities have prompted serious misgivings among scholars of international law and cyberspace. \nA core principle of international humanitarian law is that armed forces must discriminate between combatants and non-combatants. But if civilians are building drones, hauling military gear over the border from Poland, reporting on troop movements through apps and correcting artillery fire over video chat, do they become legitimate military targets?  The Geneva Conventions lay down that civilians lose protection \u201cfor such time as they take a direct part in hostilities\u201d. But what this means is hotly disputed.\nThe ICRC says direct participation must involve actions that deliberately affect military operations in favour of one side. That is a high bar. Experts agree that civilians who just answer questions do not meet the threshold. Colonel Shevchuk\u2019s phone calls would not automatically implicate those who pick up. Moreover, most intelligence passed on by apps is \u201ctoo general or insignificant to meet the threshold of harm criterion,\u201d argues Mr Macak. A civilian would have to gather and transmit information \u201cas part of a co-ordinated operation for the purposes of a specific attack\u201d. But flying a drone to correct shellfire would surely qualify. \nOne lesson is that connectivity is increasingly a vital military resource. The Taliban long ago tore down mobile-phone towers to stop Afghan villagers sending tip-offs to security forces. Mexican drug cartels now use signal-jamming equipment. General Nikolyuk says that civilian assistance was less forthcoming in Kharkiv and Donetsk in the east because Russia had disrupted mobile-phone networks in those areas.\nAll this presupposes that armies are making good-faith efforts to discriminate between civilians and soldiers\u2014that they care about the laws of war. If Ukrainian civilians have so often been willing to jeopardise their status as non-combatants, it may be because Russia\u2019s army has shown scant regard for such niceties. General Nikolyuk recalls Russian troops establishing a headquarters in a school in Yahidne, a village south of Chernihiv. Hundreds of locals were imprisoned in the basement. On another occasion in nearby Lukashivka, he says Russian soldiers, spotting a Ukrainian drone, forced women and children to walk down the street as human shields. \u201cWhat do you do in such cases? You bite your fists with impotence and that\u2019s it.\u201d\u25a0", "description": "Another chapter in our special report on the future of warfare considers the big legal questions raised by the
