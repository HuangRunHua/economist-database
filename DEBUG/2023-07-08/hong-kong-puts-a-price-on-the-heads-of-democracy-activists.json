Hong Kong on July 1st 2020\u2014the 23rd anniversary of its handover from Britain\u2014one gleeful official called it a \u201cbirthday present\u201d. Days after this year\u2019s anniversary came another surprise. On July 3rd Hong Kong police offered a reward of HK$1m ($128,000) for information leading to the arrest of any of eight pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers who had fled to the West.\nThe eight are accused of various offences under the security law, including inciting secession and colluding with foreign powers. They are now thought to be living in America, Australia and Britain. At least one, Nathan Law in Britain (pictured), has been granted asylum. Another, Kevin Yam, is an Australian citizen. \nMost have proved pesky critics of the government while they have been in exile. Steve Li, the police superintendent who unveiled the bounty scheme, noted that some had called for sanctions on Hong Kong. Such campaigning may be legal in the countries the activists now call home, but one of the many controversial aspects of the national-security law is its extra-territoriality. Hong Kong claims the right to prosecute not only those who are charged within its own territory, but also anybody in any country\u2014of any nationality\u2014it deems to have broken its security law.\nThose with a bounty on their head may not feel in particularly fresh peril. Mr Yam says, \u201cI will live my life as I always do.\u201d Anna Kwok, who runs a non-profit in America called the Hong Kong Democracy Council, told The Economist that she and her fellow exiles already avoid places that have extradition treaties with Hong Kong or China. After hearing that her name was on the list, Ms Kwok reiterated her demand that John Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, be barred from attending the summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation, or APEC, to be held in San Francisco in November.\n\nThe activists\u2019 adopted countries show no signs of forsaking them. America, Australia and Britain condemned Hong Kong\u2019s move and expressed their support for free speech. Even Mr Li seemed unconvinced about the prospects of his scheme. \u201cIf they don\u2019t return, we won\u2019t be able to arrest them, that\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said, though he insisted the offer of a reward might prove useful if they ever try to sneak back into Hong Kong. Mr Lee appealed, rather desperately, for the absconders to \u201chand themselves in as soon as possible\u201d.\nThe furore comes at a time when Hong Kong is trying to rehabilitate its global reputation. After a brutal 2022, when harsh covid restrictions contributed to a recession and prompted an exodus of residents, the government is trying to woo back tourists and businesses. In April it launched a campaign called \u201cHappy Hong Kong\u201d. Given that effort, and the likely ineffectiveness of the bounties, many observers are wondering why the government is targeting the activists in such a way.\nIt\u2019s performative \u201cmoustache twirling\u201d, says Alvin Cheung of Queen\u2019s University Faculty of Law in Canada. Hong Kong\u2019s government is exasperated with Western criticism of the security law, under which more than 260 people have been arrested, including four on July 5th for allegedly supporting people overseas who \u201cendanger national security\u201d. Last month members of the European Parliament called for sanctions on Hong Kong officials over the \u201cdeterioration of fundamental freedoms\u201d in the city. Britain has accepted nearly 150,000 visa applications from Hong Kongers under a special scheme since the security law was introduced. \nThe bounties, then, may be seen as a peacockish riposte to the West\u2014and a public demonstration of Hong Kong\u2019s fealty to the government in Beijing. They also serve to highlight the nature of Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cdual state\u201d, says Mr Cheung. On one level the bureaucracy and judiciary abide by a legal system that is well codified and equitably administered. But, he says, there is now a second, overarching \u201cprerogative state\u201d that operates with few legal restraints. That is handy for keeping troublemakers in check. For international types who once favoured Hong Kong for its stability and rule of law, it is a worry. \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the
