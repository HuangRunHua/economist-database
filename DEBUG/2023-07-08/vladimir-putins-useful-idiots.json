Next-door Austria has, more quietly but equally profitably, largely sat out the struggle, too, citing its non-membership of NATO and self-appointed role as a bridge between East and West, offering little aid to Ukraine even as its trade with Russia has surged. \nGreece, another EU member, is complying with the EU\u2019s sanctions, but has balked at tightening any further those on shipping Russian oil, perhaps because Greek firms happen to pocket so much from the trade. Only recently and under heavy American pressure did Cyprus, an offshore financial haven, shut down some 4,000 local bank accounts held by Russians. Facing less pressure, non-EU countries such as Turkey and Serbia don\u2019t even bother to disguise the lucrative back-door service they provide to Russia. \nSome countries have twisted seemingly noble intentions into policies that warm Mr Putin\u2019s heart. Citing its vaunted neutrality, Switzerland has wielded arcane local laws to block the supply of arms to Ukraine, including 96 mothballed Leopard tanks sitting in Italy that happen to belong to a private Swiss firm. Scoring repeated own goals with freedom-of-speech principles, police in Sweden have permitted public burnings of the Koran. This has hugely irked Muslim-majority Turkey, which wields a veto over Sweden\u2019s bid to join NATO. And Mr Putin has gleefully trolled the Swedes. On a trip to Dagestan before the Eid holiday at the end of June, he had himself filmed tenderly holding a Koran, as he explained that under Russian law it is a crime to desecrate holy things.    \nYet even solid-looking bricks in the would-be European wall of support for Ukraine can crumble. Slovakia, for instance, has been a vital conduit for Western aid and recently pledged its fleet of 13 Soviet-era Mig-29 fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force. But polls show that the party of Robert Fico, a Russophile leftist who has blamed \u201cUkrainian fascists\u201d for provoking Mr Putin, looks likely to win national elections scheduled for September.\nFrance is a linchpin of both NATO and the EU. But a French parliamentary panel recently scolded Marine Le Pen, the closest challenger to President Emmanuel Macron in last year\u2019s election, for parroting Russian propaganda following its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Ms Le Pen strenuously denies that her defence of Mr Putin had anything to do with the \u20ac9m in loans her party received that year from Russian-controlled banks. She has condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but last October, seven months into the war, she declared that sanctions on Russia were not working. \nIn Italy, although the hard-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, is a strong supporter of Ukraine, Matteo Salvini, who leads the second-biggest party in her coalition, is another opponent of sanctions and, at least up until the invasion, was a declared fan of Mr Putin\u2019s.\nGermany, like France, seems a strong pillar. Yet the AfD, bluntly described by the head of the country\u2019s internal intelligence agency as a propagator of Russian narratives, has been surging in the polls. It is now in a dead tie for second place with the ruling Social Democrats. At the opposite political pole Sahra Wagenknecht, a telegenic leftist and at-all-costs peacenik, says pollsters tell her she could win 19-30% of a German national vote. Although public support for helping Ukraine remains strong, the trend is drifting downwards.\nUseful-idiot narratives are surprisingly resilient. Their  main points\u2014that NATO \u201cprovoked\u201d Russia\u2019s repeated attacks on and eventual invasion of Ukraine, that Ukraine is an artificial entity created on land that is rightfully Russia\u2019s, and that America pours oil on this fire to sell weapons and sustain its global hegemony\u2014echo in various ways. One is what Italians call benaltrismo or whataboutery: NATO attacked Serbia in 1999 and Libya in 2011, plus America invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, so what\u2019s the big deal if Russia misbehaves? Another variety is dietrismo, the notion that there must be some \u201cinside\u201d story behind events. Writing in the New Left Review, Wolfgang Streeck, a German sociologist, posits that the hidden purpose of the crisis is to set the stage for putting a fearful EU under the thumb of a pumped-up NATO.\nWhat seems to link Europe\u2019s far right, far left and \u201cintellectual\u201d opposition to Western policy is something simpler, however. It is a hoary, cold-war-style anti-Americanism. The East German-born Mr Chrupalla, for instance, insists the Amis have profited from Ukraine\u2019s war by forcing Germany to switch from piped Russian natural gas to costlier liquified gas shipped from America. This is a trap, he hints, because imported American energy is so much more expensive that German manufacturers will have to shift production to America. Ms Wagenknecht, his left-wing rival, believes America forced the war on Russia by attempting to pull Ukraine into its \u201csphere of influence\u201d.\nAt a recent political rally near Berlin Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, found himself heckled by a chorus of beefy peaceniks shouting \u201cWarmonger!\u201d Normally polite, soft-spoken and unflappable, Mr Scholz roared back into the microphone that it was Mr Putin who wanted to destroy and conquer Ukraine. \u201cIf you loudmouths had even a little bit of brain, you would know the real warmonger!\u201d \u25a0\nStay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Vladimir Putin\u2019s useful idiots", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Europe"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/75ks360ifh4d6k3c3n17b7s7uqcvb61a", "tegID": "75ks360ifh4d6k3c3n17b7s7uqcvb61a", "headline": "Europe", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/06/there-are-fears-in-the-baltic-states-that-the-alliance-is-being-complacent", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/re0e3lsc8t5jncvf9th1tjtca0rb7tf3", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "There are fears in the Baltic states that the alliance is being complacent", "subheadline": "NATO\u2019s star pupils", "datePublished": "2023-07-06T11:54:57Z", "description": "Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania see a threat from Russia that will not go away", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230708_EUP503.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/06/can-swedens-two-track-economy-avoid-a-recession", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/5ad5elo11d2v95f1ap65u4no71t6brmb", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Can Sweden\u2019s two-track economy avoid a recession?", "subheadline": "Sweden\u2019s two-track economy", "datePublished": "2023-07-06T11:54:57Z", "description": "Property is a big problem", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230708_EUP502.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/05/the-burning-of-the-banlieues", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/1qgi8vdj1mrlbdvqpuavdjtgd14ce9gp", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "The burning of the banlieues", "subheadline": "Charlemagne", "datePublished": "2023-07-05T18:31:04Z", "description": "France takes a hard look at itself after a week of violence", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230708_EUD000.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/04/ukraine-wants-american-cluster-bombs-quickly", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/92orqt7g58bi22i62hqfod7i369alqg5", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Ukraine wants American cluster bombs\u2014quickly", "subheadline": "Bomblets away", "datePublished": "2023-07-04T16:06:37Z", "description": "They would help the counter-offensive.

"articleBody": "Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\n\nIn early May Russia\u2019s ambassador to Germany threw a party to honour Soviet victory in the second world war. Guests at the embassy, a Stalin-era colossus that occupies more German territory than the nearby parliament building, included a host of dignitaries. The last boss of communist East Germany, Egon Krenz, now 86, mingled under the chandeliers with Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, chancellor of united Germany from 1998 to 2005 (and, more recently, a lobbyist for Russian energy firms). Tino Chrupalla, co-leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party, sported a tie in the colours of the Russian Federation.\nThe event earned a bit of scorn in the German press, but little other notice. Sixteen months into Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine public opinion in Germany, as across Europe, overwhelmingly views Russia as an aggressor to be shunned, and Ukraine as a defender deserving help. The purveyors of Russian influence now stand diminished. Mr Schr\u00f6der, for instance, chaired the board of the now-closed Nord Stream pipelines that addicted Germany to Russian gas. Last summer Russia shut the pipes, which mysterious saboteurs then blew up. The ex-chancellor has been bumped from clubs, disinvited from his Social Democratic Party\u2019s functions (though he remains a party member), and stripped of government-provided office facilities. As for Mr Chrupalla, the AfD leader\u2019s cosiness with Russia did not just annoy German tabloids. Leaked messages reveal dismay among his own party\u2019s MPs.\nYet even if Russia\u2019s effort to project persuasive power across Europe has not quite succeeded, neither has it completely failed. A subculture of what Germans dismiss as Putinversteher\u2014sympathisers who \u201cunderstand\u201d the Russian leader Vladimir Putin\u2014thrives outside the mainstream. Throughout Europe their whispering forms a leitmotif in the rumble of complaint about seemingly unrelated troubles such as inflation, crumbling public services, overbearing regulations and fears of immigration. The grumblers have only just begun to challenge the scale of their governments\u2019 generosity to Ukraine, which by February this year amounted to more than \u20ac60bn ($65bn) in economic and military aid from Brussels and the EU\u2019s individual members (and \u20ac70bn if Britain is added, a sum roughly equal to America\u2019s contribution). If Ukraine\u2019s fight goes on too long or goes wrong, there are plenty waiting in the wings to take up the blame game.\nEurope\u2019s \u201cuseful idiots\u201d, a cold-war term for unwitting allies of communism, span a wide spectrum. In politics, parties on both the far right and far left disagree on much; over Ukraine these extremes have often converged in demanding an instant \u201cpeace\u201d that would in effect reward Russian aggression with land. In the media and academe, intellectuals still seem happy to ignore evidence of Russia\u2019s imperial intent and its drift into criminality, and to bemoan European entanglement in what they parse as a proxy war between America and Russia, or perhaps, speculating more grandly still, between America and China. And in the world of business, despite multiple rounds of Western sanctions, Russia still has plenty of \u201cfriends\u201d too. \nMr Putin\u2019s enablers include several European governments. Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary since 2010, has been the most obvious. The populist strongman has repeatedly criticised Western support for Ukraine and continued Hungary\u2019s imports of Russian gas. His government also refuses to allow the transit of weapons given to Ukraine by Hungary\u2019s fellow members of NATO and the EU. Next-door Austria has, more quietly but equally profitably, largely sat out the struggle, too, citing its non-membership of NATO and self-appointed role as a bridge between East and West, offering little aid to Ukraine even as its trade with Russia has surged. \nGreece, another EU member, is complying with the EU\u2019s sanctions, but has balked at tightening any further those on shipping Russian oil, perhaps because Greek firms happen to pocket so much from the trade. Only recently and under heavy American pressure did Cyprus, an offshore financial haven, shut down some 4,000 local bank accounts held by Russians. Facing less pressure, non-EU countries such as Turkey and Serbia don\u2019t even bother to disguise the lucrative back-door service they provide to Russia. \nSome countries have twisted seemingly noble intentions into policies that warm Mr Putin\u2019s heart. Citing its vaunted neutrality, Switzerland has wielded arcane local laws to block the supply of arms to Ukraine, including 96 mothballed Leopard tanks sitting in Italy that happen to belong to a private Swiss firm. Scoring repeated own goals with freedom-of-speech principles, police in Sweden have permitted public burnings of the Koran. This has hugely irked Muslim-majority Turkey, which wields a veto over Sweden\u2019s bid to join NATO. And Mr Putin has gleefully trolled the Swedes. On a trip to Dagestan before the Eid holiday at the end of June, he had himself filmed tenderly holding a Koran, as he explained that under Russian law it is a crime to desecrate holy things.    \nYet even solid-looking bricks in the would-be European wall of support for Ukraine can crumble. Slovakia, for instance, has been a vital conduit for Western aid and recently pledged its fleet of 13 Soviet-era Mig-29 fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force. But polls show that the party of Robert Fico, a Russophile leftist who has blamed \u201cUkrainian fascists\u201d for provoking Mr Putin, looks likely to win national elections scheduled for September.\nFrance is a linchpin of both NATO and the EU. But a French parliamentary panel recently scolded Marine Le Pen, the closest challenger to President Emmanuel Macron in last year\u2019s election, for parroting Russian propaganda following its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Ms Le Pen strenuously denies that her defence of Mr Putin had anything to do with the \u20ac9m in loans her party received that year from Russian-controlled banks. She has condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but last October, seven months into the war, she declared that sanctions on Russia were not working. \nIn Italy, although the hard-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, is a strong supporter of Ukraine, Matteo Salvini, who leads the second-biggest party in her coalition, is another opponent of sanctions and, at least up until the invasion, was a declared fan of Mr Putin\u2019s.\nGermany, like France, seems a strong pillar. Yet the AfD, bluntly described by the head of the country\u2019s internal intelligence agency as a propagator of Russian narratives, has been surging in the polls. It is now in a dead tie for second place with the ruling Social Democrats. At the opposite political pole Sahra Wagenknecht, a telegenic leftist and at-all-costs peacenik, says pollsters tell her she could win 19-30% of a German national vote. Although public support for helping Ukraine remains strong, the trend is drifting downwards.\nUseful-idiot narratives are surprisingly resilient. Their  main points\u2014that NATO \u201cprovoked\u201d Russia\u2019s repeated attacks on and eventual invasion of Ukraine, that Ukraine is an artificial entity created on land that is rightfully Russia\u2019s, and that America pours oil on this fire to sell weapons and sustain its global hegemony\u2014echo in various ways. One is what Italians call benaltrismo or whataboutery: NATO attacked Serbia in 1999 and Libya in 2011, plus America invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, so what\u2019s the big deal if Russia misbehaves? Another variety is dietrismo, the notion that there must be some \u201cinside\u201d story behind events. Writing in the New Left Review, Wolfgang Streeck, a German sociologist, posits that the hidden purpose of the crisis is to set the stage for putting a fearful EU under the thumb of a pumped-up NATO.\nWhat seems to link Europe\u2019s far right, far left and \u201cintellectual\u201d opposition to Western policy is something simpler, however. It is a hoary, cold-war-style anti-Americanism. The East German-born Mr Chrupalla, for instance, insists the Amis have profited from Ukraine\u2019s war by forcing Germany to switch from piped Russian natural gas to costlier liquified gas shipped from America. This is a trap, he hints, because imported American energy is so much more expensive that German manufacturers will have to shift production to America. Ms Wagenknecht, his left-wing rival, believes America forced the war on Russia by attempting to pull Ukraine into its \u201csphere of influence\u201d.\nAt a recent political rally near Berlin Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, found himself heckled by a chorus of beefy peaceniks shouting \u201cWarmonger!\u201d Normally polite, soft-spoken and unflappable, Mr Scholz roared back into the microphone that it was Mr Putin who wanted to destroy and conquer Ukraine. \u201cIf you loudmouths had even a little bit of brain, you would know the real warmonger!\u201d \u25a0\nStay on top of our
