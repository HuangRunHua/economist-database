France that were hit by a week of rioting. The violence started after police shot dead a teenager of Algerian descent for driving away from a traffic stop. The ensuing riots spread from Paris to most cities across France, even spilling over to Belgium and Switzerland. More than 4,000 rioters were arrested; their average age was just 17. The government promised to help rebuild the more than 2,000 businesses that were attacked by looters. The French president told the mayors that \u201cWe all want a lasting, republican order.\u201d \nThe Wagner Group is still actively recruiting mercenary troops to fight in Ukraine, according to press reports. That would contradict the agreement that Wagner reached with the Kremlin following a recent aborted mutiny. Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner\u2019s leader, who supposedly went to Belarus as part of the agreement, is now in St Petersburg, according to the Belarusian dictator, Alexander Lukashenko.\nRussia said it shot down five drones over the suburbs of Moscow, the third drone attack on Russia in two months. No one was injured. Vnukovo International Airport was closed as a precaution for a short time.\nNATO extended Jens Stoltenberg\u2019s term as secretary-general by a year. He was supposed to step down on October 1st, but the military alliance can\u2019t settle on an alternative for the job and have decided to stick with the continuity that Mr Stoltenberg brings to the position. He has won widespread praise for his leadership during the war in Ukraine. \nCasualty\nBritain\u2019s National Health Service celebrated its 75th anniversary. The NHS is beset with problems: staff shortages, strikes and long waiting times, a bad prognosis for the septuagenarian service. Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, has set out a long-term workforce plan which aims to cure its ills. The NHS is the biggest employer in Europe, with 1.4m staff, but it is short of 112,000 workers.\nIsrael launched its biggest raid on a Palestinian city in the West Bank since 2002. During the 48-hour incursion into Jenin, 12 Palestinians (Israel says they were all militants) and one Israeli soldier were killed and dozens of Palestinians injured. The Israelis said they destroyed 30 workshops and weapons caches. Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza, claimed that a car-ramming and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv in which seven Israelis were injured was in response to the raid on Jenin. \nSenegal\u2019s president, Macky Sall, said he would not run for re-election next year, ending speculation that he would flout a constitutional requirement that he should serve no more than two terms. However, he repeated his argument that a tweak to the constitution allowed him a third term. Democrats in the region hope his decision will help persuade other leaders to follow suit.\n\nSalva Kiir, who has presided over South Sudan amid much turmoil since its independence in 2011, said that delayed elections set for next year would go ahead and that he would run for re-election. His rival and current vice-president, Riek Machar, is expected to stand against him.\n\nThe civil war in Sudan showed no sign of ending, despite a string of short-lived ceasefires. Violence persisted across the country, especially in the capital, Khartoum, and in Darfur, the long-troubled western region. \nJoe Biden said he would use \u201cevery tool at our disposal\u201d to push through a scheme for student-debt relief, after the Supreme Court struck down his original plan. The court made several radical decisions at the end of its term, notably scrapping the affirmative-action policies that have steered college admissions for decades. The court found that the policies \u201crequire stereotyping\u201d and discriminated against Asian-Americans. It also bolstered the rights of businesses to withhold services to gay weddings on free-speech grounds. \nGuatemala\u2019s constitutional court suspended the declaration of the results from an election held on June 25th. Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, the candidate of the anti-corruption Semilla party, had unexpectedly won a place in the run-off election for the presidency by coming second to Sandra Torres, a former first lady.
