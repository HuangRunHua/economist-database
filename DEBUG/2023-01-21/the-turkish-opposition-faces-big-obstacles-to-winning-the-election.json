But the opposition is running out of momentum ahead of the summer election and is now seeing its lead over the AK-MHP alliance narrow. The parties face three major hurdles.\nOne is the media. Many of Turkey\u2019s news channels, especially its public broadcasters, have turned into government PR agencies. The Kurdish HDP has been subjected to an informal media ban since 2017. Through censorship, fear of criminal prosecution and the blacklisting of certain pundits and journalists, the media have no power to hold Mr Erdogan to account.\n\nThe second is Turkey\u2019s leader.

With only months to go before the election, the Nation Alliance, as the opposition calls itself, has still not come up with a united candidate for the presidency. Mr Kilicdaroglu, the CHP chairman, seems determined to run, but is facing pushback from Meral Aksener, the leader of IYI.

Mr Yavas, a hardline nationalist, may be too unpalatable to Kurdish voters.\nA way with Kurds\nThere is a broader problem for the opposition alliance. Although it needs the votes of Turkey\u2019s Kurds to have a shot at unseating Mr Erdogan, the opposition has given the HDP, the third-biggest group in parliament, the cold shoulder. The CHP continues to court the party\u2019s support. But IYI nationalists, who see the HDP as merely the PKK\u2019s political wing, refuse to sit at the same table. \nThe HDP and its 6m voters, who have seen dozens of Kurdish mayors and parliamentarians thrown in prison since 2016, have no love for Mr Erdogan.

Disputes over issues like America\u2019s support for the YPG, Europe\u2019s attitude to the PKK, or sanctions on Russia and Iran, are bound to continue.\nOn too many issues,the opposition has given Mr Erdogan a blank cheque. The CHP backed the government\u2019s gunboat diplomacy in the east Mediterranean, its offensives against Kurdish fighters in Syria, its intervention in Libya, its rapprochement with Russia and even its calamitous purchase of Russian S-400 missiles.

In policy documents the opposition bloc, headed by the CHP and IYI, a centre-right party founded by defectors from the MHP nationalists, has plans for a post-Erdogan future. Constitutional changes will dismantle Mr Erdogan\u2019s executive presidency, hand back to parliament the powers enjoyed by the palace, restore the post of prime minister, free the courts from political influence and lower from 7% to 3% the election threshold that keeps small parties out of parliament. With the central bank in charge of monetary policy again, zombie companies and government cronies cut off from free credit and inflation under control, foreign investment will gush in. \u201cTurkey is going to be a target for a once-in-a-decade trade,\u201d says Bilge Yilmaz, head of IYI\u2019s economic team.\nMost Turks, even AK voters who may be disappointed with the presidential system and the economy, could get behind such a programme. But the opposition is running out of momentum ahead of the summer election and is now seeing its lead over the AK-MHP alliance narrow. The parties face three major hurdles.\nOne is the media. Many of Turkey\u2019s news channels, especially its public broadcasters, have turned into government PR agencies. The Kurdish HDP has been subjected to an informal media ban since 2017. Through censorship, fear of criminal prosecution and the blacklisting of certain pundits and journalists, the media have no power to hold Mr Erdogan to account.\n\nThe second is Turkey\u2019s leader. Mr Erdogan has a history of using the central bank and the treasury to prime the economy ahead of elections, and the courts to harass opponents. He will not hesitate to do all of this again. \nThe third obstacle is the opposition itself. With only months to go before the election, the Nation Alliance, as the opposition calls itself, has still not come up with a united candidate for the presidency. Mr Kilicdaroglu, the CHP chairman, seems determined to run, but is facing pushback from Meral Aksener, the leader of IYI. Cracks within the opposition are starting to show.\nMr Kilicdaroglu is a capable manager, and can take much credit for opposition success in the 2019 local elections, which saw AK mayoral candidates defeated in Turkey\u2019s three largest cities. But he may also be unelectable. As a public speaker, he does not hold a candle to Mr Erdogan. The Turkish leader\u2019s mass rallies have the atmosphere of a rock concert. Mr Kilicdaroglu\u2019s can feel like a fireside lecture. Another concern is that the CHP leader hails from the Alevi religious minority, which faces prejudice from Sunni conservatives and the far right. \nPolls suggest two other CHP leaders, Mr Imamoglu, the Istanbul mayor, and Mansur Yavas, mayor of Ankara, would fare better. But to run for president each would have to resign and hand over the mayor\u2019s office to AK, which controls the Ankara and Istanbul city councils. Each also has a weak spot. Mr Imamoglu\u2019s star had already faded after his shock victory in 2019, and he has now been handed a ban from politics (though he will appeal). Mr Yavas, a hardline nationalist, may be too unpalatable to Kurdish voters.\nA way with Kurds\nThere is a broader problem for the opposition alliance. Although it needs the votes of Turkey\u2019s Kurds to have a shot at unseating Mr Erdogan, the opposition has given the HDP, the third-biggest group in parliament, the cold shoulder. The CHP continues to court the party\u2019s support. But IYI nationalists, who see the HDP as merely the PKK\u2019s political wing, refuse to sit at the same table. \nThe HDP and its 6m voters, who have seen dozens of Kurdish mayors and parliamentarians thrown in prison since 2016, have no love for Mr Erdogan. But they are disappointed with the Nation Alliance, which shies away from speaking about Kurdish rights. \u201cWhen it comes to solving the Kurdish problem, they behave timidly, spinelessly,\u201d says Pervin Buldan, the HDP\u2019s co-chair. \u201cIf they think differently from AK, they have to make it clear, otherwise they will be no different from the government.\u201d The HDP has now said it will nominate its own presidential candidate.\nWorking out what the opposition stands for is also hard in foreign policy. CHP and IYI politicians claim to want to patch up relations with America and Europe, to turn Turkey back into a dependable NATO ally, to issue fewer threats and to reduce dependency on Russia. But they acknowledge that Turkey is too big and too independent, and exists in too tough a neighbourhood, to stay in lockstep with its Western partners. Disputes over issues like America\u2019s support for the YPG, Europe\u2019s attitude to the PKK, or sanctions on Russia and Iran, are bound to continue.\nOn too many issues,the opposition has given Mr Erdogan a blank cheque. The CHP backed the government\u2019s gunboat diplomacy in the east Mediterranean, its offensives against Kurdish fighters in Syria, its intervention in Libya, its rapprochement with Russia and even its calamitous purchase of Russian S-400 missiles. As soon as Mr Erdogan invokes national security, the opposition falls into line. \u201cWhenever there is criticism against one policy or another, the government accuses the opposition of taking sides with the terrorists,\u201d says one CHP lawmaker. \u201cYou cannot express your views and opinions without being pushed into a corner.\u201d\nGiven Mr Erdogan\u2019s insistence that any dissent on matters of national security equals treason, a reluctance to criticise him is perhaps understandable. But it does not inspire confidence. \u201cWhat the hell are they going to do that is very different?\u201d asks Soli Ozel, an academic at Kadir Has University in Istanbul. \u201cEither they don\u2019t have the courage of their convictions, or they don\u2019t have convictions.\u201d Rather than find a strategy to win, the opposition seems merely to be waiting for Mr Erdogan and the AK party to lose. That may not be enough.\u25a0", "description": "They remain rudderless", "ogDescription": "They remain rudderless", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230121_SRP514.jpg",
