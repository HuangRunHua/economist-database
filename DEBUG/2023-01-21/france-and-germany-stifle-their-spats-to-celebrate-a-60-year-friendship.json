On January 22nd this year, 60 years after Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer met, the two countries\u2019 current leaders will renew their predecessors\u2019 vows. \nEmmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz, as well as scores of their ministers and parliamentarians, will gather in Paris for a day of festivities and meetings designed to mark the resilience and richness of this cross-border tie, which has no real equivalent elsewhere within the European Union. The day will begin, symbolically, at the Sorbonne, where in 2017 a freshly elected Mr Macron first laid out his vision for a  more sovereign Europe. Both leaders will speak, ahead of a joint cabinet meeting, and doubtless find a common language to talk about Europe over the coming decade.\nYet the summit comes at a challenging time for the bilateral bond. The meeting was originally scheduled for last October, but was cancelled by the French at short notice\u2014ostensibly due to diary issues, but widely interpreted as a reflection of irritation at Germany. French officials were already aghast when Mr Scholz failed in August to mention France in a big speech on Europe in Prague, and in another at a French-German business club. (German aides say these were not \u201csnubs\u201d.) They were even more so after Germany\u2019s unilateral announcement that it would spend \u20ac200bn ($216bn) to protect Germans from high energy costs, without warning France, as would be customary for such a budget-busting move.\nIn truth, Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has \u201claid bare Franco-German differences, and they are struggling to find common ground,\u201d says Tara Varma of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank. Foremost among these are defence and energy. \nFrance is delighted that Germany is spending more on defence. The two countries have, at last, reached an industrial agreement to develop a joint next-generation fighter aircraft. Yet the lesson that Germany and much of eastern Europe draw from the war is that the continent is right to look to America and NATO for cover. To French chagrin, Germany has chosen to equip its air force with \u20ac10bn-worth of new American F-35 fighter jets. For Mr Macron, who has a French defence industry to protect and Europe in his veins, the lesson is rather different: that the EU should push even harder for \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d, albeit in a way that is compatible with NATO, in defence as well as industry.  \nSuch differences have prompted public irritation. Mr Scholz has paid a high diplomatic price for being slow to step up for Ukraine. He is under particular pressure from European allies to send German-made Leopard 2 main battle tanks, and to enable others, notably Poland, that need German re-export permission to do so. But many in his government are galled that, although Germany has provided far more overall aid to Ukraine than France, Mr Macron has often got more credit. \nTake the president\u2019s recent announcement that France would deliver light tanks to Ukraine, just a day before Germany and America made similar offers. Ever self-critical, German commentators were quick to suggest that Mr Macron\u2019s move had \u201cforced\u201d a grudging Mr Scholz into action\u2014something the chancellery in Berlin denies. \u201cMacron knows we are eminently shame-able,\u201d says Thorsten Benner of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think-tank.\nOn energy, too, the war has exposed old disagreements. France\u2019s preference for nuclear power has for years rubbed up against Germany\u2019s firm rejection of it. Germany\u2019s reliance on cheap Russian fuel for its industry has forced a radical rethink of a strategy that kept it prosperous for the past 30 years. The pair have sparred in public over alternatives, notably an ill-fated plan to build a gas pipeline to France from Spain, which France squashed. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for Europe\u201d, declared Mr Macron, \u201cwhen Germany isolates itself.\u201d\nFrance and Germany often disagree. The strength of their tie is their ability to find common ground, and bring others with them. Yet the war has dragged Germany\u2019s attention eastwards. France likes to think it is always at the top of Germany\u2019s concerns, a sensitivity German leaders traditionally indulge. But with a wobbly three-way coalition government, Germany has been distracted. Gazing ever-inward, on January 17th Mr Scholz replaced one relatively obscure loyalist from his party, Christine Lambrecht, with another, Boris Pistorius, as defence minister.\nNor have the two leaders found much personal chemistry. Mr Scholz\u2019s persona is what Germans expect of a native of Hamburg: quiet pragmatism, a dry, tight-lipped formality and a slightly acid sense of humour. Useful in German politics, these qualities do not inspire passion, nor suit him to wartime leadership. For Mr Macron, who brims with energy and ideas and likes to speak his mind, this makes for a tricky partnership. The French, says one insider, find Mr Scholz unusually difficult to read.\nThe summit will doubtless disguise such troubles. Germany may be looking eastwards, and inwards. France may be strengthening other European ties: a new treaty with Spain, an upcoming summit with Britain. Yet the density of the link between France and Germany is unique. Both countries know that they are condemned to find a way to talk to each other, however tough that may be right now.\u25a0", "description": "The war in Ukraine puts a testy partnership under stress",
