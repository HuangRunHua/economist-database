When silver was discovered in the highlands of Bolivia in 1545, the village of Potos\u00ed briefly became one of the most densely inhabited places on Earth as it provided more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s supply. A century later, with the mines depleted, it was a ghost town. \nAs China reopens after almost three years of lockdowns, some countries in Latin America are preparing for another boom. Morgan Stanley, a bank, thinks China\u2019s economy could grow by 5.7% in 2023. That would trigger rising demand for the region\u2019s goods. China consumes more than 16% of the world\u2019s oil, over half of its copper and more than three-fifths of its iron ore. When rumours circulated last year that covid-19 restrictions would be lifted, the price of copper jumped by 7% in a day. \nAll this is good news for commodities exporters such as Chile and Brazil. Fully 67% of Chile\u2019s copper exports go to China; Brazil sends 70% of its soyabean exports to China. But, like the silver and gold rushes of the past, the good times may not last. Although strong growth this year is likely, the longer-term relationship between China and the region could disappoint.\nIn the decade after 2002 Latin America\u2019s dollar GDP grew by more than 3% a year, thanks to a commodities boom triggered by Chinese industrialisation. China\u2019s state-directed \u201cpolicy banks\u201d, including China Development Bank and Export-Import Bank, provided more than $138bn in loans to Latin America between 2005 and 2020. Poverty fell and government coffers swelled as China bought the region\u2019s grains, metals and hydrocarbons. \n\nTrade with China grew from $12bn in 2000, or 0.6% of Latin America\u2019s GDP, to $445bn in 2021 (8.5% of the region\u2019s GDP). By 2021 China accounted for 18% of Latin American trade, up from 5% in 2005. Excluding Mexico, the share rises to 24% (see chart). Whereas China became South America\u2019s top trading partner, the United States remains that of Mexico and Central America. Brazil, Chile, and Peru all run trade surpluses with China.\nBooming trade has led to complacency among some Latin American politicians. Many expect the relationship to always stay the same, says Margaret Myers of the Inter-American Dialogue, a think-tank in Washington, DC. But this overlooks structural issues in China, such as a domestic property slump and the fallout from a trade war with the United States. There are already signs that China\u2019s engagement with some parts of the region is weakening.\n\nSince 2020 China\u2019s policy banks have approved no new loans to the region (see chart). Although commercial banks and private-equity funds have filled part of the gap, they are not as generous. Venezuela, which used to get two-thirds of Chinese finance in the region, today only receives credit to help it maintain oil shipments to China. \nChinese lending changed after several bad experiences. China struggled to recover millions of dollars in oil-for-loans deals with Venezuela after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the autocratic president, came to power in 2013 and oil prices fell. Elsewhere, pushback from environmental groups also stalled investments, as did shifting policies under different administrations. \nAccording to AidData, a research institute at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, between 2000 and 2017 more high-value transactions linked to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative were suspended or cancelled in Latin America than almost anywhere else. Similarly, work by CEPAL, a UN-linked research organisation, shows that Chinese investment peaked between 2010 and 2014 and has fallen since then.\nEven if engagement with the region increases again as China reopens, it will not follow the same pattern. As China\u2019s economy shifts towards services and manufacture of high-tech goods, electric vehicles and renewable-energy products, its imports and investments abroad will change. China\u2019s imports of crude oil will fall, while those of critical metals will increase. From 2005 to 2009, 95% of total foreign direct investment (FDI) by China in the region went into raw materials.  By 2015 to 2021, this share had fallen to 46%, with the balance split between manufacturing and services.\nBetween 2017 and 2021 Latin American exports to China of aluminium, used in solar panels, were 28 times as large as in the previous four years. China\u2019s annual imports of balsa wood from Ecuador, used in wind turbines, rose by 57% over the same period. Lithium may be particularly prized. The price of lithium carbonate, used in batteries for electric vehicles, soared in 2021 and 2022 from a five-year average of $14,000 per tonne to $72,000. \nOther commodities may have a trickier future. The price of copper is expected by Goldman Sachs, a bank, to rise from $9,000 per tonne today to $11,000 in the next 12 months. But Andr\u00e9s B\u00f3rquez at the University of Chile thinks that less of it may be needed\u2014and that if China replenishes its copper reserves, which are at their lowest for 15 years, demand will eventually plateau. That could hurt certain overexposed countries, such as Chile: 38% of its exports go to China, over three-quarters of which are copper.  \nChinese investments are also becoming more strategic. Electricity is a key area. Between 2017 and 2021 investments in this sector made up 71% of Chinese mergers and acquisitions in the region, according to Boston University\u2019s Global Development Policy Centre. In 2021 two Chinese state-owned firms splurged $6bn collectively to buy Chilean and Peruvian electricity companies. Both projects were among the largest foreign investments ever received by either country. \nChinese investment in other infrastructure appears to be accelerating. A survey by Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University reckons that of 192 regional infrastructure projects with Chinese involvement undertaken between 2005 and 2021, 57 were carried out in 2020 and 2021. The reasons may have to do with strategic projects linked to strengthening China\u2019s food security. A state-owned firm is building a port 50km (30 miles) north of Lima in order to increase China\u2019s supply of food. (So far the protests in Peru do not appear to have affected it.)\nAll this has ruffled feathers in Washington. In 2020 Donald Trump\u2019s administration put pressure on Brazil not to allow Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant, to participate in a 5G auction. The Brazilian government went ahead anyway, but is creating a separate network for government agencies that excludes Huawei. Similarly, the Trump administration extended a loan to Ecuador to help it pay off billions of dollars\u2019 worth of debt to China on the condition that it exclude Chinese telecoms firms from its 5G network. In 2021 the G7 launched \u201cBuild Back Better World\u201d, to compete with Chinese infrastructure investment around the world. It was such a flop that it had to be rebranded last year.\nSouth America has less to gain than Central America from cosying up to the United States. Brazil\u2019s relationship with China \u201cjust really makes sense\u201d, says Larissa Wachholz, at Brazil\u2019s Centre for International Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s beneficial for both sides.\u201d She thinks the investment that is lacking in Latin America\u2014in roads, ports and utilities\u2014is exactly what China can offer. Now that the leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is in power in Brazil, its government is likely to make more overtures to China. \nA few countries are trying to lessen their reliance on the Asian superpower. Although Ecuador\u2019s centre-right president is finalising a free-trade agreement with China, his administration also wants to join the Pacific Alliance, a trade bloc composed of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Uruguay, which exports more than 60% of its beef to China, is seeking a free-trade deal with China as well as trying to join other free-trade agreements.
