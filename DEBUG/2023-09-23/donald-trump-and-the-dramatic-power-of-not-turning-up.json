handwriting, her furs, her ostrich-feather fan and azalea perfume\u2014along with her beauty, cruelty, secrets and lies: traces of Rebecca are everywhere in \u201cRebecca\u201d. At Manderley, her husband\u2019s country pile, her evening dresses seem to rustle eternally in the breeze. \u201cHer footsteps sounded in the corridors,\u201d writes Daphne du Maurier, \u201cher scent lingered on the stairs.\u201d Above all she intrudes in the twisted devotion of the housekeeper, Mrs Danvers. Yet Rebecca herself, dead before the novel opens, never directly appears.\nHis orange skin and blond quiff, the erratically capitalised social-media posts, demeaning nicknames and gimme-a-breaks: in a similar sort of way, although Donald Trump skipped the Republican presidential debate in August, his image haunted it. He may well pull off the same trick in the second debate on September 27th. Mr Trump seems to intuit something which du Maurier and other storytellers have grasped\u2014that a character you don\u2019t see can make a bigger impression than those you do. \nIn fiction, as in life, absence can be a power play. The leader, don or spymaster asserts his authority over other characters, and impresses it on you, by relying on minions to do his bidding. The titular boss in \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d issues orders to his agents while his face stays out of sight. In the British sitcom \u201cYes, Minister\u201d the prime minister is capricious but invisible. When, in the first debate, Mike Pence referred to Mr Trump as \u201cone that\u2019s probably looking on\u201d, he made the no-show sound almost celestial.\nAbsence can cultivate fear, since what you cannot see is often scarier than what is revealed. Stirred by creepy music, each imagination fills the void with its own horrors. Viewers do not see the baddie who stalks the film students in \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d (pictured), nor the hunter who shoots Bambi\u2019s mother. The driver whose lorry hounds the protagonist of Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cDuel\u201d is not identified. (Conversely, the shark in \u201cJaws\u201d is much less terrifying after it surfaces on screen.) \nThe unseen are a mystery. Sometimes it is ultimately dispelled, as with the Wizard of Oz, Boo Radley in \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d and Harry Lime in \u201cThe Third Man\u201d. Sometimes the mystique endures. So remote is Big Brother that readers of \u201c1984\u201d cannot know if he is, or ever was, a real person. In two James Bond films, 007\u2019s arch-enemy Ernst Blofeld appears as a pair of hands stroking a cat. During the first debate, live shots of Fulton County jail, where Mr Trump was due to turn himself in, had the air of a villain\u2019s lair, the tenebrous place standing in for the elusive man. \nMost subtly, a hidden figure can be a mirror and measure of other people\u2019s vices and virtues. Initially Romeo is moping not for Juliet but for Rosaline, in his view the fairest maiden \u201csince first the world begun\u201d. Audiences never meet her, but she supplies an early sense of his overheated emotions. Anton Chekhov was an expert in devising this kind of absentee. In \u201cThree Sisters\u201d the gallantry and philosophising of Vershinin, an army officer, are undercut by his blithe neglect of his suicidal wife\u2014who is always offstage. \nLikewise in the first debate Mr Trump provided a spectral yardstick of the other candidates\u2019 independence. Chris Christie incurred boos for saying that some of his actions were \u201cbeneath the office of president\u201d. Vivek Ramaswamy praised Mr Trump to the heavens. Ron DeSantis tried to wriggle between condemnation and defence, a spectacle as agonising as watching him try to smile.\nThe most famous unseen character in literature combines these effects. In Samuel Beckett\u2019s \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d, Vladimir and Estragon are not sure what Godot looks like, whether he will ever materialise and, if he does, whether salvation or punishment will ensue. Godot gives them a purpose yet is a pretext for inertia. \u201cIn this immense confusion\u201d, says Vladimir, \u201cone thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come.\u201d\nMr Trump is no Godot. Nor is he really offstage, even on debate nights. He holds court online and in friendly interviews, dominating conversations and front pages whether he shows up or not. His absence projects power, and he evokes fear in many Americans, but he is scarcely a riddle. They have seen the Trump movie before. \nStill, like Vladimir and Estragon, the rest of the Republican field will again be plagued and paralysed by Mr Trump\u2019s shadow should he miss more debates. The play\u2019s ending captures their limbo-like predicament. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d says Estragon, before the deadening final stage direction: \u201cThey do not move.\u201d\u25a0\nRead more from Back Story, our column on culture:\nLots of people mourn when famous writers and musicians die.
