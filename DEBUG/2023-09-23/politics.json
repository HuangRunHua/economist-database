India denied it. Hardeep Singh Nijjar had pushed for a Sikh homeland in India. India says he was a terrorist, Mr Nijjar\u2019s supporters say he was a peaceful activist. Mr Trudeau\u2019s allegation of a fellow democracy assassinating a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil has ramifications beyond a souring of relations with India. America\u2019s National Security Council has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d, and has urged India to co-operate.\nIndia\u2019s MPs held their first session in a new Parliament building, which replaces the old one designed by the British in the 1920s. In May opposition parties protested against its inauguration, accusing Narendra Modi, the prime minister, of turning what was supposed to be a show of national unity into a party rally.\nSpeculation swirled around China\u2019s defence minister, General Li Shangfu, who has not been seen in public for weeks. Some reports suggested that he was under investigation for corruption and would be removed. The episode comes just months after purges of China\u2019s foreign minister, Qin Gang, and the leadership of China\u2019s Rocket Force, which controls the country\u2019s conventional and nuclear missiles.\nChina\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met America\u2019s national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, in Malta. Among the topics discussed was the war in Ukraine. A day later Mr Wang arrived in Moscow, where he met Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. China claims to be neutral in the war, but its officials repeat Kremlin talking points. Local media said Mr Wang\u2019s trip would help pave the way for a visit by Mr Putin to China.\nAzerbaijan sent its army into Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed enclave with a majority Armenian population, in what it described as an \u201canti-terrorism\u201d operation against \u201cillegal Armenian military formations\u201d. Ethnic Armenians agreed to a ceasefire. Tensions have been running high because of Azerbaijan\u2019s blockade of Karabakh, which has led to medicine and fuel shortages. \nVolodymyr Zelensky gave a speech in person to the UN General Assembly in New York, in which he warned that Russia is trying to smash the established international order and push the world to a \u201cfinal war\u201d. The Ukrainian president also compared Russia\u2019s abduction of Ukrainian children to \u201cgenocide\u201d. Mr Zelensky then went to Washington to discuss further help for Ukraine\u2019s war effort. \nHungary, Poland and Slovakia imposed their own curbs on imports of Ukrainian grain, after the European Union lifted a partial ban. As a row over the curbs escalated, Poland said it would no longer supply weapons to Ukraine. \nEvika Silina became Latvia\u2019s new prime minister, after forming another coalition headed by the centre-right New Unity party. One of the first tasks of the new government was to close one of Latvia\u2019s border points with Belarus following an increase in illegal crossings by migrants. \nGreens turn red\nRishi Sunak, Britain\u2019s prime minister, announced some changes to the government\u2019s plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, such as delaying a ban on new petrol cars by five years to 2035. He said this was being done so that the 2050 target could be met in a \u201cbetter, more proportionate\u201d way. In Sweden the government\u2019s budget contained tax-cutting measures, including on fuel duties. Sweden was the first country to lay out an aim of net-zero, but some think the budget means it now won\u2019t be able to hit that goal in 2045. \nThe Italian cabinet approved a measure that extends the time that some migrants can be detained to 18 months. The government is scrambling to respond to a wave of 8,000 migrants who have landed on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa, a favourite destination for the people-smugglers who traffic migrants in boats from Tunisia, just 113 kilometres (61 miles) away. \nProtests broke out against the authorities in Derna, a city in eastern Libya recently devastated by floods. Calls are growing for an international investigation into why the dams in the city burst. \nIsraeli forces killed six Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Four were killed in a raid on Jenin refugee camp, the scene two months ago of Israel\u2019s biggest raid in 20 years. In New York Israel\u2019s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, held a long-awaited meeting with Joe Biden. Mr Biden said the pair had discussed \u201chard issues\u201d.\nOne of the leaders of the Free Current coalition in Egypt, the main liberal opposition party, was sentenced to six months in prison for slander and verbally assaulting a police officer. His supporters say the charges were politically motivated and the party has said it will not put up a candidate in Egypt\u2019s presidential election due next year.  \nIran and America each swapped five prisoners in a deal in which $6bn-worth of frozen Iranian assets, mostly oil revenues, were also released. Shortly after the deal was announced Ebrahim Raisi, Iran\u2019s president, addressed the UN assembly, accusing America of inflaming violence in Ukraine. Meanwhile Iranian MPs passed a draft law imposing sentences of up to ten years on women who flout the country\u2019s dress code, a year after widespread protests against the killing of Mahsa Amini, a woman who was detained for showing her hair.\nThe Dominican Republic sealed its border with Haiti after a breakdown in negotiations over using water from the Massacre River. A farmers\u2019 group in Haiti is building a canal to irrigate land dried out by drought, but this will divert water from the Dominican Republic, says the country\u2019s president, Luis Abinader. \n\nThousands of Guatemalans demonstrated to demand an end to efforts by officials to hinder the transfer of power to Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, who was elected as the country\u2019s president in August. Mr Ar\u00e9valo, a reformist who is due to take office in January, presented a petition asking the Supreme Court to block attempts to overturn his victory. \nAmerica\u2019s merry-go-round\nKevin McCarthy, the speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives, had another battle on his hands with rebels in his Republican Party, who are once again threatening to shut down the government by refusing to back stopgap funding legislation. Meanwhile, America\u2019s gross national debt exceeded $33trn for the first time. \nThe Texas Senate acquitted Ken Paxton, the state\u2019s attorney-general, at his impeachment trial. In May Mr Paxton, a hardline conservative, was impeached by the Texas House of Representatives, which is Republican controlled, for alleged bribery and abuse of public trust.\nPaul Kagame, who has been president of Rwanda since 2000 and its de facto leader since toppling a genocidal government in 1994, said he plans to run for a fourth presidential term next year. Mr Kagame pushed through a constitutional change in 2015 that could allow him to stay in power until 2034.\n\nThe EU has stopped funding Zimbabwe\u2019s electoral commission, citing concerns about its independence during elections in August. Although the electoral funding is worth just $5m, cutting it may signal a deeper breach with the EU, which had  been hoping to mend relations and unlock financial support for Zimbabwe from the World Bank and IMF.\nThere are \u201cgrave and ongoing\u201d violations of human rights taking place in Tigray and other regions of Ethiopia, almost a year since a formal end to its civil war, the UN\u2019s Human Rights Council said in a report. Many of the ongoing atrocities in Tigray are being committed by soldiers from Eritrea, whose forces were supposed to have withdrawn under the terms of the peace deal.\n\nBurkina Faso, Mali and Niger have signed a mutual-defence pact known as the Alliance of Sahel States (ASS). All three members of the ASS are run by military juntas following a series of coups over the past two years.", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Politics",

"Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said that Indian agents were behind the killing of a Sikh leader near Vancouver in June. India denied it. Hardeep Singh Nijjar had pushed for a Sikh homeland in India. India says he was a terrorist, Mr Nijjar\u2019s supporters say he was a peaceful activist. Mr Trudeau\u2019s allegation of a fellow democracy assassinating a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil has ramifications beyond a souring of relations with India. America\u2019s National Security Council has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d, and has urged India to co-operate.\nIndia\u2019s MPs held their first session in a new Parliament building, which replaces the old one designed by the British in the 1920s. In May opposition parties protested against its inauguration, accusing Narendra Modi, the prime minister, of turning what was supposed to be a show of national unity into a party rally.\nSpeculation swirled around China\u2019s defence minister, General Li Shangfu, who has not been seen in public for weeks. Some reports suggested that he was under investigation for corruption and would be removed. The episode comes just months after purges of China\u2019s foreign minister, Qin Gang, and the leadership of China\u2019s Rocket Force, which controls the country\u2019s conventional and nuclear missiles.\nChina\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met America\u2019s national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, in Malta. Among the topics discussed was the war in Ukraine. A day later Mr Wang arrived in Moscow, where he met Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. China claims to be neutral in the war, but its officials repeat Kremlin talking points. Local media said Mr Wang\u2019s trip would help pave the way for a visit by Mr Putin to China.\nAzerbaijan sent its army into Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed enclave with a majority Armenian population, in what it described as an \u201canti-terrorism\u201d operation against \u201cillegal Armenian military formations\u201d. Ethnic Armenians agreed to a ceasefire. Tensions have been running high because of Azerbaijan\u2019s blockade of Karabakh, which has led to medicine and fuel shortages. \nVolodymyr Zelensky gave a speech in person to the UN General Assembly in New York, in which he warned that Russia is trying to smash the established international order and push the world to a \u201cfinal war\u201d. The Ukrainian president also compared Russia\u2019s abduction of Ukrainian children to \u201cgenocide\u201d. Mr Zelensky then went to Washington to discuss further help for Ukraine\u2019s war effort. \nHungary, Poland and Slovakia imposed their own curbs on imports of Ukrainian grain, after the European Union lifted a partial ban. As a row over the curbs escalated, Poland said it would no longer supply weapons to Ukraine. \nEvika Silina became Latvia\u2019s new prime minister, after forming another coalition headed by the centre-right New Unity party. One of the first tasks of the new government was to close one of Latvia\u2019s border points with Belarus following an increase in illegal crossings by migrants. \nGreens turn red\nRishi Sunak, Britain\u2019s prime minister, announced some changes to the government\u2019s plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, such as delaying a ban on new petrol cars by five years to 2035. He said this was being done so that the 2050 target could be met in a \u201cbetter, more proportionate\u201d way. In Sweden the government\u2019s budget contained tax-cutting measures, including on fuel duties. Sweden was the first country to lay out an aim of net-zero, but some think the budget means it now won\u2019t be able to hit that goal in 2045. \nThe Italian cabinet approved a measure that extends the time that some migrants can be detained to 18 months. The government is scrambling to respond to a wave of 8,000 migrants who have landed on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa, a favourite destination for the people-smugglers who traffic migrants in boats from Tunisia, just 113 kilometres (61 miles) away. \nProtests broke out against the authorities in Derna, a city in eastern Libya recently devastated by floods. Calls are growing for an international investigation into why the dams in the city burst. \nIsraeli forces killed six Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Four were killed in a raid on Jenin refugee camp, the scene two months ago of Israel\u2019s biggest raid in 20 years. In New York Israel\u2019s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, held a long-awaited meeting with Joe Biden. Mr Biden said the pair had discussed \u201chard issues\u201d.\nOne of the leaders of the Free Current coalition in Egypt, the main liberal opposition party, was sentenced to six months in prison for slander and verbally assaulting a police officer. His supporters say the charges were politically motivated and the party has said it will not put up a candidate in Egypt\u2019s presidential election due next year.  \nIran and America each swapped five prisoners in a deal in which $6bn-worth of frozen Iranian assets, mostly oil revenues, were also released. Shortly after the deal was announced Ebrahim Raisi, Iran\u2019s president, addressed the UN assembly, accusing America of inflaming violence in Ukraine. Meanwhile Iranian MPs passed a draft law imposing sentences of up to ten years on women who flout the country\u2019s dress code, a year after widespread protests against the killing of Mahsa Amini, a woman who was detained for showing her hair.\nThe Dominican Republic sealed its border with Haiti after a breakdown in negotiations over using water from the Massacre River. A farmers\u2019 group in Haiti is building a canal to irrigate land dried out by drought, but this will divert water from the Dominican Republic, says the country\u2019s president, Luis Abinader. \n\nThousands of Guatemalans demonstrated to demand an end to efforts by officials to hinder the transfer of power to Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, who was elected as the country\u2019s president in August. Mr Ar\u00e9valo, a reformist who is due to take office in January, presented a petition asking the Supreme Court to block attempts to overturn his victory. \nAmerica\u2019s merry-go-round\nKevin McCarthy, the speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives, had another battle on his hands with rebels in his Republican Party, who are once again threatening to shut down the government by refusing to back stopgap funding legislation. Meanwhile, America\u2019s gross national debt exceeded $33trn for the first time. \nThe Texas Senate acquitted Ken Paxton, the state\u2019s attorney-general, at his impeachment trial. In May Mr Paxton, a hardline conservative, was impeached by the Texas House of Representatives, which is Republican controlled, for alleged bribery and abuse of public trust.\nPaul Kagame, who has been president of Rwanda since 2000 and its de facto leader since toppling a genocidal government in 1994, said he plans to run for a fourth presidential term next year. Mr Kagame pushed through a constitutional change in 2015 that could allow him to stay in power until 2034.\n\nThe EU has stopped funding Zimbabwe\u2019s electoral commission, citing concerns about its independence during elections in August. Although the electoral funding is worth just $5m, cutting it may signal a deeper breach with the EU, which had  been hoping to mend relations and unlock financial support for Zimbabwe from the World Bank and IMF.\nThere are \u201cgrave and ongoing\u201d violations of human rights taking place in Tigray and other regions of Ethiopia, almost a year since a formal end to its civil war, the UN\u2019s Human Rights Council said in a report. Many of the ongoing atrocities in Tigray are being committed by soldiers from Eritrea, whose forces were supposed to have withdrawn under the terms of the peace deal.\n\nBurkina Faso, Mali and Niger have signed a mutual-defence pact known as the Alliance of Sahel States (ASS). All three members of the ASS are run by military juntas following a series of coups over the past two years.", "description": "", "ogDescription": "", "imageUrl":
