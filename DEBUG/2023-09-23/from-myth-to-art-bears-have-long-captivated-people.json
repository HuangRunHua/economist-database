"articleBody": "Eight Bears: Mythic Past and Imperilled Future. By Gloria Dickie. W.W. Norton; 272 pages; $30 and \u00a325\nWhen Michael Bond wrote his first draft of \u201cA Bear Called Paddington\u201d in the 1950s, he described his hat-clad protagonist as hailing from \u201cdarkest Africa\u201d. Bond\u2019s literary agent, Harvey Unna, liked the story but spotted an error: no bears lived in Africa. \u201cChildren either know this or should know this,\u201d Unna wrote, adding that, \u201cThere are plenty of bears in Asia, Europe and America, and quite a few on the stock exchange.\u201d Bond changed Paddington\u2019s origins to \u201cdarkest Peru\u201d, modelling him on the spectacled bear from there.\nBears occupy a special place in myth and mind. Youngsters are read stories about Paddington, Winnie-the-Pooh and the three bears and are presented with stuffed teddies. Perhaps also because bears can stand erect on two legs, resembling humans, people have long felt drawn to them. Bears have featured in ancient paintings, constellation names (ursa major, otherwise known as the Big Dipper) and diplomatic negotiations. China\u2019s parcelling out of pandas to allies has precedent: in 1252 King Haakon IV of Norway gave Henry III a polar bear, which spent its days swimming and fishing in the River Thames. \n\u201cEight Bears\u201d explores the wonder and friction that characterise the relationship between bruins and people. The author, Gloria Dickie, a journalist for Reuters, travels around the world, bringing readers on a riveting and unique sort of bear hunt. She dresses up like an \u201cimprisoned smurf\u201d to volunteer at a panda-research centre in China, ventures into arctic temperatures to find polar bears in Canada, hikes in Peru in the hope of seeing Paddington\u2019s ilk and wanders through villages of India to meet people mauled by sloth bears, whose name belies their aggression.\nThere are just eight bear species, compared with 41 types of felines and more than 500 primates. This offers pleasant concision, but Ms Dickie\u2019s tone is sombre. Polar bears are not the only ones on thin ice; most bear species are threatened by habitat destruction and climate change. Pandas, for example, need to eat about 18kg of bamboo a day, but agricultural expansion imperils their food supply. Deforestation has destroyed the habitat of sloth bears (India\u2019s most deadly wild animal). During droughts they roam in search of water, sparking conflict with people, who pursue \u201crevenge kills\u201d after bear attacks.\nMs Dickie concludes that only three bear species are likely to thrive past the end of this century: black bears, American brown bears and pandas. (There are fewer than 2,000 pandas, but China has started to take panda preservation seriously.) \nThis book is about bears but also about people, revealing two opposing sides of human nature. One is people\u2019s cruelty. \u201cBear-baiting\u201d, in which bruins were tied up and forced to fight with dogs, was a popular sport in Britain, made illegal only in 1835. (Elizabeth I so enjoyed bear-baiting that she overruled Parliament\u2019s attempt to ban it in 1585.) Although outlawed in India in 1972, \u201cbear dancing\u201d has persisted. People kill mother sloth bears and kidnap cubs; they then bash out their teeth and sometimes use muzzles with nails, forcing them into a \u201cdance of fear and desperation\u201d that offers \u201cthe illusion of merriment\u201d. \nElsewhere bears are enslaved for their bile. In Vietnam (where bear farming is illegal) and China (where it is not), sun and moon bears are kept in cages. Bile is extracted from their gall bladders in a process akin to torture. The resulting \u201cliquid gold\u201d is sold for its anti-inflammatory properties. Bears\u2019 imprisonment is made all the more disturbing by their intelligence. Researchers have observed that black bears can distinguish between animals and even gauge numbers. \nBut people also have a more positive side. They are building systems that allow for co-existence, from bear \u201cjails\u201d (where creatures are sent if they come too close to population centres) to bear-proof garbage bins and lockers. Many people around the world are trying to save and improve bears\u2019 lives, proving there is some beauty in this story of beasts and humans. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows,
