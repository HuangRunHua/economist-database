There was a time when some Ukrainian officials, having halted Russia\u2019s army outside Kyiv, thought it would take only a few more months to bring the war to a conclusion. \u201cMost of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year,\u201d predicted Lieutenant-General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of military intelligence, in May 2022. By last November, shortly after a spectacular Ukrainian offensive in Kharkiv, Volodymyr Havrylov, a deputy defence minister at the time, was still expecting a swift victory. \u201cMy feeling is that by the end of the spring, this war will be over.\u201d \nIn fact, Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive did not even begin until June. Far from hastening the war\u2019s end, it has demonstrated just how long the fighting could drag on. Ukrainian forces, stymied by Russian minefields and other defences, have inched forward on foot. The deployment of reserves and spiffy Western weapons has not yet yielded any big breakthroughs. Wet weather and a shortage of ammunition will probably bring the Ukrainian advance, such as it is, to a halt by late October, if not earlier. \nAnother fighting season beckons. \u201cWe must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine,\u201d warned Jens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary-general, on September 17th. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a considerable length of time to militarily eject all 200,000 or plus Russian troops out of Russian-occupied Ukraine,\u201d agreed Mark Milley, America\u2019s top general, the same day.\nAmerica insists it will stay the course for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d, as Joe Biden, the president, has put it several times this year. Britain, France, Germany and other allies have all used the same phrase. As ironclad as these pledges sound, they depend on two uncertain variables. One is the West\u2019s ability to furnish Ukraine\u2019s army with enough weapons and ammunition. The other is the political will to keep handing them over.\nStart with the first. Russia\u2019s defence industry moved onto a war footing in the last quarter of 2022, says Richard Connolly, an expert on Russia\u2019s economy, who points to a big jump in steel production. British officials say that Russia can now produce around 200 tanks a year, twice as many as they had previously assumed. Mr Connolly says that, with refurbished tanks included, the true figure is probably 500 to 800. Western sanctions are not crimping output much, he adds, with crucial components such as semiconductors smuggled in via Hong Kong or Central Asia.\nIn principle, Ukraine\u2019s friends should have no trouble helping it outgun Russia. The combined GDP of nato\u2019s members is 12 times that of Russia, even after accounting for Russia\u2019s lower prices. The difference is that Russia is willing to spend much more heavily on the war: military spending now takes up almost 40% of the national budget, far in excess of Western levels. NATO countries are trying to redress this imbalance by investing in arms production, which has been neglected since the cold war ended. But there are two snags.\nOne is cost. Estonia spends around $5,000 to $6,000 on every new artillery shell, says Kusti Salm, the senior civil servant in the country\u2019s defence ministry. That is relatively cheap by NATO standards, he notes. Russia, he says, spends 60,000 roubles, or around $620. The vast difference is largely down to cheaper labour and materials, lower quality products and lower profit margins for arms manufacturers, most of which are state-owned. Inflation is exacerbating the problem. \u201cPrices for equipment and ammunition are shooting up,\u201d complained Admiral Rob Bauer, a nato bigwig, on September 16th.\nThe second issue is timing. \u201cAfter a slow start,\u201d says Mr Connolly, \u201cRussia has reached race pace and they\u2019re in gear now. They\u2019re now going to start churning stuff out at the rate approximating what they need.\u201d American and European investments in new capacity, having started later, will not yield much extra supply until the second half of 2024 or 2025, giving Russia more time to mobilise, build new defences and pin down Ukrainian forces. \nTake the case of artillery shells. The good news is that American and European production is soaring. American officials say that their own output has risen from an annualised rate of 168,000 shells in the spring to 336,000 today. It will continue to rise, thanks both to new facilities and to more intensive use of existing ones. European production is set to double by the end of this year or the start of next, according to Estonia\u2019s defence minister. Between them, America and Europe should comfortably produce nearly 2m shells next year. \nShell shock\nThe trouble is, that is barely enough to keep up. Russia will produce 1m-2m shells next year, according to British estimates. That is on top of a stock of around 5m shells, new and refurbished. That should allow it to fire at least 15,000 rounds a day for a year, says Mr Salm. That is roughly on a par with Ukraine\u2019s heightened consumption during its counter-offensive, according to people familiar with the data. But Ukraine can probably sustain that tempo for only a couple more months.\nThe gap could be bridged by borrowing from elsewhere. Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive was enabled by a massive transfusion of South Korean shells. America and its allies have discreetly purchased arms and ammunition from non-aligned countries such as Egypt and Pakistan on Ukraine\u2019s behalf. But such ready sources of weaponry are running out. Western armies\u2019 stockpiles have been depleted, too.  \nAs the Western arms industry ramps up, this problem should ease. By 2025 there might even be a \u201cglut\u201d of shells, says a Western official. If most of the new output goes to Ukraine, and assuming that neither China nor North Korea bails out Russia, the Ukrainian army might then be able to out-pulverise the Russian army for the first time in the conflict. But 2025 is the military equivalent of a lifetime away. Next year, meanwhile, Ukraine will probably struggle to mount a big offensive. \nThe year after next is also a lifetime away in terms of politics. In Europe, the political winds seem favourable to Ukraine. Polls conducted in June and July showed that 64% of Europeans favour military aid to Ukraine, with strong support not just in countries with a long-standing suspicion of Russia, such as Sweden (93%), but also in more distant member states such as Portugal (90%). \nSome hard-right parties, such as France\u2019s National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, and Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD), cast the conflict as a waste of European resources. \u201cThe German public is paying three times over for this war,\u201d complains Gunnar Lindemann, an AfD member of Berlin\u2019s regional assembly, \u201csupporting 1m refugees, carrying huge energy bills and sending weapons to Ukraine.\u201d Both parties are rising in the polls, but both remain far from power. \nOlaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, has been mindful of anti-war sentiment, notably within his own Social Democratic Party. He dithered for months before agreeing to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine. He still refuses to send long-range Taurus missiles, even though Britain and France have given Ukraine comparable weapons. Yet Mr Scholz has by now realised that public scepticism is mushy: as soon as he sends a new weapon, approval broadly follows. On September 18th his government announced another \u20ac400m ($429m) of arms, including ammunition, armoured vehicles and mine-clearing equipment. \nEmmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, who provoked grumbling in Kyiv last year over his frequent phone calls with Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, and over his hesitation in sending weapons, is now among the most gung-ho of European leaders. France has long resisted expanding the EU, yet Mr Macron has become a fervent supporter of Ukraine\u2019s accession to the bloc. A poll in July showed that 58% of the French backed this approach. \nUkraine\u2019s bid for eu membership is proceeding at a pace that would have astonished Europe-watchers just a few years ago. It formally became a candidate to join in June, 2022. This December, barring a shock, that status will be upgraded by the opening of detailed negotiations on accession. Ukraine is dazzling EU officials with its swift progress on the necessary reforms. It may still take years for Ukraine to become a fully fledged member, but the war seems to be speeding up the process rather than delaying it. \nNow for Congress to get on board\n\nIn America, however, the outlook is much more divided and uncertain. On August 10th the White House asked Congress to authorise another $24bn \u201csupplemental\u201d budget for Ukraine, which would bring total American aid thus far to $135bn. Supporters of such assistance, among both Democrats and Republicans, constitute a clear majority of both chambers of Congress.  Were the request put to a simple up-or-down vote, it would be approved relatively easily.\nBut it is unlikely to be, because of America\u2019s dysfunctional politics. A majority of the members of the House of Representatives may support Ukraine, but a small number of Republicans hold extreme anti-Ukrainian views, including Matt Gaetz, who has proposed inviting Russia to join NATO, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conspiracy theorist who has promoted the absurd notion that aid to Ukraine is actually being siphoned off by donors to the Democrats. Since the Republicans have only a slender majority in the House and since the Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, does not want to rely on Democratic votes to push legislation through, the pro-Russia fringe has much more influence than its numbers would imply.\nThe likeliest course is for Mr McCarthy to attach the supplemental budget to other important legislation, making it harder to derail. Past efforts in the House to deny Ukraine funding have been overcome, although each one attracts more Republican votes. Mr Biden already has congressional approval to send a further $6bn-worth of weapons to Ukraine from existing stockpiles. But after that there is likely to be a delay of several months while Congress contorts itself over the latest request. What emerges may be dribs and drabs of aid, rather than the big packages of last year.\nIn the longer run, aid for Ukraine is fast becoming a partisan issue, which makes its prospects ever less certain. Republican voters, egged on by the scepticism of Donald Trump, their party\u2019s likeliest nominee for president next year, have begun to question further aid to Ukraine. Democrats remain broadly supportive. The big budget deficit and high interest rates make politicians of all parties reluctant to rack up more debt. And even Democrats support the notion that America\u2019s European allies should be the ones taking the initiative in conflicts on their own borders. \nAnd then there is the possibility that Mr Trump wins next year\u2019s election. His policy on Ukraine is characteristically incoherent. In March he promised that he would settle the war in \u201cno longer than one day\u201d, before even entering office. \u201cWe don\u2019t have ammunition for ourselves,\u201d he complained in May, \u201cWe\u2019re giving away so much.\u201d But he denies he would push for a deal allowing Mr Putin to keep Ukrainian territory. \u201cNobody was tougher on Russia than me,\u201d he said this week, insisting he would strike \u201ca fair deal for everybody\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, Western officials worry that Mr Putin will wait to see whether Mr Trump becomes president again before agreeing to negotiations. That scenario is already provoking frenetic debate in Europe. \u201cIf the United States tried to force a negotiated settlement on Ukraine,\u201d argued Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage, a pair of Russia experts, in Foreign Affairs recently,  \u201cEuropeans would have little capacity to resist.\u201d Others say this is unduly fatalistic. French officials argue that, should America end its support for Ukraine, although Europe cannot replace American military aid gun for gun and missile for missile, the prudent and rational thing is for Europe to try to preserve its options by boosting arms manufacturing.\nThe question is whether Europe alone can drum up enough cash and weapons to keep Ukraine going. Although America provided the lion\u2019s share of aid for much of the war, the latest analysis from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think-tank, finds this pattern has reversed. Europeans have long dispensed more financial aid. They are now providing more aid of all sorts, thanks in part to the EU\u2019s recent \u20ac50bn pledge, a multi-year commitment which stretches to 2027 (see chart).\nMoney isn\u2019t everything\nYet the figures do not tell the whole story. America has been the fulcrum of the allied effort to support Ukraine, chairing the regular meetings at which donations of weapons are pledged and co-ordinated at Ramstein, an American military base in Germany. It has provided diplomatic cover for other countries\u2019 aid: Mr Scholz, for instance, insisted that he would not allow German-made Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine unless Mr Biden first sent some American M1A1 Abrams tanks.\nIn some cases Europeans have sent arms to Ukraine on the understanding that they will receive new American weapons to replace the donated ones. America\u2019s security guarantees, underwritten by nuclear weapons, have given Europeans the confidence to stand up to Russian threats. Finally, America has provided vital intelligence that has helped Ukraine find and destroy high-value targets, from generals to warships. Substituting for this organisation and assistance would be a Herculean task.\nIt may be unavoidable. \u201cThe assumption of the West was\u2014and I think everyone has been unspoken on this\u2014was that we give them everything we can, then they will go on this one large offensive and whatever happens at the end of this we will settle for that,\u201d says Mr Salm, the Estonian official. \u201cThat was the plan.\u201d A new one is required, he suggests, involving not just more arms, but also more technology to offset Russia\u2019s advantages in mass, bolder sanctions, such as expulsion from the Paris Olympics, and new training that learns from the mistakes of the summer. \nAbove all, a change in mentality is needed. \u201cThis is exactly what a war of attrition is about: convince the West that we can out-suffer you, we can out-fight you, we can out-last you. They know the weak points of democracies,\u201d Mr Salm says. The task, he believes, is to persuade Mr Putin that the opposite is true. \u201cWe, as the Ramstein coalition, are 25 times richer, stronger and [more] technologically advanced than Russia\u2026It\u2019s not that we are empty-pocketed here.\u201d \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "A lean patch", "section": {"url": {"canonical":

"articleBody": "Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\n\nThe end keeps receding. There was a time when some Ukrainian officials, having halted Russia\u2019s army outside Kyiv, thought it would take only a few more months to bring the war to a conclusion. \u201cMost of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year,\u201d predicted Lieutenant-General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of military intelligence, in May 2022. By last November, shortly after a spectacular Ukrainian offensive in Kharkiv, Volodymyr Havrylov, a deputy defence minister at the time, was still expecting a swift victory. \u201cMy feeling is that by the end of the spring, this war will be over.\u201d \nIn fact, Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive did not even begin until June. Far from hastening the war\u2019s end, it has demonstrated just how long the fighting could drag on. Ukrainian forces, stymied by Russian minefields and other defences, have inched forward on foot. The deployment of reserves and spiffy Western weapons has not yet yielded any big breakthroughs. Wet weather and a shortage of ammunition will probably bring the Ukrainian advance, such as it is, to a halt by late October, if not earlier. \nAnother fighting season beckons. \u201cWe must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine,\u201d warned Jens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary-general, on September 17th. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a considerable length of time to militarily eject all 200,000 or plus Russian troops out of Russian-occupied Ukraine,\u201d agreed Mark Milley, America\u2019s top general, the same day.\nAmerica insists it will stay the course for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d, as Joe Biden, the president, has put it several times this year. Britain, France, Germany and other allies have all used the same phrase. As ironclad as these pledges sound, they depend on two uncertain variables. One is the West\u2019s ability to furnish Ukraine\u2019s army with enough weapons and ammunition. The other is the political will to keep handing them over.\nStart with the first. Russia\u2019s defence industry moved onto a war footing in the last quarter of 2022, says Richard Connolly, an expert on Russia\u2019s economy, who points to a big jump in steel production. British officials say that Russia can now produce around 200 tanks a year, twice as many as they had previously assumed. Mr Connolly says that, with refurbished tanks included, the true figure is probably 500 to 800. Western sanctions are not crimping output much, he adds, with crucial components such as semiconductors smuggled in via Hong Kong or Central Asia.\nIn principle, Ukraine\u2019s friends should have no trouble helping it outgun Russia. The combined GDP of nato\u2019s members is 12 times that of Russia, even after accounting for Russia\u2019s lower prices. The difference is that Russia is willing to spend much more heavily on the war: military spending now takes up almost 40% of the national budget, far in excess of Western levels. NATO countries are trying to redress this imbalance by investing in arms production, which has been neglected since the cold war ended. But there are two snags.\nOne is cost. Estonia spends around $5,000 to $6,000 on every new artillery shell, says Kusti Salm, the senior civil servant in the country\u2019s defence ministry. That is relatively cheap by NATO standards, he notes. Russia, he says, spends 60,000 roubles, or around $620. The vast difference is largely down to cheaper labour and materials, lower quality products and lower profit margins for arms manufacturers, most of which are state-owned. Inflation is exacerbating the problem. \u201cPrices for equipment and ammunition are shooting up,\u201d complained Admiral Rob Bauer, a nato bigwig, on September 16th.\nThe second issue is timing. \u201cAfter a slow start,\u201d says Mr Connolly, \u201cRussia has reached race pace and they\u2019re in gear now. They\u2019re now going to start churning stuff out at the rate approximating what they need.\u201d American and European investments in new capacity, having started later, will not yield much extra supply until the second half of 2024 or 2025, giving Russia more time to mobilise, build new defences and pin down Ukrainian forces. \nTake the case of artillery shells. The good news is that American and European production is soaring. American officials say that their own output has risen from an annualised rate of 168,000 shells in the spring to 336,000 today. It will continue to rise, thanks both to new facilities and to more intensive use of existing ones. European production is set to double by the end of this year or the start of next, according to Estonia\u2019s defence minister. Between them, America and Europe should comfortably produce nearly 2m shells next year. \nShell shock\nThe trouble is, that is barely enough to keep up. Russia will produce 1m-2m shells next year, according to British estimates. That is on top of a stock of around 5m shells, new and refurbished. That should allow it to fire at least 15,000 rounds a day for a year, says Mr Salm. That is roughly on a par with Ukraine\u2019s heightened consumption during its counter-offensive, according to people familiar with the data. But Ukraine can probably sustain that tempo for only a couple more months.\nThe gap could be bridged by borrowing from elsewhere. Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive was enabled by a massive transfusion of South Korean shells. America and its allies have discreetly purchased arms and ammunition from non-aligned countries such as Egypt and Pakistan on Ukraine\u2019s behalf. But such ready sources of weaponry are running out. Western armies\u2019 stockpiles have been depleted, too.  \nAs the Western arms industry ramps up, this problem should ease. By 2025 there might even be a \u201cglut\u201d of shells, says a Western official. If most of the new output goes to Ukraine, and assuming that neither China nor North Korea bails out Russia, the Ukrainian army might then be able to out-pulverise the Russian army for the first time in the conflict. But 2025 is the military equivalent of a lifetime away. Next year, meanwhile, Ukraine will probably struggle to mount a big offensive. \nThe year after next is also a lifetime away in terms of politics. In Europe, the political winds seem favourable to Ukraine. Polls conducted in June and July showed that 64% of Europeans favour military aid to Ukraine, with strong support not just in countries with a long-standing suspicion of Russia, such as Sweden (93%), but also in more distant member states such as Portugal (90%). \nSome hard-right parties, such as France\u2019s National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, and Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD), cast the conflict as a waste of European resources. \u201cThe German public is paying three times over for this war,\u201d complains Gunnar Lindemann, an AfD member of Berlin\u2019s regional assembly, \u201csupporting 1m refugees, carrying huge energy bills and sending weapons to Ukraine.\u201d Both parties are rising in the polls, but both remain far from power. \nOlaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, has been mindful of anti-war sentiment, notably within his own Social Democratic Party. He dithered for months before agreeing to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine. He still refuses to send long-range Taurus missiles, even though Britain and France have given Ukraine comparable weapons. Yet Mr Scholz has by now realised that public scepticism is mushy: as soon as he sends a new weapon, approval broadly follows. On September 18th his government announced another \u20ac400m ($429m) of arms, including ammunition, armoured vehicles and mine-clearing equipment. \nEmmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, who provoked grumbling in Kyiv last year over his frequent phone calls with Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, and over his hesitation in sending weapons, is now among the most gung-ho of European leaders. France has long resisted expanding the EU, yet Mr Macron has become a fervent supporter of Ukraine\u2019s accession to the bloc. A poll in July showed that 58% of the French backed this approach. \nUkraine\u2019s bid for eu membership is proceeding at a pace that would have astonished Europe-watchers just a few years ago. It formally became a candidate to join in June, 2022. This December, barring a shock, that status will be upgraded by the opening of detailed negotiations on accession. Ukraine is dazzling EU officials with its swift progress on the necessary reforms. It may still take years for Ukraine to become a fully fledged member, but the war seems to be speeding up the process rather than delaying it. \nNow for Congress to get on board\n\nIn America, however, the outlook is much more divided and uncertain. On August 10th the White House asked Congress to authorise another $24bn \u201csupplemental\u201d budget for Ukraine, which would bring total American aid thus far to $135bn. Supporters of such assistance, among both Democrats and Republicans, constitute a clear majority of both chambers of Congress.  Were the request put to a simple up-or-down vote, it would be approved relatively easily.\nBut it is unlikely to be, because of America\u2019s dysfunctional politics. A majority of the members of the House of Representatives may support Ukraine, but a small number of Republicans hold extreme anti-Ukrainian views, including Matt Gaetz, who has proposed inviting Russia to join NATO, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conspiracy theorist who has promoted the absurd notion that aid to Ukraine is actually being siphoned off by donors to the Democrats. Since the Republicans have only a slender majority in the House and since the Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, does not want to rely on Democratic votes to push legislation through, the pro-Russia fringe has much more influence than its numbers would imply.\nThe likeliest course is for Mr McCarthy to attach the supplemental budget to other important legislation, making it harder to derail. Past efforts in the House to deny Ukraine funding have been overcome, although each one attracts more Republican votes. Mr Biden already has congressional approval to send a further $6bn-worth of weapons to Ukraine from existing stockpiles. But after that there is likely to be a delay of several months while Congress contorts itself over the latest request. What emerges may be dribs and drabs of aid, rather than the big packages of last year.\nIn the longer run, aid for Ukraine is fast becoming a partisan issue, which makes its prospects ever less certain. Republican voters, egged on by the scepticism of Donald Trump, their party\u2019s likeliest nominee for president next year, have begun to question further aid to Ukraine. Democrats remain broadly supportive. The big budget deficit and high interest rates make politicians of all parties reluctant to rack up more debt. And even Democrats support the notion that America\u2019s European allies should be the ones taking the initiative in conflicts on their own borders. \nAnd then there is the possibility that Mr Trump wins next year\u2019s election. His policy on Ukraine is characteristically incoherent. In March he promised that he would settle the war in \u201cno longer than one day\u201d, before even entering office. \u201cWe don\u2019t have ammunition for ourselves,\u201d he complained in May, \u201cWe\u2019re giving away so much.\u201d But he denies he would push for a deal allowing Mr Putin to keep Ukrainian territory. \u201cNobody was tougher on Russia than me,\u201d he said this week, insisting he would strike \u201ca fair deal for everybody\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, Western officials worry that Mr Putin will wait to see whether Mr Trump becomes president again before agreeing to negotiations. That scenario is already provoking frenetic debate in Europe. \u201cIf the United States tried to force a negotiated settlement on Ukraine,\u201d argued Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage, a pair of Russia experts, in Foreign Affairs recently,  \u201cEuropeans would have little capacity to resist.\u201d Others say this is unduly fatalistic. French officials argue that, should America end its support for Ukraine, although Europe cannot replace American military aid gun for gun and missile for missile, the prudent and rational thing is for Europe to try to preserve its options by boosting arms manufacturing.\nThe question is whether Europe alone can drum up enough cash and weapons to keep Ukraine going. Although America provided the lion\u2019s share of aid for much of the war, the latest analysis from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think-tank, finds this pattern has reversed. Europeans have long dispensed more financial aid. They are now providing more aid of all sorts, thanks in part to the EU\u2019s recent \u20ac50bn pledge, a multi-year commitment which stretches to 2027 (see chart).\nMoney isn\u2019t everything\nYet the figures do not tell the whole story. America has been the fulcrum of the allied effort to support Ukraine, chairing the regular meetings at which donations of weapons are pledged and co-ordinated at Ramstein, an American military base in Germany. It has provided diplomatic cover for other countries\u2019 aid: Mr Scholz, for instance, insisted that he would not allow German-made Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine unless Mr Biden first sent some American M1A1 Abrams tanks.\nIn some cases Europeans have sent arms to Ukraine on the understanding that they will receive new American weapons to replace the donated ones. America\u2019s security guarantees, underwritten by nuclear weapons, have given Europeans the confidence to stand up to Russian threats. Finally, America has provided vital intelligence that has helped Ukraine find and destroy high-value targets, from generals to warships. Substituting for this organisation and assistance would be a Herculean task.\nIt may be unavoidable. \u201cThe assumption of the West was\u2014and I think everyone has been unspoken on this\u2014was that we give them everything we can, then they will go on this one large offensive and whatever happens at the end of this we will settle for that,\u201d says Mr Salm, the Estonian official. \u201cThat was the plan.\u201d A new one is required, he suggests, involving not just more arms, but also more technology to offset Russia\u2019s advantages in mass, bolder sanctions, such as expulsion from the Paris Olympics, and new training that learns from the mistakes of the summer. \nAbove all, a change in mentality is needed. \u201cThis is exactly what a war of attrition is about: convince the West that we can out-suffer you, we can out-fight you, we can out-last you. They know the weak points of democracies,\u201d Mr Salm says. The task, he believes, is to persuade Mr Putin that the opposite is true. \u201cWe, as the Ramstein coalition, are 25 times richer, stronger and [more] technologically advanced than Russia\u2026It\u2019s not that we are empty-pocketed here.\u201d \u25a0", "description": "There is a shortage of weapons and munitions\u2014and, in some quarters, goodwill", "ogDescription": "There is a shortage of weapons and munitions\u2014and, in some quarters, goodwill", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230923_FBP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-09-21T10:38:27Z", "dateModified": "2023-09-21T12:51:48Z", "dateCreated": "2023-09-20T10:55:34Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-09-23T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/e4olb392cfef30qkihtvtnms801edpp4", "publication": [{"id": "/content/q7kadojabt8mqss3838etdaslph43q0e", "context": {"position": 400.13, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3et857aqlkhdb2sjdnaq7cvei52kc0nl", "context": {"position": 400.13, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/kpr5l6d6d2j464ou5bf62rm0rna9vsg6", "context": {"position": 400.13, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4bq6lktc4ae95v69i85aafs6o870pm2u", "context": {"position": 400.13, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/34hc4rj8qmujur479tl3n4os4616096t", "context": {"position": 400.13, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/dg3g5stcnd95p2l8a25396rfsk62i042", "context": {"position": 400.13, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/lh3aotm59vn5ps1hsnk8t7er5gp3uts5", "context": {"position": 400.13, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/9rk0h3dl3sggbqj9nis863hduia265ve", "context": {"position": 400.13, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Western help for Ukraine is likely to diminish next year", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/western-help-for-ukraine-is-likely-to-diminish-next-year", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ppv93sn16mkmpo0os26ioqogg623s8kn", "publication": [{"id": "/content/q7kadojabt8mqss3838etdaslph43q0e", "context": {"position": 400.12, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3et857aqlkhdb2sjdnaq7cvei52kc0nl", "context": {"position": 400.12, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/kpr5l6d6d2j464ou5bf62rm0rna9vsg6", "context": {"position": 400.12, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4bq6lktc4ae95v69i85aafs6o870pm2u", "context": {"position": 400.12, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/34hc4rj8qmujur479tl3n4os4616096t", "context": {"position": 400.12, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/dg3g5stcnd95p2l8a25396rfsk62i042", "context": {"position": 400.12, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/lh3aotm59vn5ps1hsnk8t7er5gp3uts5", "context": {"position": 400.12, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/9rk0h3dl3sggbqj9nis863hduia265ve", "context": {"position": 400.12, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "To endure a long war, Ukraine is remaking its army, economy and society", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/21/to-endure-a-long-war-ukraine-is-remaking-its-army-economy-and-society", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
