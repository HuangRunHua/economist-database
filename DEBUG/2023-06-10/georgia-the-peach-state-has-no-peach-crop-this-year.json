States", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/08/georgia-the-peach-state-has-no-peach-crop-this-year", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "On a Monday in March Robert Dickey went to bed feeling sick to his stomach. After a few tropical weeks the temperature was dropping, and when it got numbingly cold, he knew that his thousand acres of blooming peach trees would be icy by morning. \nThis year 90% of Georgia\u2019s peach crop was destroyed by the freeze\u2014an unusually balmy winter meant trees blossomed early, only for spring frosts to kill the flowers. The trio of orchards in middle Georgia, that grow 95% of the state\u2019s peaches, typically ship more than 150m peaches to grocery stores. This summer trees are bare and no commercial trucks are being packed. The last time the farmers lost an entire crop was in 1955. \nThough the peach is a fussy plant to begin with\u2014a characteristic that awards successful growers prestige in husbandry circles\u2014climate change is giving farmers conniptions. In order to bear fruit, peach trees need 600 to 1,000 \u201cchill hours\u201d a year, when temperatures drop below 45\u00b0F (7\u00b0C). But winter averages have been climbing in Georgia and since 2016 crisp nights have become rare. \nHorticulturists are experimenting with spraying early buds with insulating goo to shield them from spring freezes and farmers are planting varieties that require less cold. Switching to pecans and strawberries (both far less temperamental crops) and chopping down timber helps growers get by. \nYou might expect such a devastating harvest to bode badly for Georgia\u2019s economy. In fact, the Peach State has a perplexingly small market for stone fruit. Cotton, peanuts and corn each bring in far more revenue. (Peaches generated $34m in 2022; cotton $1.4bn.) Nor is Georgia the main domestic supplier of peaches. Last year California dominated the market and South Carolina took second place. Why, then, does the fruit loom so large in the state\u2019s identity?\nBefore the Civil War peaches grew wild on plantations and roadsides. On the eve of Reconstruction, with slavery scrapped and the Southern economy in shambles, businessmen were looking to rebrand themselves to attract Northern investment. Cotton-growing stank of the Confederacy, but peaches were sweet. Soon Georgians took to growing them. Since spring came earlier down South, farmers could get fruit to the New York market before others, and buyers paid a premium for that. Yankee investors got hooked on the yellow, meaty Elberta variety, newly bred in Georgia, and by the 1920s refrigerated railcars hauled fruit north. Newspapers declared that \u201cqueen peach\u201d had \u201cdethroned king cotton\u201d. \nAs a cultural marketing ploy the peach was a hit, says Tom Okie, a historian at Kennesaw State University. By the 1950s images of the fuzzy fruit were on licence plates, peach festivals drew crowds and men called women they fancied \u201cGeorgia peaches\u201d. The fruit symbolised a progressive, sophisticated and economically open new South. \nThe peach harvest was always unpredictable, but as demand grew it became harder to promise stock to merchants. Farmers in the milder California valley offered more consistency. Profits in the Southeast fell. According to farm records, in 1885 Georgia farmers sold peaches for $15 a bushel. Though that is nearly $500 in today\u2019s dollars, farmers claim they now struggle to charge $15.\nPam Knox, a climatologist at the University of Georgia, says that orchards should be fuller next summer, since an El Ni\u00f1o cool phase is headed to the Southeast. But farmers see every year as a gamble, with the odds getting a tad worse each play. The occasional bumper crop fuels addiction. \u201cA year like this makes me want to double down,\u201d says Lawton Pearson, a fifth-generation peach farmer who vows to never walk away. \u201cThat\u2019s the drug, that next year will be better.\u201d \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of
