conference in Cupertino, California. The new gadget, which is controlled by hand gestures, voice commands and eye movements, is pitched as a leap forward in \u201cspatial computing\u201d. When it hits the market next year it will cost $3,499. Pricey, too, are shares in the technology giant, which hit an all-time high on the day of the announcement, nudging the firm\u2019s market capitalisation close to $3trn.\nPutting differences aside\nA merger announced between PGA Tour, DP World Tour and LIV Golf marked the end of a bitter schism in golf. LIV was launched last year by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund, luring star players away from the sport\u2019s traditional tournaments with big cheques. The deal will end legal disputes between the groups and give the Gulf state another controversial foothold in global sport.\nChinese exports slumped by more than expected in May, fuelling fears that the country\u2019s economic recovery is losing steam.
