"https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/06/07/kim-darroch-on-the-special-relationship-between-america-and-britain", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "RISHI SUNAK is in Washington this week. The centrepiece is the British prime minister\u2019s meeting with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office. But he will also meet other senior politicians and business leaders, and attend a game of the local Major League baseball team, the Washington Nationals. It had been rumoured that Mr Sunak would throw the ceremonial first pitch, but it now appears he will not have the honour. That may, in fact, come as a relief: celebrity pitching is fraught with risk, as Barack Obama discovered in 2010, when he threw so high and wide that those in the crowd who weren\u2019t laughing jeered. \nMore seriously, the run-up to Mr Sunak\u2019s visit has seen another round of British soul-searching about the state of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. Not so in the American press: there is some curiosity about yet another new British prime-ministerial face, but to stateside scribblers it is largely just another visit, another leader kissing the ring of the leader of the free world. \nThis is not to dismiss some aspects of the relationship that are genuinely special. The two countries\u2019 defence and intelligence establishments are extraordinarily close, and work together whoever is in Downing Street and the White House. But if I had to sum up in a single adjective how the British eternally feel about the special relationship, it would be \u201canxious\u201d. For the Americans, the word would be \u201cunsentimental\u201d. In Washington we get an audience when we are contributing, whether ideas or leverage or boots on the ground. When we are bound up with our domestic troubles, the American response will often be polite but essentially disengaged. When we cross America, the reaction can be brutal.\nIndeed, the history of the special relationship contains as many troughs as peaks. In 1956 Dwight Eisenhower condemned the Suez invasion by Britain, France and Israel and forced a withdrawal, reportedly telling his aides that \u201cthose who began this operation should be left to boil in their own oil.\u201d Harold Wilson and Lyndon Johnson had a famously poor relationship, in part because of Wilson\u2019s refusal to contribute British troops to America\u2019s war in Vietnam; Johnson once privately described Wilson as \u201ca little creep\u201d. \nTheir respective successors, Edward Heath and Richard Nixon, were similarly distant, with Nixon convinced that Heath was prioritising British negotiations to join the European Communities (as the EU was then known) over relations with America. Nixon became so frustrated that he once said to Henry Kissinger: \u201cNo special relations\u2026They\u2019ll have the relations with the French.\u201d \nSome 20 years later John Major refused for weeks to take a telephone call from Bill Clinton because of the president\u2019s decision to allow Gerry Adams, a Northern Irish republican politician, a visa to visit America. And even the peaks had hollows: Ronald Reagan\u2019s decision to invade Grenada, a Commonwealth country, blindsided Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair failed to persuade George Bush to follow British advice on how to manage the aftermath of the Iraq war.\nOn the atmospherics, Mr Sunak ought now to be comfortable with Mr Biden. They have met several times. And the prime minister is almost an American: he worked in that country\u2019s financial sector and (however much he would like less-well-heeled British voters to forget this) owns property in California. \nAs for policy, he has two achievements which should merit some respect from across the table. On Ukraine, Britain has provided the most military support of any European state\u2014albeit only about a tenth of what America has given. It has also been first mover on some of the more controversial Ukrainian requests, notably tanks. And with the \u201cWindsor framework\u201d, Mr Sunak has got as complete a solution as is currently possible to the problems surrounding the Northern Ireland Protocol\u2014an issue that Mr Biden, with his Irish roots, was watching closely.\nSo they shouldn\u2019t need to spend any time on Brexit issues\u2014though Mr Biden, like every Democrat I\u2019ve ever met, will continue to think that Brexit has damaged both Britain and the EU. It has also complicated the Americans\u2019 diplomatic playbook: the harsh reality for Britain is that it is much less useful to America as a channel through which to track and try to influence EU policymaking than it was before Brexit.\nThe Russia/Ukraine discussion, doubtless focused on the Ukrainian counter-offensive that began this week, should be positive and productive. The two leaders will indulge in mutual congratulation on AUKUS, a security pact between America, Britain and Australia, which will add another dimension to the defence relationship. On China, while a comparison of a recent speech by Britain\u2019s foreign secretary with recent pronouncements from the Biden administration would suggest some divergence, I suspect views in reality are closer. The Americans share British objectives on China: both want to challenge its behaviour in its neighbourhood, its support for Russia and its unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property, while looking for a way to work with it on climate change. \nAway from geopolitics, Mr Sunak is keen to interest Mr Biden in his ideas about new international structures to regulate artificial intelligence. As sound and rational as these ideas may be, however, they are likely to be swamped should America decide to work something out with the EU.\nFor all the inevitable smiles and pats on the back this week, there doesn\u2019t look to be much real warmth in the Anglo-American relationship at the moment. Mr Sunak took some political risks to deliver the Windsor framework, but there didn\u2019t seem much appreciation from across the Atlantic. Rather the contrary: in a recent speech Mr Biden said that his visit to Ireland in April was to ensure \u201cthe Brits didn\u2019t screw around\u201d in following up the Windsor deal. It\u2019s as if there has been no real reset in relations from the Johnson era and the Truss moment to the age of Sunak.
