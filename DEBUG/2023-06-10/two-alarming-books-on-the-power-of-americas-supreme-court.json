"type": "Article", "articleBody": "The Supermajority. By Michael Waldman. Simon & Schuster; 400 pages; $29.99\nThe Shadow Docket. By Stephen Vladeck. Basic Books; 352 pages; $30\nThe Supreme Court of the United States did not start out as the powerful, at times imperious, institution of today. Under the Articles of Confederation of 1777, there were no federal courts at all. The third branch added by the constitution in 1789 was, at first, something of a third wheel. The justices met in the basement of the Capitol when the government moved to the District of Columbia in 1800. Congress paid the Supreme Court little courtesy, sending justices to \u201cride circuit\u201d over the summer and even cancelling their term from April 1802 to February 1803.\nLater that year, however, John Marshall, the fourth chief justice, boldly seized the power of judicial review\u2014the ability to strike down laws that violate the constitution. A century and a quarter later, the tenth chief, William Howard Taft, insisted on liberating the justices from Congress\u2019s lair and installing them in a spectacular home of their own across the road. \nThe emboldened jurists now calling the shots in Taft\u2019s \u201cmarble palace\u201d\u2014the bronze front doors of which stand 17 feet (five metres) high and weigh six and a half tons apiece\u2014are the cast of two new books. \u201cThe Supermajority\u201d by Michael Waldman, head of the Brennan Centre for Justice at New York University, analyses the seismic effects of rulings made last year. \u201cThe Shadow Docket\u201d by Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, is the first book to pull back the curtain on the less visible (but increasingly influential) way the court is twisting the constitution in the shadows. Both authors aim to alarm.\nMr Waldman\u2019s focus is on the court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority. Republican appointees have dominated the court since 1970, but in recapping three decisions of June 2022, \u201cThe Supermajority\u201d shows that the rightward lean has gone full tilt. Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organisation abandoned rulings that for half a century provided a constitutional right to abortion. Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s approach in his majority opinion preserves \u201cin amber 19th-century social norms\u201d, says Mr Waldman.\nHe also lambasts the supermajority for its extreme interpretation of the right to keep and bear arms. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v Bruen, Justice Clarence Thomas ignored \u201coverwhelming evidence throughout history\u201d that \u201cprohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were just fine\u201d. And by striking down a plan to restrict greenhouse-gas emissions in West Virginia v Environmental Protection Agency, the court \u201chobbled\u201d the government\u2019s ability to deal with climate change.\nCasting aside precedents and revolutionising the law on contentious questions may be brazen, Mr Waldman notes, but it has happened before. In three other periods, the court \u201cdivided America\u201d: the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 paved the way for civil war; rulings in the early 20th century blocked worker reforms, including (for some time) the New Deal; and the liberal Warren Court of the 1950s and 1960s triggered a conservative backlash.\nThese historical sections in the book are thin; its analysis of the Warren Court, in particular, could be sharper. Mr Waldman writes that this period, with its expansion of rights in America, was the court\u2019s \u201cgreatest era\u201d\u2014yet he also criticises its justices for \u201cmaking up rights to fit their political predilections\u201d. Somewhat implausibly, he implies that conservatives might have been less upset if decisions on contraception, abortion and criminal justice had been couched in less \u201cgroovy\u201d and \u201cpsychedelic\u201d terms. \nThe history that Mr Vladeck recounts is more nuanced, as well as being attuned to the argument of his book: that the court has damaged its legitimacy in abusing its \u201cshadow\u201d, or emergency, docket. \u201cMost of what the court does is behind the scenes,\u201d he explains, and \u201cshrouded in obscurity\u201d.\nThe term \u201cshadow docket\u201d dates only to 2015 but the concept\u2014any decision made without oral argument and, typically, with scant explanation and few justices disclosing how they voted\u2014is as old as the Supreme Court. Until 2017 shadow-docket affairs were \u201calmost entirely uncontroversial\u201d. That changed when Donald Trump\u2019s administration stretched the concept of \u201cemergency\u201d by regularly running to the justices. Across the four previous presidential terms, solicitors-general filed just eight emergency applications. Mr Trump\u2019s officials filed 41. The court was mostly obliging, granting at least part of his wishes\u2014such as to divert funds to his security wall, ban travellers from Muslim countries and execute federal prisoners\u201428 times.\nThe dark side\nMr Vladeck offers a fascinating chronicle of the shadow docket\u2019s rise. He traces it to 1890, when the court gained more discretion over its regular docket and \u201cinaugurated the practice of offering no explanation\u201d when it declined to hear a case. The next step was a surge in last-minute execution appeals (a \u201cdeath clerk\u201d had to be nominated to handle the applications). A prototype of Mr Vladeck\u2019s critique came in 1984 when Justice William Brennan dissented from a 5-4 decision to reinstate an execution. He called it \u201can indefensible\u2014and unexplained\u2014rush to judgment\u201d that was \u201cinsensitive, if not ghoulish\u201d.\nThe author\u2019s skill as a law professor shines in thorough, clear explanations of how the court has run roughshod over its own jurisprudence in shadow-docket cases involving abortion, religious liberty and election law. He highlights the silent but \u201cstunningly impactful\u201d role Justice Amy Coney Barrett played in her first weeks on the job. She added a fifth vote in favour of religious objections to pandemic public-health measures which, four months earlier, had been rejected by the left-leaning justices and Chief Justice John Roberts.\nWhereas Mr Waldman\u2019s case rests on substantive disagreements with the justices, Mr Vladeck\u2019s is more even-handed. He praises an order he disagreed with for being \u201cby the book\u201d in terms of procedure, and faults another he liked for failing to include a reasoned explanation. He also notes recent signs of wiser use of the shadow docket as some justices respond to outside criticism (not least, though he takes no credit, from Mr Vladeck himself).\nReining in the court will be tricky. Mr Waldman\u2019s insistence that left-leaning Americans \u201cmust fall out of love with the Supreme Court\u201d is odd, as three-quarters of Democrats already hate it. He is cheered by signs of a backlash to Dobbs, but does not show how this sentiment might lead to judicial term limits, one of his proposed reforms (the justices themselves could anyway strike those down, as he acknowledges). In shining a light on a tenebrous corner of the court\u2019s work, Mr Vladeck\u2019s agenda looks more modest. But the illumination in \u201cThe Shadow Docket\u201d could help bring more principle, accountability and \u201cprocedural regularity\u201d to the justices\u2019 work\u2014and help stop a controversial institution going completely off the rails. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only
