Deep shifts are also taking place at Europe\u2019s historic core. After a tricky spell, the leaders of France and Germany are trying to work out what all this means for their own countries, and their ability to overcome differences between them.\nAt least symbolically, a Franco-German reset is now under way. On June 6th Olaf Scholz hosted Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, in Potsdam, where the German chancellor lives. The pair strolled around the pretty town together, and dined for nearly three hours. It is part of an effort to put behind them a period of mutual irritation. Things reached a low point last autumn, when France cancelled a joint cabinet meeting. That has now taken place. And the Germans have invited Mr Macron for a full state visit in July, the first one laid on for a French president in 23 years.\nEach country is facing a challenge to its underlying tenets. For Germany, the war has upended the foundations of its post-war economic model, based on cheap Russian energy and exports to China. The country has weaned itself off Russian gas. For decades uneasy about the notion of muscular power, Germany has also become a generous military supplier to Ukraine. It is spending an extra \u20ac100bn ($107bn) on rearming. It may take time for the Zeitenwende (\u201chistoric turning-point\u201d) to take  effect; but Germany is changing.\nFor France, the shift is less visible, but no less profound. It is less about the country\u2019s economic model, which is not as export-dependent as Germany\u2019s. Nor, thanks to nuclear power, was it as reliant on Russian gas. Rather, France is rethinking European borders, alliances and security. Traditionally unenthusiastic about expanding the EU, France used to treat central and eastern European countries as juniors. In 2003 Jacques Chirac, then president, dismissed the support of aspiring EU member countries from eastern Europe for America\u2019s invasion of Iraq (which France opposed), declaring that they had \u201cmissed an opportunity to shut up\u201d. As recently as 2019 France vetoed opening EU membership talks with Albania and North Macedonia. \nRussia\u2019s war has hastened a structural shift. One element is fresh French support for EU expansion. On a trip to Kyiv last June, Mr Macron backed Ukraine and Moldova for EU candidate status. France has lifted its veto on Albania\u2019s and North Macedonia\u2019s membership bids. On May 31st in a speech in Slovakia, Mr Macron declared, to much surprise, that EU enlargement should take place \u201cas fast as possible\u201d. \u201cThe question for us is not whether we should enlarge,\u201d he said, \u201cbut how we should do it.\u201d In a nod to Chirac, Mr Macron confessed to the largely central and eastern European audience there: \u201cWe have sometimes missed an opportunity to listen.\u201d\nSuch statements have helped reassure those who feared Mr Macron\u2019s idea of a wider European Political Community was also a ploy to stall EU expansion. Designed to bring together 44 EU and neighbouring countries twice-yearly, this confab met for the second time on June 1st in Moldova\u2014just 20km (13 miles) from the Ukrainian border. With Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, present, the summit was a show of unity for his war-battered country as well as a boost for the host, Moldova. France now sees EU borders extending farther to the east. Russian territorial revisionism, recently wrote Alexandre Adam, a former Europe adviser to Mr Macron, has made enlargement a \u201cgeopolitical necessity\u2026there is no longer a stable grey zone possible between the Union and Russia.\u201d \nThe second French shift concerns security. Mr Macron wants Europe to do more to defend itself and to rely less on America, especially ahead of elections there in 2024. Fellow Europeans still fear that such talk will undermine America\u2019s commitment to European security. The continent\u2019s new geopolitics, however, seem to be making France more hawkish. In Bratislava Mr Macron called for Ukraine to be given a \u201cpath to NATO membership\u201d at the alliance\u2019s summit in Vilnius in July. This is quite a turnaround for a leader who in 2019 told The Economist that NATO was undergoing \u201cbrain death\u201d, and who remains uneasy about its playing any role outside Europe.\nThere are now serious conversations taking place in France about how to give Ukraine robust and credible security guarantees. On June 19th defence ministers will meet in Paris to discuss European air defences and \u201cdeep-strike\u201d capability. Mr Macron has even offered to hold a dialogue on the French nuclear deterrent.\nAs Germany and France each work out how to shape and adapt to a new Europe, their discussions will be fraught with difficulties. One taciturn and cautious, the other grandiose and risk-taking, the two leaders struggle to read each other. The pair are now aligned on enlargement, but there are tough discussions going on over new rules for the EU\u2019s internal workings, a prelude to further enlargement. Differences over nuclear energy, defence procurement and fiscal rules remain. Germany, like America, remains cautious about Ukraine and NATO. It is exasperated by Mr Macron\u2019s periodic outspokenness. France is frustrated by the confusion and slowness of Mr Scholz\u2019s governing coalition. \nRussia\u2019s war on Ukraine has taught Europeans that their continent\u2019s organisation, in any guise, is far broader than the link between Paris and Berlin. These days Germany spends less time than it did fretting about France. France is keener than before to reach out to other countries within the EU. Still, little gets done in the bloc unless France and Germany can agree. As a rule, they differ on most issues, but share the will to overcome those differences. Their ability to do so will be crucial to defining the shape of this new Europe. \u25a0", "description": "It is prompting a big shift in France and Germany", "ogDescription": "It is prompting a big
