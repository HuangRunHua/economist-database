Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/08/japan-offers-ukraine-a-lesson-in-reconstruction", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Kobe, in western Japan, is best known for its marbled beef. But feasting on the delicacy was not what brought Igor Korkhovyi to town last month. At an auditorium in the city centre, he and a group of other officials from Ukraine tucked into a day of meetings and lectures. \u201cWe should learn from your experience,\u201d he told the region\u2019s governor. \nJapan\u2019s armed forces, which have not fired a shot in combat since 1945, have little to teach Ukraine\u2019s battle-hardened warriors. Yet Japan has plenty of useful lessons to impart when it comes to weathering disasters and rebuilding in their wake. The second world war devastated many Japanese cities, including Tokyo. While visiting for the G7 summit last month, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, remarked on the resemblance between the \u201cruins of our cities\u201d and the pictures he saw of Hiroshima after the atomic bombing. Natural hazards, from earthquakes to typhoons to floods, are also common in Japan. The north-eastern region of Tohoku suffered from an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown in 2011. Much of the country\u2019s disaster-management system traces back to the experience of Kobe\u2019s devastating earthquake in 1995. \u201cOut of some successes and many failures, we learned some lessons,\u201d explains Matsunaga Hideki of the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA), Japan\u2019s overseas-development body. \nFor Ukrainians, Japan is therefore a study in resilience. \u201cJapan is a country living in permanent recovery,\u201d says Mr Korkhovyi of Ukraine\u2019s Ministry for Communities, Territories and Infrastructure Development. \u201cHow have they made this miracle? How can that approach be used or modified in Ukraine?\u201d Sergiy Korsunsky, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Japan, recently published a book in Ukrainian called \u201cHow Nations are Reborn: The Experience of East Asia\u201d, which explores those questions, studying the experiences of China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. \nThree lessons stand out. The first involves prioritising people during reconstruction\u2014infrastructure is worthless unless communities return to use it. The second is the importance of seizing the opportunity inherent in a blank slate. \u201cDon\u2019t rebuild the old, build anew,\u201d says Mr Korsunsky. Thinking ahead is also essential. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is not just money\u2014you have to plan,\u201d he concludes. Ukraine should start that now. \u201cWhen the war is finished, we\u2019ll have no time for planning\u2014everything has to be done in parallel,\u201d Mr Korkhovyi says.\nUkrainian leaders would still prefer arms to urban plans. But Japanese law bars sending lethal aid (though some in Japan\u2019s ruling party want to change that). So the government has focused on the financial and humanitarian sort. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think-tank, Japan\u2019s total assistance to Ukraine comes to $6.7bn. As a share of GDP, that is a third of what America and Britain have given; but it is far more than other Asian democracies that have aligned themselves with Ukraine, such as Australia and South Korea. \nStudy tours like the trip JICA arranged for Mr Korkhovyi and other officials from across Ukraine are part of the package. Mr Korkhovyi marvelled at Japan\u2019s underground electrical substations. \u201cIf Ukraine had such substations in big cities, we\u2019d avoid disruptions from drone attacks on critical infrastructure,\u201d he mused. He also asked his hosts for copies of Japanese regulations related to the disposal of rubble from buildings destroyed by earthquakes, which could be applied to those flattened by bombs. Serhii Koreniev, the deputy mayor of Mykolaiv, a city in Ukraine\u2019s south that struggled to provide fresh water after shelling disrupted its pipe network, found much to praise in the water management of Kobe. It constructed an innovative system of water pipes and reservoirs after suffering similar disruptions during the earthquake.\nSuch measures could indirectly help Ukraine fend off attacks and the environmental crises they can trigger, such as the flooding caused by the destruction of a dam in the country\u2019s south this week. They will also be essential after the fighting ends. Ukraine will have to live with constant risk\u2014in the form of its threatening neighbour. That will mean building cities and fostering communities that are ready for the worst\u2014a bitter lesson Japan had to learn. As Valentyna Poliakova of Ukraine\u2019s State Agency for Restoration and Infrastructure Development puts it: \u201cWe need to think of Russia as a natural disaster, like they do a tsunami or earthquake in Japan.\u201d \u25a0\nRead more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia:\nThe strange tale of a prominent North Korean defector (Jun 1st)\nAmerica is lavishing attention on Pacific island
