He relied a bit too heavily on the artificial-intelligence (AI) chatbot. It created a motion replete with made-up cases, rulings and quotes, which Mr Schwartz promptly filed after the bot assured him that the \u201ccases I provided are real and can be found in reputable legal databases\u201d (they were not, and cannot). Lesson learned, a tech-sceptic lawyer might conclude: the old ways are the best.\nThat is the wrong lesson. Blaming AI for Mr Schwartz\u2019s error-filled brief makes no more sense than blaming the printing press for mistakes in a typed one. In both cases, fault lies with the lawyer who failed to check the motion before filing it, not the tool that helped produce it. For that is what AI is: neither a fad nor an apocalypse, but a tool in its infancy\u2014and one that could radically change how lawyers work and law firms make money. The legal profession is hardly the only field about which one could say that. But few combine as clear a use case with so high a risk. Firms that get it right stand to reap rewards. Laggards risk going the way of typesetters.\nAccording to a recent report from Goldman Sachs, a bank, 44% of legal tasks could be performed by AI, more than in any occupation surveyed except for clerical and administrative support. Lawyers spend an awful lot of time scrutinising tedious documents\u2014the sort of thing that AI has already demonstrated it can do well. Lawyers use AI for a variety of tasks, including due diligence, research and data analytics. These applications have largely relied on \u201cextractive\u201d AI, which, as the name suggests, extracts information from a text, answering specific questions about its contents. \n\u201cGenerative\u201d AIs such as ChatGPT are far more powerful. Part of that power can be used to improve legal research and document review. As Pablo Arredondo, creator of a generative-AI \u201clegal assistant\u201d called CoCounsel, explains, using it \u201cremoves the tyranny of the keyword\u2026It can tell that \u2018We reverse Jenkins\u2019 [a fictional legal case] and \u2018We regretfully consign Jenkins to the dustbin of history\u2019 are the same thing.\u201d Allen & Overy, a large firm based in London, has integrated a legal AI tool called Harvey into its practice, using it for contract analysis, due diligence and litigation prep. \nNot all lawyers are convinced. One recent survey found that 82% of them believe generative AI can be used for legal work but just 51% thought it should. Many worry about \u201challucinations\u201d (as AI boffins refer to chatbots\u2019 tendency to present falsehoods with aplomb, as in Mr Schwartz\u2019s case) and about inadvertently feeding information subject to attorney-client privilege into algorithms. Yet if these challenges can be tackled\u2014and they can, with better technology and careful humans in the loop\u2014then the misgivings of the doubting 49% may pass. After news of Mr Schwartz\u2019s debacle broke, for example, a federal judge in Texas told attorneys appearing before him to file a certificate attesting that they either did not use generative AI at all or that, if they did, they checked the final result. Much as it made little sense for lawyers to insist on doing legal research in libraries once the vastly larger and more easily searched databases of Westlaw and LexisNexis were a click away, when a critical mass of firms embraces generative AI, more will follow. \nAI has the potential to transform the legal profession in three big ways. First, it could reduce big firms\u2019 manpower advantage. In large, complex lawsuits, these firms tell dozens of associates to read millions of pages of documents looking for answers to senior lawyers\u2019 questions and hunches. Now a single lawyer or small firm will be able to upload these documents into a litigation-prep AI and begin querying them. As Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School notes, \u201cYou can be a smaller, leaner specialised firm and have the capacity to process these sorts of cases.\u201d\nBillable powers\nSecond, AI could change how firms make money. Richard Susskind, technology adviser to the Lord Chief Justice of England, argues that firms profit by \u201chaving armies of young lawyers to whom they pay less than they charge clients\u201d. If AI can do the work of those armies in seconds, firms will need to change their billing practices. Some may move to charging flat fees based on the service provided, rather than for the amount of time spent providing it. Stephen Wu of Silicon Valley Law Group speculates that firms may charge \u201ca technology fee\u201d, so that \u201cclients don\u2019t expect to get generative AI for nothing\u201d. \nThird, AI could change how many lawyers exist and where they work. Eventually, Mr Lessig argues, it is hard to see how AI \u201cdoesn\u2019t dramatically reduce the number of lawyers the world needs\u201d. If AI can do in 20 seconds a task that would have taken a dozen associates 50 hours each, then why would big firms continue hiring dozens of associates? A veteran partner at a prestigious corporate-law firm in New York expects the ratio of associates to partners to decline from today\u2019s average of perhaps seven to one at the top firms to closer to parity. If associates aren\u2019t worried about their jobs, he says, \u201cthey should be\u201d.\nThat may not happen for a while, however. Moreover, AI could make legal services cheaper and thus more widely available, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses that currently often struggle to afford them. Ambitious law-school graduates may find that AI provides an easier path to starting a solo practice. If so, then AI could actually lead to an increase in the overall number of lawyers, as well as changing the sort of tasks they perform\u2014just as the ATM led to an increase in the number of human bank employees rather than their replacement.\nUltimately this will be good news for clients. \u201cPeople who go to lawyers don\u2019t want lawyers: they want resolutions to their problems or the avoidance of problems altogether,\u201d explains Mr Susskind. If AI can provide those outcomes then people will use AI. Many people already use software to do their taxes rather than rely on professionals; \u201cVery few of them are complaining about the lack of social interaction with their tax advisers.\u201d
