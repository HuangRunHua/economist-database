"THIS WEEK there have been frequent comparisons between D-Day in 1944 and the Ukrainian military offensive that is currently unfolding. Although both were launched in the month of June, a better comparison may be to Operation Cobra, a large ground operation launched by the United States First Army almost two months after the Normandy landings. While starting inauspiciously, with the accidental killing of Leslie McNair, an American lieutenant-general, and unfolding slowly at first, once the operation gathered pace it was highly effective. It was Cobra that broke open German defences for the Allies to exploit in subsequent offensives.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky, his armed forces and their supporters in the West will be hoping for something similar. They need a decisive campaign that not only recaptures swathes of Ukrainian territory but also destroys a significant part of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine so they cannot conduct offensive operations again in 2023. The best case would see all of Ukraine liberated this year. The most likely is that large parts of the east and south of the country are liberated, placing Ukraine in a good strategic position to regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\nSince last year Ukrainian planners have worked with NATO and war-gamed options for their offensives in 2023. Training institutions in Ukraine and beyond have worked until the last moment to prepare soldiers. Ukrainian formations have trained together to rehearse obstacle-breaching, the penetration of enemy defences and the exploitation of Russian withdrawals.\nFor months a reconnaissance battle has been taking place along the frontline. Ukrainian and Russian forces have fought for information on the ground, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), electronic warfare and satellite imagery, while also seeking to deny information to their adversary. Both have been stockpiling logistical items, from food and fuel to ammunition. Ukraine\u2019s armed forces have taken on masses of new equipment and issued it to units.\nUkraine stepped up its long-range strikes on Russian targets in recent weeks. The first kind of target was operational. These strikes hit Russian headquarters, supply locations and troop concentrations, and aimed to break down the cohesion of Russian defences and the ability to respond to Ukrainian thrusts. The second kind of strike was political. These included a drone attack on Moscow and incursions into Belgorod, a Russian region on the border with Ukraine. The aim was to cause unease among leaders in Moscow and make them reconsider where to deploy Russian forces.\nThe new Ukrainian advances around Bakhmut and in southern Ukraine appear to confirm that H-Hour\u2014the time a military operation commences\u2014has arrived. The wily Ukrainians, having conducted offensives in Kharkiv and Kherson, learned from the planning and execution of these operations. As their training and planning have improved, so has their ability to deceive the enemy and to synchronise complex arms operations on multiple axes.\nThe Ukrainians will open up other axes of advance as they attempt to mislead the Russians about the true main effort of their campaign. As they conduct attacks, they will also be observing the Russian counter-actions: how the Russians respond to these attacks, shift reserves and reinforce key areas will provide further opportunities for the Ukrainians to exploit. Ukraine\u2019s military leaders have a knack for sniffing out Russian weakness and deceiving the enemy about their intentions; they did this superbly before the offensive that liberated most of the north-eastern Kharkiv province last September. No one understands the Russian military mind better than they do.\nAs the different phases of the campaign unfold, it will be the drive, professionalism and inspiration of Ukraine\u2019s military leaders\u2014who are a mix of professional soldiers and mobilised citizens\u2014that will determine its success or failure. The campaign will be complex, bloody and almost always confusing to outside observers. It will be a massive undertaking that unfolds over months, not days. There will be times when it will be difficult to see an end\u2014or a purpose\u2014to the destruction. And there will be many surprises, such as the collapse this week of the Kakhovka dam, which will have impacts large and small, good and bad, on the Ukrainian campaign.\nBut just as the Ukrainians have held their nerve, prepared well and patiently waited to strike a massive blow, so too must the citizens and politicians of the West watch and be prepared to provide more assistance where needed. In June 1944, as the massive Allied invasion force crossed the English Channel, General Dwight Eisenhower wrote that \u201cthe eyes of the world are upon you.\u201d The Ukrainians, having fought, suffered and sacrificed over the past 16 months, know full well that the world is watching as they start the next phase of the attempt to liberate their nation.\u25a0\nMick Ryan served for more than 30 years in various roles in Australia\u2019s army and the US Joint Staff.
