Others suspect it is spying; unlike a similar European observatory, China\u2019s is closed to outsiders and staffed by military folk. In September the governor of Tierra del Fuego, on the tip of Argentina, offered his province as \u201cthe gateway\u201d for China to Antarctica, with a logistics base for ships. \nThe Fern\u00e1ndez administration may have underestimated how hostile the United States has recently become towards China, and how determined it is to prevent China from gaining a foothold in its hemisphere. Anything that looks like Chinese military activity in the region is sure to infuriate any American administration. Although Argentina is not like the dictatorships in Cuba or Venezuela, which the United States regards as foes, some hotheads in Washington suggest it is heading that way. On February 28th Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar, an American legislator, claimed that Argentina had struck a deal with China to build Chinese warplanes in Argentina. She called it \u201ca pact with the devil that could have consequences of biblical proportions\u201d. The Argentine government said there was no such plan. \nAlthough the Peronists are suspicious of the government in Washington, they do not want to alienate it, not least because support from the IMF depends on American goodwill. They have begun to walk back from the deals with China to which the United States most objects. Argentina now says it will build the maritime base in Tierra del Fuego with its own money, which means it is unlikely to happen. An Argentine plan to buy Chinese fighter jets was cancelled in December; Argentina may now buy vintage American jets instead, if it can find the money. \nFrustrated with Argentina\u2019s central government, some Chinese investors are dealing directly with provincial governments. Governor Morales in Jujuy has made multiple trips to China. Jujuy\u2019s arid soil is little use for farming, but it has sunshine and minerals. A solar park at Cauchari, built high on an altiplano (plateau) with Chinese money and technology, yields enough electricity for 160,000 homes. A nearby $852m Sino-Argentine lithium project is expected to start producing the metal, used in electric-car batteries, this year. Mr Morales says Argentina has \u201cgreat opportunities\u2026in a world hungry for food and energy\u201d. It would receive \u201cfar greater investment flows\u201d if it scrapped capital controls and had only one exchange rate. \n A ray of hope in Jujuy\n\nThe election in October is expected to bring in a government with saner economic policies, which ought to help Argentina\u2019s commercial relations with China. It may also be less willing than the Peronists are to promote China\u2019s ambitions in the western hemisphere. \u201cWe are democratic and believe in human rights. We don\u2019t [share the Chinese] vision of the world,\u201d says a senior member of the opposition. But economically, \u201cthey need what we have, and we should take advantage of that, [by exporting] minerals and food.\u201d Mr Giusto agrees. Uruguay, Argentina\u2019s better-governed neighbour, maintains excellent relations with the United States and good ones with China, he notes. It exports beef and behaves predictably. \nChina\u2019s communist regime may grumble if Argentina elects a government that is less friendly to its strategic aims and closer to the United States. But if that makes Argentina\u2019s economic policy less wacky, Chinese investors may quietly welcome it. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "How not to deal with China", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "The Americas"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/u9avqma9ca3p14gs9dp3hjvt3ebg1mr5", "tegID": "u9avqma9ca3p14gs9dp3hjvt3ebg1mr5", "headline": "The Americas", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/10/brazils-foreign-policy-is-hyperactive-ambitious-and-naive", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/tqfsuih1vhvl930gdrp2bbnhk7rhvokv", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Brazil\u2019s foreign policy is hyperactive, ambitious and naive", "subheadline": "Back in the big league", "datePublished": "2023-04-10T15:27:48Z", "description": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva goes to Beijing with grand plans of a \u201cpeace club\u201d over Ukraine", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230415_AMP001.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/05/evangelicals-may-soon-rival-catholics-in-latin-america", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/4ad5m3gqqa56irhg88uf6ml7s18csdoj", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Evangelicals may soon rival Catholics in Latin America", "subheadline": "Prophets of the ballot box", "datePublished": "2023-04-05T14:42:55Z", "description": "A fifth of the region are evangelical.

In fact, it also produces power in Pakistan. Sorry.\nTHEY SHOULD be a perfect match, like a steak and a glass of Malbec. Argentina has fertile land and skilled farmers. China has 1.4bn mouths to feed. Bilateral trade should be sizzling. But Argentine policy is so erratic that China is often left asking: where\u2019s the beef? \nSometimes, literally. In 2018 China opened its market to Argentine beef. At first, trade boomed. However, in 2021 Argentina slapped a beef-export ban on itself. \u201cThe Chinese couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d recalls Patricio Giusto of the China-Argentina Observatory, a think-tank.\nThe convoluted logic went like this. Domestic meat prices were rising, upsetting barbecue-loving Argentines. President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez reasoned that if he stopped foreigners from wolfing Argentine beef, there would be more for domestic consumers. The ban did little to curb inflation, which is now nearly 100% year on year and mostly caused by the government\u2019s frenzied money-printing. But the export ban gored Argentine farmers and infuriated their Chinese customers.\nCleverer engagement would yield huge benefits. Argentina desperately needs capital; China has deep pockets. China craves minerals; Argentina has mountains of them. Rather than exploit those economic opportunities, Argentina\u2019s current government of prickly left-leaning Peronists has given priority to political and diplomatic ties with China, which alarms the United States. A more pragmatic one would seek to get along well with both big powers, while taking full advantage of the way the Argentine and Chinese economies complement each other. Argentina\u2019s next national election, due in October, may bring such a government to power. \n\nIn recent decades the economic relationship between Argentina and China has burgeoned. Bilateral trade has increased from $2.3bn in 2001 to $26bn last year. Several big Chinese investment projects have been announced. More than half of the 62 loans doled out by Chinese commercial banks in Latin America between 2007 and 2021 have gone to Argentina, according to the Inter-American Dialogue, a think-tank in Washington (see chart). Most of this has taken place since 2015. A branch of ICBC, China\u2019s biggest commercial bank, dominates the skyline near the presidential palace in Buenos Aires. \nLately, though, progress has stalled. Wherever Argentina has a comparative advantage, the Fern\u00e1ndez government erodes it. The total ban on beef exports has gone, but bans remain on seven popular cuts of beef, such as short ribs. Crops are whacked with export taxes ranging from 7% (for sunflower oil) to a crushing 33% for soya. This discourages investment and costs Argentina a fortune. If it had halfway sensible policies it could add $25bn a year to grain and oilseed exports within a decade, estimates David Miazzo of Fada, a think-tank. That is equivalent to 5% of today\u2019s GDP. But the government is desperate for short-term cash, and shiploads of grain are hard to hide and easy to tax. \nChinese investments that generate headlines often run into trouble. A year ago China announced an $8bn deal to build a nuclear power plant near Buenos Aires. It was eager to show off its Hualong One nuclear technology, which so far only produces power in China itself and Pakistan. It also hoped to lock Argentina into the kind of long-term relationship that nuclear projects require. \nThe problem is that Argentina cannot afford the price tag (which with interest could add up to $13bn, estimates Julian Gadano, a former energy official). Its net foreign reserves are a mere $2.5bn, according to Econviews, a consultancy. Argentina owes more than any other country to the IMF, and is trying to secure another lifeline. Having renegotiated the nuclear project several times, Argentina is begging Chinese lenders to cover 100% of the cost, up from 85%. The project \u201cis not going to happen\u201d, predicts Mr Gadano. \nIn 2014, during the presidency of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner (who is now the country\u2019s vice-president), Argentina borrowed $4.7bn from three Chinese state-owned banks to build two hydroelectric dams in Santa Cruz, Ms Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s political stronghold. Interest payments are now a big drain on the budget, and the dams have yet to produce any electricity. Last year Chinese firms seemed well placed to win a contract to build a pipeline to Buenos Aires for gas from Vaca Muerta, one of the world\u2019s largest deposits of shale gas and oil. But after some wrangling, they abandoned the bidding. In 2020 Sinopec, a Chinese oil giant, pulled out of Argentina after squabbles with labour unions. \nThe incentive to invest in energy is dulled by price controls. Households pay hardly anything for electricity and waste it copiously. Power cuts are common. \nRegardless of their line of business, \u201cChinese firms have the same problems as all companies that want to invest in Argentina,\u201d says Gerardo Morales, the governor of Jujuy province. In addition to high inflation investors must contend with currency controls, which make it hard to repatriate profits. A system of multiple exchange rates (there are at least a dozen for the dollar) causes confusion and distortion. Exporters must surrender their dollars at the official rate, which is roughly half what they are worth. The government allocates cut-price hard currency in a process riddled with graft. Special rates apply to such things as rock concerts (the \u201cColdplay\u201d rate) and streaming services (the \u201cNetflix\u201d rate). Chinese firms find it hard to operate in a country where policy changes direction as often and unpredictably as a football at Lionel Messi\u2019s feet. \nArgentina seems more interested in being China\u2019s ally than its supplier. Vice-President Fern\u00e1ndez (no relation to her nominal boss) recently gushed that China was the \u201cmost successful capitalist system\u201d. China plays up similarities between Taiwan and the Falkland islands, a British territory that Argentina claims. (One parallel it does not mention is that the Falkland islanders, like the Taiwanese, have no desire to be ruled by their bigger neighbour.)\nMany of Argentina\u2019s recent ventures with China are long on political symbolism and short on economic substance. Some of these have irked the United States. Last year Mr Fern\u00e1ndez announced that Argentina would join the Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese global infrastructure scheme. The agreement included no new financial commitments. China has built a space observatory in Patagonia, which it claims is purely for scientific purposes\u2014the far-southern latitude gives it a view of the cosmos unavailable from China. Others suspect it is spying; unlike a similar European observatory, China\u2019s is closed to outsiders and staffed by military folk. In September the governor of Tierra del Fuego, on the tip of Argentina, offered his province as \u201cthe gateway\u201d for China to Antarctica, with a logistics base for ships. \nThe Fern\u00e1ndez administration may have underestimated how hostile the United States has recently become towards China, and how determined it is to prevent China from gaining a foothold in its hemisphere. Anything that looks like Chinese military activity in the region is sure to infuriate any American administration. Although Argentina is not like the dictatorships in Cuba or Venezuela, which the United States regards as foes, some hotheads in Washington suggest it is heading that way. On February 28th Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar, an American legislator, claimed that Argentina had struck a deal with China to build Chinese warplanes in Argentina. She called it \u201ca pact with the devil that could have consequences of biblical proportions\u201d. The Argentine government said there was no such plan. \nAlthough the Peronists are suspicious of the government in Washington, they do not want to alienate it, not least because support from the IMF depends on American goodwill. They have begun to walk back from the deals with China to which the United States most objects. Argentina now says it will build the maritime base in Tierra del Fuego with its own money, which means it is unlikely to happen. An Argentine plan to buy Chinese fighter jets was cancelled in December; Argentina may now buy vintage American jets instead, if it can find the money. \nFrustrated with Argentina\u2019s central government, some Chinese investors are dealing directly with provincial governments. Governor Morales in Jujuy has made multiple trips to China. Jujuy\u2019s arid soil is little use for farming, but it has sunshine and minerals. A solar park at Cauchari, built high on an altiplano (plateau) with Chinese money and technology, yields enough electricity for 160,000 homes. A nearby $852m Sino-Argentine lithium project is expected to start producing the metal, used in electric-car batteries, this year. Mr Morales says Argentina has \u201cgreat opportunities\u2026in a world hungry for food and energy\u201d. It would receive \u201cfar greater investment flows\u201d if it scrapped capital controls and had only one exchange rate. \n A ray of hope in Jujuy\n\nThe election in October is expected to bring in a government with saner economic policies, which ought to help Argentina\u2019s commercial relations with China. It may also be less willing than the Peronists are to promote China\u2019s ambitions in the western hemisphere. \u201cWe are democratic and believe in human rights. We don\u2019t [share the Chinese] vision of the world,\u201d says a senior member of the opposition. But economically, \u201cthey need what we have, and we should take advantage of that, [by exporting] minerals and food.\u201d Mr Giusto agrees. Uruguay, Argentina\u2019s better-governed neighbour, maintains excellent relations with the United States and good ones with China, he notes. It exports beef and behaves predictably. \nChina\u2019s communist regime may grumble if Argentina elects a government that is less friendly to its strategic aims and closer to the United States. But if that makes Argentina\u2019s economic policy less wacky, Chinese investors may quietly welcome it. \u25a0", "description": "China is asking its South American partner: where\u2019s the beef?", "ogDescription": "China is asking its South American partner: where\u2019s the beef?", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230311_AMP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-03-07T19:43:05Z", "dateModified": "2023-03-31T14:54:55Z", "dateCreated": "2023-03-07T19:42:47Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-03-11T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "Buenos Aires", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/pmn5c23am1dm0b26bgf3uhkvklfsfan0", "publication": [{"id": "/content/4bjbb5o9qm51v4efaobqs70vo3o667r2", "context": {"position": 600.3, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ve320d71dr1cruj8ieb56blr3kctd812", "context": {"position": 600.3, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/bipu216gmh04f7m6257iqcjhvjhammgj", "context": {"position": 600.3, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/kkqn9gi2rebculng66ik8id1cm2hjfpu", "context": {"position": 600.3, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/n9bj364p8fh0ub92dum521n5i9jn313d", "context": {"position": 600.3, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/m2d5ii22kgk4ldh8tkfgatgjvjgjb9bv", "context": {"position": 600.3, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/h59dvt78sgj1hq0h9h9ur54a5kv5uhg1", "context": {"position": 600.3, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Argentina is wasting the vast opportunities China offers it", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/03/07/argentina-is-wasting-the-vast-opportunities-china-offers-it", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
