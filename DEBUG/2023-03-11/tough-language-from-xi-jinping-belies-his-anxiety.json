During the annual session of the country\u2019s parliament, which began on March 5th, Chinese officials have been airing their worries. President Xi Jinping pointed his finger at America, accusing it of leading Western countries in a campaign of \u201call-out containment, encirclement and suppression\u201d against China. The outgoing prime minister, Li Keqiang, said such threats were escalating. He set an unexpectedly cautious target for China\u2019s economic growth this year. Their message is clear: China\u2019s post-covid reopening to the world could be a bumpy one. \nMr Xi is China\u2019s worrier-in-chief. A handy 251-page book, published by the Communist Party in 2020, contains nothing but anxiety-related snippets from his speeches. They cover every topic from terrorism and \u201ccolour revolutions\u201d to the \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d\u2014that is, stalling growth. The extracts are peppered with metaphors: lurking tigers, boulders on the road, terrifying waves and stormy seas. One bit comes from remarks to domestic security chiefs in 2014, just over a year after Mr Xi became China\u2019s leader. It shows how long-standing his current worries are: \u201cWestern countries such as America increasingly feel fishbones in their throats and blade-tips in their backs, so are stepping up their strategy of Westernising and splitting our country.\u201d\nUsually Mr Xi avoids explicit criticism of America at public-facing occasions such as meetings of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), as the legislature is known. His break from custom this time, at a meeting on March 6th with advisers to the NPC, suggests anxiety levels are growing. He said American-led efforts at containing China had presented \u201cunprecedented severe challenges\u201d to the country\u2019s development. At an NPC-organised news conference, his new foreign minister, Qin Gang (known for his feisty language, no matter the context), was even more forthright: \u201cIf the United States does not hit the brake but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation.\u201d \nFor all such rhetoric, however, Chinese officials have avoided using the NPC, and the parallel meeting of its advisory body, to make any explicit threats against America. On Taiwan, the most contentious issue in the bilateral relationship, they have stuck to ambiguous language. In his farewell speech to the NPC, Mr Li said the armed forces should \u201cintensify military training and preparedness across the board\u201d. China\u2019s defence spending is higher than it admits. But a draft budget said it should grow by 7.2% this year. That would leave its share of GDP largely unchanged, once inflation is taken into account. And Mr Li said China should \u201cpromote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations\u201d. \nIt may be that, for all their disquiet, Chinese leaders do not want to escalate tensions with the West, nor narrow their room for manoeuvre. Mr Xi said officials should \u201cdare to struggle\u201d, but he also called for calm (using the word three times) in the face of \u201cprofound and complex changes in the international and domestic environments\u201d. By emphasising threats from the West, such as America\u2019s efforts to limit Chinese access to cutting-edge technologies, it is possible that China hopes to focus attention at home on the need for greater industrial self-reliance. On March 10th the nearly 3,000 delegates are due to vote on (ie, rubber-stamp) a plan for restructuring some government ministries. This is expected to give the party more control over vital areas of work, including technological development. A senior official said one reason for the shake-up was \u201cthe severe situation of\u2026external containment and suppression\u201d. \nSuch a response is typical of Mr Xi. His book of worries, titled \u201cExcerpts from Xi Jinping\u2019s Talks on Guarding Against Risks and Challenges and Responding to Emergencies\u201d (a snip at $7.50), is replete with recommendations that the party tighten its grip. But at the same time, Mr Xi and his officials have been using the NPC, which ends on March 13th, to send reassuring signals to entrepreneurs who have been spooked by the party\u2019s growing muscularity in the economic domain. To revive growth, which was 3% last year, the second-lowest rate since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, private firms will be crucial. They contribute three-fifths of GDP. \n\u201cIn the coming period,\u201d said Mr Xi, echoing the prime minister, \u201cthe risks and challenges we face will only increase and become more severe.\u201d He then heaped praise on the private economy, calling it an \u201cimportant force for long-term rule by our party\u201d and describing entrepreneurs as \u201cour own people\u201d. Businesspeople will be cautious, however. These are phrases he has used before. There may have been a sigh of relief among some company bosses that Mr Li did not mention the term \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d in his speech to the NPC. The slogan, favoured by Mr Xi, is associated in some people\u2019s minds with heavy-handed treatment by the party of billionaires and their firms. But in his meeting with the NPC\u2019s advisers, Mr Xi used the phrase four times. \nThe new guys\nMany businesspeople will wonder whether to take solace from several high-level appointments that will be unveiled at the NPC (aside from the inevitable reconfirmation of Mr Xi as president, which will be announced on March 10th). The most important will be the naming of a new prime minister on March 11th. It is almost certain to be Li Qiang, a former party chief of Shanghai and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr Xi. \nMr Li is an intriguing figure. He is disliked by many in Shanghai for overseeing a draconian two-month lockdown of the city last year to stop the spread of covid. Businesspeople tend to have a higher opinion of him. High-level politics in China is a black box. But Reuters, a news agency, said that Mr Li was behind the sudden ending of the \u201czero-covid\u201d policy in December. As the newly appointed head of a covid task-force, Mr Li \u201cresisted pressure from the president to slow the pace of reopening\u201d, Reuters reported.\nAlso closely watched will be people chosen to work under Mr Li on economic matters. Many of those slated for top posts have far less experience of the West than their predecessors. But Mr Xi may reckon that matters less now, with the West ganging up against him. \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of
