Their commanders followed in more choppers carrying ultralight vehicles and communications gear. Anything superfluous was left behind. No big screens for video links of the sort used in Iraq and Afghanistan: to avoid detection, the marines must make sure their communications blend into the background just as surely as their camouflage blends into the tropical greenery. The goal of the exercise: to disperse around an unnamed island, link up with friendly \u201cgreen\u201d allies and repel an amphibious invasion by \u201cred\u201d forces.\nIgnore the polite abstractions. The marines are training for a war with China, probably precipitated by an invasion of Taiwan. Their base in Okinawa, at the southern end of the Japanese archipelago, is just 600km (370 miles) from Taiwan. The two islands are part of what American military planners call the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d: a series of archipelagoes and islands, big and small, that stretches from Japan to Malaysia, impeding naval passage from China to the Pacific. Whether by harrying Chinese ships from a distance or\u2014much less likely\u2014by deploying to Taiwan to help repel a Chinese landing, the marines will be early participants in any conflict.\nThe hardest part, says Lieutenant-Colonel Jason Copeland, Darkside\u2019s commanding officer, would be dealing with \u201can adversary that\u2019s coming at you in mass\u201d. As China\u2019s military power grows, predicting how a war over Taiwan might unfold, and thus improving the odds of fending China off without unleashing a nuclear calamity, is getting ever harder. The only certainty is that, even if all nuclear weapons remained in their silos, such a conflict would have horrific consequences, not just for the 23m people of Taiwan, but for the world.\nChina\u2019s Communist leaders have claimed Taiwan since Nationalist forces fled to it after losing a civil war in 1949. America has long pledged to help the island defend itself. But in recent years, on both sides, rhetoric and preparations have grown more fevered. China\u2019s forces often practise island landings. Its warships and fighter jets routinely cross the \u201cmedian line\u201d (in effect Taiwan\u2019s maritime boundary) and harass military ships and planes of America and its allies. After Nancy Pelosi, at the time the Speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives, visited Taiwan last year, China fired missiles towards it.\n\nDire strait\nAmerica, meanwhile, is sending more military trainers to Taiwan. The Taiwanese government recently increased mandatory military service from four months to a year. Prominent congressmen have urged President Joe Biden to learn from Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine and give Taiwan all the weapons it may need before an invasion, not after one has started. Adding to the sense of impending crisis are America\u2019s efforts to throttle China\u2019s tech industry and Mr Xi\u2019s growing friendliness with Russia. \nAmerican military commanders and intelligence chiefs say Mr Xi has ordered the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to develop the capacity to invade Taiwan by 2027. Some think conflict is closer. \u201cMy gut tells me we will fight in 2025,\u201d General Michael Minihan, head of America\u2019s air mobility command, recently warned subordinates. Both sides fear that time is running out: America worries that China\u2019s armed forces may soon become too strong to deter, while China frets that the prospect of peaceful reunification is evaporating.\n\u201cWar with China is not inevitable, and it\u2019s not imminent,\u201d declares Admiral John Aquilino, commander of America\u2019s Indo-Pacific Command, who would oversee any fight with China. Speaking in his headquarters overlooking Pearl Harbour, scene of Japan\u2019s pre-emptive strike in 1941, he says his first mission is \u201cto do everything in my power to prevent a conflict\u201d. Nonetheless, he adds, \u201cif deterrence fails, you must be prepared to fight and win.\u201d As Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine shows, he warns, \u201cThere is no such thing as a short war.\u201d \nThe first question for America\u2019s strategists is how much warning they would get of an impending invasion. The PLA, with an estimated 2m active personnel, versus Taiwan\u2019s 163,000, would need extensive preparations to conduct what would be the biggest amphibious assault since the D-Day landings in 1944. It would have to cancel leave, gather landing ships, stockpile munitions, set up mobile command posts and much more. \nBut in a war of choice, with Mr Xi able to pick his timing, many of these moves could be disguised as military exercises. American defence officials say they might see unambiguous signs of imminent war, such as stockpiling of blood supplies, only a fortnight ahead. For smaller operations, to seize islands Taiwan controls close to the mainland, say, there might be only a few hours\u2019 warning\u2014if that. \nAmerica would want to expose China\u2019s preparations early, as it did with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and rally an international coalition in opposition. That would be easier if Mr Xi embarked on an outright invasion. But China may try to exploit the ambiguities of Taiwan\u2019s status: it does not have diplomatic relations with most other countries. If Mr Xi cites some \u201cprovocation\u201d, and begins with actions short of war, such as a blockade, America or its allies might equivocate. \nAmerica must also weigh how far its preparations risk precipitating conflict. Send aircraft-carriers to the region as a show of force? Deploy troops to Taiwan? Threaten China\u2019s oil supplies through the Strait of Malacca? All might be deemed provocations by China, if not acts of war.\nAs war approaches, Taiwan will move navy ships from its vulnerable western coast to the east, behind the mountain range that runs along the eastern side of the island. It would seek to hide jet fighters in underground shelters and mobilise its 2.3m reservists. It would also have to control widespread panic, as multitudes attempted to flee and as transport links to the outside world were cut. \nAmerica, too, would be dispersing jets from exposed bases. The marines would deploy around maritime choke-points. American submarines would slip under the waves, some mustering close to Taiwan. Some American and Taiwanese military commanders would no doubt press for military strikes against China\u2019s gathering invasion force. They would probably be overruled by those seeking a diplomatic solution, or at least not wanting to be blamed for firing the first shot. \nChina, for its part, would have to take a momentous decision. Should it limit its attack to Taiwan, hoping to create a fait accompli as America and its allies dither? Or should it strike America\u2019s forces in the region, in a new Pearl Harbour? The first option leaves America free to attack the invasion fleet; the latter all but guarantees its wholehearted entry into the war, and probably Japan\u2019s, too, if China attacked American bases there. \nAn invasion would almost certainly begin with massive missile and rocket strikes on Taiwan. These would quickly destroy much of Taiwan\u2019s navy, air force and air defences. Wang Hongguang, a former deputy commander of the PLA region opposite Taiwan, predicted in 2018 that there would be 24 hours of bombardment\u2014first on military and political targets, then on civilian infrastructure such as power plants and fuel depots. He suggested that China would blind Taiwan\u2019s satellites, cut its subsea internet cables and use electronic warfare to scramble its command-and-control systems, hobbling co-ordination with American and allied forces. \nGeneral Wang said the onslaught would cause enough havoc to open at least a two-day window for invasion. If American forces did not arrive within three days, he blustered, \u201cdon\u2019t bother to make a trip in vain\u201d. China will also do its best to sap Taiwan\u2019s will to fight. Its cyber-forces will try to hack local television and radio, and bombard Taiwanese soldiers with text and social-media messages, offering rewards to mutineers and deserters. \nChina must then confront the formidable challenge of an amphibious assault, one of the most difficult forms of warfare. The beaches of Kinmen, a Taiwanese island just 3km from the mainland, are dotted with relics from an attempted invasion in 1949, when Nationalist forces killed or captured almost the entire advance party of 9,000 Communist troops who landed in small fishing boats. The PLA has come far since then, acquiring advanced weaponry and studying precedents such as D-Day, the American-led landings at Incheon in Korea in 1950 and Britain\u2019s recapture of the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982. \nWalk of strife\nYet the risks are still great. China has not fought a war since invading Vietnam in 1979. Although the Taiwan Strait is only 130km wide at its narrowest, its currents and tides are powerful and erratic. Conditions are usually propitious only in March-May and September-October. Just 14 of Taiwan\u2019s beaches are suitable for landings and they are heavily fortified, especially the ones close to Taipei, where Chinese forces would probably prefer to start an invasion (see map 1). Taiwan has built lots of bunkers and tunnels in the area.\n\nNor is it certain that the PLA has enough ships to transport an adequate landing force quickly across the strait. It would need 300,000 to 1m troops to be sure of subduing Taiwan. It has six amphibious army brigades stationed nearby, with a combined 20,000 troops, plus a similar number of marines. But China\u2019s amphibious landing ships could probably ferry only about 20,000 soldiers across in the first day or two, depending on how much equipment they take. Likewise, the PLA\u2019s transport aircraft could probably convey only half of its 20,000 airborne troops in the opening phase. The PLA recently practised using ferries and other civilian ships, which could bring across many more units but, for that to work well, China would need to capture a still-usable port. \nThe war in Ukraine has raised fresh doubts, too, especially about China\u2019s ground forces. Its combined-arms battalions, including its amphibious ones, are modelled on Russia\u2019s battalion tactical groups, which have struggled in Ukraine. Even if China succeeded in swiftly decapitating Taiwan\u2019s leadership, it might still face protracted fighting against forces replicating the Ukrainians\u2019 use of portable missile-launchers and drones.\nTaiwan\u2019s strategy, meanwhile, is to thwart China\u2019s initial landing or prevent it from bringing enough troops. Taiwanese forces would block ports and beaches with sea mines, submerged ships and other obstacles. Backed by surviving aircraft and naval vessels, they would strike China\u2019s approaching force with missiles and pound disembarking Chinese troops with artillery and rockets. Some PLA texts suggest that Taiwan has underwater pipelines off its beaches that could release flammable liquid. Some of its outlying islands are protected by remote-controlled guns. \nIf the PLA broke out of its beachheads, it would face a slog through arduous terrain to reach Taipei and other urban centres. Then both sides would face a challenge for which neither is fully prepared: urban warfare. Taiwan is reluctant to fight in its cities, fearing high civilian casualties. The PLA does train for urban warfare, but had long banked on a quick victory if it reached Taipei. Since the war in Ukraine began, however, both sides have been practising fighting in built-up areas more. \n No easy way past\n\nEven if a Chinese invasion got bogged down, though, time would not be on Taiwan\u2019s side. \u201cWe can fend them off for one or two weeks but no longer,\u201d says Si-fu Ou of Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defence and Security Research, a think-tank. Unless Taiwanese forces resist steadfastly, everything else is futile. But, by the same token, Taiwan cannot hope to defend itself in the long run without American help. \nAs an island, Taiwan is not just harder to invade than Ukraine, but also harder to support. Its ports might be destroyed by China, its own forces or even America\u2019s. Attempting to bring reinforcements or supplies to the island as Chinese missiles rain down would be almost as difficult as attempting to invade.\nAt the very least, America and Taiwan would need help from allies. Japan, which hosts tens of thousands of American troops, has capable forces. The Philippines is weak militarily but close to Taiwan. Australia is closely allied but modestly armed and farther away. Countries in the Pacific could provide rear bases. More distant allies, such as Britain, might send naval vessels. A big uncertainty is how much India would help. A lot would depend on how the crisis unfolds and who is blamed for it.\n\nAmerica\u2019s plans to help Taiwan used to hinge on aircraft-carriers. It sent one to the area after China fired missiles near Taiwan in 1995 and again after another salvo in 1996. But China has since invested heavily in \u201canti-access/area-denial\u201d (A2/AD) weapons, designed to fend off American ships and aircraft. They include the DF-26 missile, which can strike deep into the Pacific (see map 2), and new hypersonic missiles that are harder to intercept. China\u2019s navy is now the world\u2019s largest, with a fleet of submarines to attack approaching American ships. Its long-range bombers are also a menace. David Ochmanek of the RAND Corporation, a think-tank that has run classified war-games simulating a Taiwan conflict, argues that old American strategies now \u201clead to defeat\u201d. \nAmerican planners\u2019 alternative is summed up with three D\u2019s: disrupt Chinese operations within the first island chain, defend allies on it and dominate the sea and air beyond. America must overcome daunting problems: the \u201ctyranny of distance\u201d in the vast Pacific Ocean, the growth of China\u2019s \u201cweapons engagement zone\u201d to encompass American bases in the western Pacific and the sheer mass of China\u2019s manpower and weapons, which exceeds America\u2019s in many categories.\n\nThe risk of Chinese attack, by missiles or bombers, decreases with distance (see chart). But even Guam, America\u2019s big military hub some 3,000km from China, is vulnerable. What is more, America\u2019s air defence is worryingly thin. It also has few means of passive defence, such as concrete aircraft hangars.\nAmerican officers speak of the prospect of war with a mixture of dread at China\u2019s growing power (\u201cEvery day I am astounded by their capabilities,\u201d says one), and optimism that new tactics can achieve victory. They emphasise \u201cdistributed lethality\u201d, meaning the scattering and constant movement of forces to avoid becoming easy targets, while maintaining the capacity to gather or co-ordinate in attacks. This will rely to an unprecedented degree on America\u2019s experience of fighting as a \u201cjoint force\u201d, in which separate military branches and weapons systems reinforce each other.\nMilitary jets would disperse from big bases, gather in the air for battle and settle where they can on specks of land. They would repeat the pattern as quickly as possible by \u201chot-pit\u201d refuelling with engines running. Sometimes planes would perch in civilian airports; sometimes on austere airfields, many dating from the second world war, which are being refurbished. Adding ever more concrete to protect aircraft \u201cis a fool\u2019s errand\u201d, says Brigadier-General Paul Birch, commander of the 36th Wing at Andersen air base, in Guam. \u201cBeing in the air is much safer.\u201d\nEngineers, meanwhile, would aim to repair cratered runways within about six hours. Ground crews would set up pop-up hangars as well as traffic-control centres and data links. A big headache would be how to get fuel and munitions to the right places. One aim of this \u201cagile combat employment\u201d is to force China to expend its large but finite stock of missiles. \nRather than fight near Taiwan, American surface ships would probably hold back, to survive, provide air defence for Guam and other rear bases and blockade Chinese trade. They would \u201cpulse\u201d\u2014sailing briefly in and out of the danger zone\u2014to shoot at Chinese ships and planes.\nBrothers with arms\nMarines would deploy to \u201ckey maritime terrain\u201d, especially islands dominating the straits that separate Taiwan from Japan and the Philippines. They would reinforce the local troops, reconnoitre Chinese dispositions and, armed with new missiles coming into service in the next few months, fire on enemy ships. The marines are creating three new \u201cmarine littoral regiments\u201d, each with more than 2,000 troops, giving up their tanks and many of their howitzers.\nRead more of this package\nHow to avoid war over Taiwan\nSpecial report: Frontline Formosa\n\nSome critics say these units would be too vulnerable; others reckon that, without deployment to Taiwan itself, they would be too distant to help much in the main battle. The marines, though, argue that they would multiply the threats China must face, \u201ccanalise\u201d Chinese ships into vulnerable positions and, above all, \u201csense and make sense\u201d of Chinese deployments. General David Berger, the marines\u2019 commandant, talks of \u201cturning the tables\u201d on China by using an A2/AD strategy to defend the first island chain. America won\u2019t have to fight its way in, he says: \u201cWe are there persistently, 52 weeks a year.\u201d\nDispersed warfare sacrifices efficiency for resilience. To succeed, though, lots of things need to go well. First, command-and-control networks must be able to withstand Chinese electronic attack. Planners talk of a yet-to-be-perfected \u201ckill web\u201d, in which artificial intelligence helps \u201csensors\u201d and \u201dshooters\u201d\u2014including those of allies\u2014operate together even when far apart. Marines on islands, stealthy F-35 fighters, drones and more can all act as nodes. Second, America would need more sophisticated logistics to supply far-flung units. Last, it must persuade allies to risk China\u2019s wrath. Their willingness would become clear only as hostilities erupt, which complicates planning.\nEarly in the war the job of sinking China\u2019s invasion fleet\u2014the critical task in defending Taiwan\u2014would fall mainly to submarines and long-range bombers. Though its boats are outnumbered by China\u2019s, America retains the edge in underwater warfare. Its attack submarines carry torpedoes, cruise missiles and sea mines. Sooner or later, however, they would run out of munitions, and would have to sail away for several days to replenish in places such as Guam, where they would be vulnerable.\nToo far away\nBombers flying from Hawaii, Alaska and the American mainland, meanwhile, would be using munitions that can be fired from beyond the reach of Chinese anti-aircraft missiles. But America\u2019s Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles, which can travel 200 nautical miles or more, would probably run out within a week. Thereafter, American forces would have to move closer to Taiwan to sink ships. America\u2019s hope is that, by then, China has also run short of long-range munitions. \nAmerica and China would debate whether and when to attack each others\u2019 satellites, potentially turning low-earth orbit into a scrapyard. Some war-games suggest they might refrain from doing so for fear of harming themselves. But as a senior American military official puts it, \u201cThe side that shoots first gets a big advantage.\u201d\nEvery stage of the war would be fought in the shadow of nuclear weapons. Mr Biden has talked about reducing America\u2019s reliance on nukes, and China espouses \u201cno first use\u201d. But the risk of disaster is presumably rising as China expands its arsenal. It will grow from 400 or so warheads today, the Pentagon reckons, to 1,000-odd by 2030 (still less than America and Russia have). A recent war game conducted by the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank, suggested that both sides underestimate the risk of escalation. This grows if either attacks the other\u2019s mainland, or if the conflict becomes protracted. \nThe toll of even a purely conventional war would be devastating, for the victors as well as the losers. A war game by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, another American think-tank, found that under its \u201cbase scenario\u201d Taiwanese, American and Japanese forces typically severed PLA supply lines after about ten days, stranding some 30,000 Chinese troops on the island. Taiwan survived as an autonomous entity, but was left with no electricity or basic services. America and Japan suffered, too, losing 382 aircraft and 43 ships, including two American aircraft-carriers. China lost 155 planes and 138 ships.\nThe economic cost would be enormous, too. RAND estimated in 2016 that a year-long war over Taiwan would reduce China\u2019s GDP by 25-35% and America\u2019s by 5-10%. The Rhodium Group, a consultancy, concluded in 2022 that the disruption to the supply of semiconductors (Taiwan makes 90% of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips) would cause global shortages of electronic goods, leading to \u201cincalculable\u201d damage to the world economy.\nGiven the appalling consequences, would America and China really go to war? Chinese officials say their preferred option is still peaceful unification, and deny there is any timetable for an attack. China also has many options short of an all-out invasion. They include economic coercion, a full or partial blockade and the seizure of outlying islands such as Kinmen. China may well embark on this sort of \u201cgrey-zone\u201d operation as a substitute for, or a prelude to, a wider attack. \nMr Xi has strong incentives to bide his time, not least because his forces are growing, whereas American defence spending is near an 80-year low as a share of GDP. But he may also feel pressure to attack if Taiwan abandons all pretence that it might ever reconcile with the mainland, and formally declares independence, or if America deploys troops to Taiwan. The year-long conflict in Ukraine is proof that an irredentist autocrat can miscalculate appallingly. Zhou Bo, a former senior officer in the PLA, notes that to achieve its aims, China does not need to exceed America\u2019s global might; it just needs an edge in the western Pacific. \nMany strategists in America and Asia fear that the loss of Taiwan would replace the American-led order in the region with a Chinese-led one. Japan and South Korea might feel obliged to develop their own nuclear weapons. Rather than constraining China, the first island chain would become a platform for it to project power farther afield. \u201cTaiwan is the cork in the bottle,\u201d as an American military official puts it.\nAmerica draws solace from Russia\u2019s failures in Ukraine, believing they have increased Mr Xi\u2019s doubts about his ability to take Taiwan. But to preserve the precarious balance across the Taiwan Strait, America must act with exquisite skill. It needs to reinforce Mr Xi\u2019s hesitation by strengthening itself, its allies and Taiwan, but not go so far that he thinks he must attack fast or give up on seizing Taiwan for ever. \u25a0\nCorrection (March 11th 2023): The original version of the chart in this article had the wrong scale on the y-axis.

Their commanders followed in more choppers carrying ultralight vehicles and communications gear. Anything superfluous was left behind. No big screens for video links of the sort used in Iraq and Afghanistan: to avoid detection, the marines must make sure their communications blend into the background just as surely as their camouflage blends into the tropical greenery. The goal of the exercise: to disperse around an unnamed island, link up with friendly \u201cgreen\u201d allies and repel an amphibious invasion by \u201cred\u201d forces.\nIgnore the polite abstractions. The marines are training for a war with China, probably precipitated by an invasion of Taiwan. Their base in Okinawa, at the southern end of the Japanese archipelago, is just 600km (370 miles) from Taiwan. The two islands are part of what American military planners call the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d: a series of archipelagoes and islands, big and small, that stretches from Japan to Malaysia, impeding naval passage from China to the Pacific. Whether by harrying Chinese ships from a distance or\u2014much less likely\u2014by deploying to Taiwan to help repel a Chinese landing, the marines will be early participants in any conflict.\nThe hardest part, says Lieutenant-Colonel Jason Copeland, Darkside\u2019s commanding officer, would be dealing with \u201can adversary that\u2019s coming at you in mass\u201d. As China\u2019s military power grows, predicting how a war over Taiwan might unfold, and thus improving the odds of fending China off without unleashing a nuclear calamity, is getting ever harder. The only certainty is that, even if all nuclear weapons remained in their silos, such a conflict would have horrific consequences, not just for the 23m people of Taiwan, but for the world.\nChina\u2019s Communist leaders have claimed Taiwan since Nationalist forces fled to it after losing a civil war in 1949. America has long pledged to help the island defend itself. But in recent years, on both sides, rhetoric and preparations have grown more fevered. China\u2019s forces often practise island landings. Its warships and fighter jets routinely cross the \u201cmedian line\u201d (in effect Taiwan\u2019s maritime boundary) and harass military ships and planes of America and its allies. After Nancy Pelosi, at the time the Speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives, visited Taiwan last year, China fired missiles towards it.\n\nDire strait\nAmerica, meanwhile, is sending more military trainers to Taiwan. The Taiwanese government recently increased mandatory military service from four months to a year. Prominent congressmen have urged President Joe Biden to learn from Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine and give Taiwan all the weapons it may need before an invasion, not after one has started. Adding to the sense of impending crisis are America\u2019s efforts to throttle China\u2019s tech industry and Mr Xi\u2019s growing friendliness with Russia. \nAmerican military commanders and intelligence chiefs say Mr Xi has ordered the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to develop the capacity to invade Taiwan by 2027. Some think conflict is closer. \u201cMy gut tells me we will fight in 2025,\u201d General Michael Minihan, head of America\u2019s air mobility command, recently warned subordinates. Both sides fear that time is running out: America worries that China\u2019s armed forces may soon become too strong to deter, while China frets that the prospect of peaceful reunification is evaporating.\n\u201cWar with China is not inevitable, and it\u2019s not imminent,\u201d declares Admiral John Aquilino, commander of America\u2019s Indo-Pacific Command, who would oversee any fight with China. Speaking in his headquarters overlooking Pearl Harbour, scene of Japan\u2019s pre-emptive strike in 1941, he says his first mission is \u201cto do everything in my power to prevent a conflict\u201d. Nonetheless, he adds, \u201cif deterrence fails, you must be prepared to fight and win.\u201d As Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine shows, he warns, \u201cThere is no such thing as a short war.\u201d \nThe first question for America\u2019s strategists is how much warning they would get of an impending invasion. The PLA, with an estimated 2m active personnel, versus Taiwan\u2019s 163,000, would need extensive preparations to conduct what would be the biggest amphibious assault since the D-Day landings in 1944. It would have to cancel leave, gather landing ships, stockpile munitions, set up mobile command posts and much more. \nBut in a war of choice, with Mr Xi able to pick his timing, many of these moves could be disguised as military exercises. American defence officials say they might see unambiguous signs of imminent war, such as stockpiling of blood supplies, only a fortnight ahead. For smaller operations, to seize islands Taiwan controls close to the mainland, say, there might be only a few hours\u2019 warning\u2014if that. \nAmerica would want to expose China\u2019s preparations early, as it did with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and rally an international coalition in opposition. That would be easier if Mr Xi embarked on an outright invasion. But China may try to exploit the ambiguities of Taiwan\u2019s status: it does not have diplomatic relations with most other countries. If Mr Xi cites some \u201cprovocation\u201d, and begins with actions short of war, such as a blockade, America or its allies might equivocate. \nAmerica must also weigh how far its preparations risk precipitating conflict. Send aircraft-carriers to the region as a show of force? Deploy troops to Taiwan? Threaten China\u2019s oil supplies through the Strait of Malacca? All might be deemed provocations by China, if not acts of war.\nAs war approaches, Taiwan will move navy ships from its vulnerable western coast to the east, behind the mountain range that runs along the eastern side of the island. It would seek to hide jet fighters in underground shelters and mobilise its 2.3m reservists. It would also have to control widespread panic, as multitudes attempted to flee and as transport links to the outside world were cut. \nAmerica, too, would be dispersing jets from exposed bases. The marines would deploy around maritime choke-points. American submarines would slip under the waves, some mustering close to Taiwan. Some American and Taiwanese military commanders would no doubt press for military strikes against China\u2019s gathering invasion force. They would probably be overruled by those seeking a diplomatic solution, or at least not wanting to be blamed for firing the first shot. \nChina, for its part, would have to take a momentous decision. Should it limit its attack to Taiwan, hoping to create a fait accompli as America and its allies dither? Or should it strike America\u2019s forces in the region, in a new Pearl Harbour? The first option leaves America free to attack the invasion fleet; the latter all but guarantees its wholehearted entry into the war, and probably Japan\u2019s, too, if China attacked American bases there. \nAn invasion would almost certainly begin with massive missile and rocket strikes on Taiwan. These would quickly destroy much of Taiwan\u2019s navy, air force and air defences. Wang Hongguang, a former deputy commander of the PLA region opposite Taiwan, predicted in 2018 that there would be 24 hours of bombardment\u2014first on military and political targets, then on civilian infrastructure such as power plants and fuel depots. He suggested that China would blind Taiwan\u2019s satellites, cut its subsea internet cables and use electronic warfare to scramble its command-and-control systems, hobbling co-ordination with American and allied forces. \nGeneral Wang said the onslaught would cause enough havoc to open at least a two-day window for invasion. If American forces did not arrive within three days, he blustered, \u201cdon\u2019t bother to make a trip in vain\u201d. China will also do its best to sap Taiwan\u2019s will to fight. Its cyber-forces will try to hack local television and radio, and bombard Taiwanese soldiers with text and social-media messages, offering rewards to mutineers and deserters. \nChina must then confront the formidable challenge of an amphibious assault, one of the most difficult forms of warfare. The beaches of Kinmen, a Taiwanese island just 3km from the mainland, are dotted with relics from an attempted invasion in 1949, when Nationalist forces killed or captured almost the entire advance party of 9,000 Communist troops who landed in small fishing boats. The PLA has come far since then, acquiring advanced weaponry and studying precedents such as D-Day, the American-led landings at Incheon in Korea in 1950 and Britain\u2019s recapture of the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982. \nWalk of strife\nYet the risks are still great. China has not fought a war since invading Vietnam in 1979. Although the Taiwan Strait is only 130km wide at its narrowest, its currents and tides are powerful and erratic. Conditions are usually propitious only in March-May and September-October. Just 14 of Taiwan\u2019s beaches are suitable for landings and they are heavily fortified, especially the ones close to Taipei, where Chinese forces would probably prefer to start an invasion (see map 1). Taiwan has built lots of bunkers and tunnels in the area.\n\nNor is it certain that the PLA has enough ships to transport an adequate landing force quickly across the strait. It would need 300,000 to 1m troops to be sure of subduing Taiwan. It has six amphibious army brigades stationed nearby, with a combined 20,000 troops, plus a similar number of marines. But China\u2019s amphibious landing ships could probably ferry only about 20,000 soldiers across in the first day or two, depending on how much equipment they take. Likewise, the PLA\u2019s transport aircraft could probably convey only half of its 20,000 airborne troops in the opening phase. The PLA recently practised using ferries and other civilian ships, which could bring across many more units but, for that to work well, China would need to capture a still-usable port. \nThe war in Ukraine has raised fresh doubts, too, especially about China\u2019s ground forces. Its combined-arms battalions, including its amphibious ones, are modelled on Russia\u2019s battalion tactical groups, which have struggled in Ukraine. Even if China succeeded in swiftly decapitating Taiwan\u2019s leadership, it might still face protracted fighting against forces replicating the Ukrainians\u2019 use of portable missile-launchers and drones.\nTaiwan\u2019s strategy, meanwhile, is to thwart China\u2019s initial landing or prevent it from bringing enough troops. Taiwanese forces would block ports and beaches with sea mines, submerged ships and other obstacles. Backed by surviving aircraft and naval vessels, they would strike China\u2019s approaching force with missiles and pound disembarking Chinese troops with artillery and rockets. Some PLA texts suggest that Taiwan has underwater pipelines off its beaches that could release flammable liquid. Some of its outlying islands are protected by remote-controlled guns. \nIf the PLA broke out of its beachheads, it would face a slog through arduous terrain to reach Taipei and other urban centres. Then both sides would face a challenge for which neither is fully prepared: urban warfare. Taiwan is reluctant to fight in its cities, fearing high civilian casualties. The PLA does train for urban warfare, but had long banked on a quick victory if it reached Taipei. Since the war in Ukraine began, however, both sides have been practising fighting in built-up areas more. \n No easy way past\n\nEven if a Chinese invasion got bogged down, though, time would not be on Taiwan\u2019s side. \u201cWe can fend them off for one or two weeks but no longer,\u201d says Si-fu Ou of Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defence and Security Research, a think-tank. Unless Taiwanese forces resist steadfastly, everything else is futile. But, by the same token, Taiwan cannot hope to defend itself in the long run without American help. \nAs an island, Taiwan is not just harder to invade than Ukraine, but also harder to support. Its ports might be destroyed by China, its own forces or even America\u2019s. Attempting to bring reinforcements or supplies to the island as Chinese missiles rain down would be almost as difficult as attempting to invade.\nAt the very least, America and Taiwan would need help from allies. Japan, which hosts tens of thousands of American troops, has capable forces. The Philippines is weak militarily but close to Taiwan. Australia is closely allied but modestly armed and farther away. Countries in the Pacific could provide rear bases. More distant allies, such as Britain, might send naval vessels. A big uncertainty is how much India would help. A lot would depend on how the crisis unfolds and who is blamed for it.\n\nAmerica\u2019s plans to help Taiwan used to hinge on aircraft-carriers. It sent one to the area after China fired missiles near Taiwan in 1995 and again after another salvo in 1996. But China has since invested heavily in \u201canti-access/area-denial\u201d (A2/AD) weapons, designed to fend off American ships and aircraft. They include the DF-26 missile, which can strike deep into the Pacific (see map 2), and new hypersonic missiles that are harder to intercept. China\u2019s navy is now the world\u2019s largest, with a fleet of submarines to attack approaching American ships. Its long-range bombers are also a menace. David Ochmanek of the RAND Corporation, a think-tank that has run classified war-games simulating a Taiwan conflict, argues that old American strategies now \u201clead to defeat\u201d. \nAmerican planners\u2019 alternative is summed up with three D\u2019s: disrupt Chinese operations within the first island chain, defend allies on it and dominate the sea and air beyond. America must overcome daunting problems: the \u201ctyranny of distance\u201d in the vast Pacific Ocean, the growth of China\u2019s \u201cweapons engagement zone\u201d to encompass American bases in the western Pacific and the sheer mass of China\u2019s manpower and weapons, which exceeds America\u2019s in many categories.\n\nThe risk of Chinese attack, by missiles or bombers, decreases with distance (see chart). But even Guam, America\u2019s big military hub some 3,000km from China, is vulnerable. What is more, America\u2019s air defence is worryingly thin. It also has few means of passive defence, such as concrete aircraft hangars.\nAmerican officers speak of the prospect of war with a mixture of dread at China\u2019s growing power (\u201cEvery day I am astounded by their capabilities,\u201d says one), and optimism that new tactics can achieve victory. They emphasise \u201cdistributed lethality\u201d, meaning the scattering and constant movement of forces to avoid becoming easy targets, while maintaining the capacity to gather or co-ordinate in attacks. This will rely to an unprecedented degree on America\u2019s experience of fighting as a \u201cjoint force\u201d, in which separate military branches and weapons systems reinforce each other.\nMilitary jets would disperse from big bases, gather in the air for battle and settle where they can on specks of land. They would repeat the pattern as quickly as possible by \u201chot-pit\u201d refuelling with engines running. Sometimes planes would perch in civilian airports; sometimes on austere airfields, many dating from the second world war, which are being refurbished. Adding ever more concrete to protect aircraft \u201cis a fool\u2019s errand\u201d, says Brigadier-General Paul Birch, commander of the 36th Wing at Andersen air base, in Guam. \u201cBeing in the air is much safer.\u201d\nEngineers, meanwhile, would aim to repair cratered runways within about six hours. Ground crews would set up pop-up hangars as well as traffic-control centres and data links. A big headache would be how to get fuel and munitions to the right places. One aim of this \u201cagile combat employment\u201d is to force China to expend its large but finite stock of missiles. \nRather than fight near Taiwan, American surface ships would probably hold back, to survive, provide air defence for Guam and other rear bases and blockade Chinese trade. They would \u201cpulse\u201d\u2014sailing briefly in and out of the danger zone\u2014to shoot at Chinese ships and planes.\nBrothers with arms\nMarines would deploy to \u201ckey maritime terrain\u201d, especially islands dominating the straits that separate Taiwan from Japan and the Philippines. They would reinforce the local troops, reconnoitre Chinese dispositions and, armed with new missiles coming into service in the next few months, fire on enemy ships. The marines are creating three new \u201cmarine littoral regiments\u201d, each with more than 2,000 troops, giving up their tanks and many of their howitzers.\nRead more of this package\nHow to avoid war over Taiwan\nSpecial report: Frontline Formosa\n\nSome critics say these units would be too vulnerable; others reckon that, without deployment to Taiwan itself, they would be too distant to help much in the main battle. The marines, though, argue that they would multiply the threats China must face, \u201ccanalise\u201d Chinese ships into vulnerable positions and, above all, \u201csense and make sense\u201d of Chinese deployments. General David Berger, the marines\u2019 commandant, talks of \u201cturning the tables\u201d on China by using an A2/AD strategy to defend the first island chain. America won\u2019t have to fight its way in, he says: \u201cWe are there persistently, 52 weeks a year.\u201d\nDispersed warfare sacrifices efficiency for resilience. To succeed, though, lots of things need to go well. First, command-and-control networks must be able to withstand Chinese electronic attack. Planners talk of a yet-to-be-perfected \u201ckill web\u201d, in which artificial intelligence helps \u201csensors\u201d and \u201dshooters\u201d\u2014including those of allies\u2014operate together even when far apart. Marines on islands, stealthy F-35 fighters, drones and more can all act as nodes. Second, America would need more sophisticated logistics to supply far-flung units. Last, it must persuade allies to risk China\u2019s wrath. Their willingness would become clear only as hostilities erupt, which complicates planning.\nEarly in the war the job of sinking China\u2019s invasion fleet\u2014the critical task in defending Taiwan\u2014would fall mainly to submarines and long-range bombers. Though its boats are outnumbered by China\u2019s, America retains the edge in underwater warfare. Its attack submarines carry torpedoes, cruise missiles and sea mines. Sooner or later, however, they would run out of munitions, and would have to sail away for several days to replenish in places such as Guam, where they would be vulnerable.\nToo far away\nBombers flying from Hawaii, Alaska and the American mainland, meanwhile, would be using munitions that can be fired from beyond the reach of Chinese anti-aircraft missiles. But America\u2019s Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles, which can travel 200 nautical miles or more, would probably run out within a week. Thereafter, American forces would have to move closer to Taiwan to sink ships. America\u2019s hope is that, by then, China has also run short of long-range munitions. \nAmerica and China would debate whether and when to attack each others\u2019 satellites, potentially turning low-earth orbit into a scrapyard. Some war-games suggest they might refrain from doing so for fear of harming themselves. But as a senior American military official puts it, \u201cThe side that shoots first gets a big advantage.\u201d\nEvery stage of the war would be fought in the shadow of nuclear weapons. Mr Biden has talked about reducing America\u2019s reliance on nukes, and China espouses \u201cno first use\u201d. But the risk of disaster is presumably rising as China expands its arsenal. It will grow from 400 or so warheads today, the Pentagon reckons, to 1,000-odd by 2030 (still less than America and Russia have). A recent war game conducted by the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank, suggested that both sides underestimate the risk of escalation. This grows if either attacks the other\u2019s mainland, or if the conflict becomes protracted. \nThe toll of even a purely conventional war would be devastating, for the victors as well as the losers. A war game by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, another American think-tank, found that under its \u201cbase scenario\u201d Taiwanese, American and Japanese forces typically severed PLA supply lines after about ten days, stranding some 30,000 Chinese troops on the island. Taiwan survived as an autonomous entity, but was left with no electricity or basic services. America and Japan suffered, too, losing 382 aircraft and 43 ships, including two American aircraft-carriers. China lost 155 planes and 138 ships.\nThe economic cost would be enormous, too. RAND estimated in 2016 that a year-long war over Taiwan would reduce China\u2019s GDP by 25-35% and America\u2019s by 5-10%. The Rhodium Group, a consultancy, concluded in 2022 that the disruption to the supply of semiconductors (Taiwan makes 90% of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips) would cause global shortages of electronic goods, leading to \u201cincalculable\u201d damage to the world economy.\nGiven the appalling consequences, would America and China really go to war? Chinese officials say their preferred option is still peaceful unification, and deny there is any timetable for an attack. China also has many options short of an all-out invasion. They include economic coercion, a full or partial blockade and the seizure of outlying islands such as Kinmen. China may well embark on this sort of \u201cgrey-zone\u201d operation as a substitute for, or a prelude to, a wider attack. \nMr Xi has strong incentives to bide his time, not least because his forces are growing, whereas American defence spending is near an 80-year low as a share of GDP. But he may also feel pressure to attack if Taiwan abandons all pretence that it might ever reconcile with the mainland, and formally declares independence, or if America deploys troops to Taiwan. The year-long conflict in Ukraine is proof that an irredentist autocrat can miscalculate appallingly. Zhou Bo, a former senior officer in the PLA, notes that to achieve its aims, China does not need to exceed America\u2019s global might; it just needs an edge in the western Pacific. \nMany strategists in America and Asia fear that the loss of Taiwan would replace the American-led order in the region with a Chinese-led one. Japan and South Korea might feel obliged to develop their own nuclear weapons. Rather than constraining China, the first island chain would become a platform for it to project power farther afield. \u201cTaiwan is the cork in the bottle,\u201d as an American military official puts it.\nAmerica draws solace from Russia\u2019s failures in Ukraine, believing they have increased Mr Xi\u2019s doubts about his ability to take Taiwan. But to preserve the precarious balance across the Taiwan Strait, America must act with exquisite skill. It needs to reinforce Mr Xi\u2019s hesitation by strengthening itself, its allies and Taiwan, but not go so far that he thinks he must attack fast or give up on seizing Taiwan for ever. \u25a0\nCorrection (March 11th 2023): The original version of the chart in this article had the wrong scale on the y-axis.
