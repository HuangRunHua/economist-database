When China launched military exercises around Taiwan after the Pelosi visit, many blamed the Taiwanese government and American politicians for provoking it, not China for threatening the island.\nRead more of this package\nHow to avoid war over Taiwan\nAmerica and China are preparing for a war over Taiwan\n\nSuch victim-blaming is in part a product of Chinese disinformation designed to upset Taiwanese society. But it also reflects Taiwan\u2019s history. Taiwan\u2019s official name is the Republic of China (ROC), which dates from 1912, when the Qing dynasty was overthrown. The nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) party incorporated Taiwan into the ROC in 1945. It fled to the island after losing the civil war in 1949, and then imposed an authoritarian one-party system and four decades of martial law, forcing the local population to speak Mandarin and to embrace a Chinese identity. \nOnly after Taiwan democratised fully in the late 1980s did a suppressed local identity re-emerge. Polls in 1992 found just 17.6% of respondents identifying as Taiwanese, against 25.5% as Chinese and 46.4% as both. By 2022 a similar poll by the Election Study Centre at National Chengchi University found 61% of respondents identifying as Taiwanese, 2.7% as Chinese, and 32.9% as both. Younger generations born after the lifting of martial law hold especially strong Taiwanese identity. Yet a minority of Taiwan\u2019s older generation still identifies with China and hopes one day to be part of the mother country. America\u2019s switch of recognition to communist China and its discouragement of Taiwan\u2019s independence have also fostered more mistrust of Washington. \nThe next presidential election is due in early 2024. Candidates will have to propose a new vision for Taiwan\u2019s future in a world of deepening Sino-American hostility. Looking at the identity polls, it might seem that Ms Tsai\u2019s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should win easily. Support for independence has grown and support for unification has dropped. KMT affiliation has fallen as DPP affiliation has risen.\nIdentity is not the only factor in Taiwan\u2019s politics. A plurality of Taiwanese are undecided on either party affiliation or on independence versus unification. Around 57% of respondents in recent polls support the \u201cstatus quo\u201d of de facto independence\u2014and no war. Yet voters may have to choose between one or the other: fighting for sovereignty or surrendering for peace. The Chinese Communist Party pushes the defeatist message that America is manipulating Taiwan\u2019s \u201cseparatist\u201d leaders to provoke China, and it will be their fault if China is \u201cforced\u201d to attack. Taiwanese should instead quietly co-operate with China against a deceitful West.\nTaiwan\u2019s youth may be inured to such propaganda. But they are the group with the lowest voter turnout. The highest turnout is among those aged 55-75, who include conservatives most likely to favour appeasement. \u201cVote for the DPP and your youth go to the battlefield. Vote for the KMT and there will be no cross-straits war,\u201d declared Ma Ying-jeou, a former president and KMT leader, before local elections in November, which the KMT won. Local elections may be more of a judgment on city- and county-level government than on policy to China. But the talk of war in this campaign was a preview of a larger debate about to take place in Taiwan.\nTaiwan is a democracy, so its future lies in its people\u2019s hands. But that makes it vulnerable to authoritarian exploitation. China is already promoting defeatist and divisive ideas in the Taiwanese media. It is up to the Taiwanese to unite against them. They must decide who they are, what they believe in, whether they will fight and what that might cost. They should value their freedoms enough to be ready to make sacrifices for them. That is a politically difficult message, though not an entirely new one. After all, the freedom they enjoy now also came at a price.\u25a0\nPhoto: I-Hwa ChenG", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "A vital island", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Special report"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/ak20usde603e242i79e6aq83sbjgoos9", "tegID": "ak20usde603e242i79e6aq83sbjgoos9", "headline": "Special report", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/27/sources-and-acknowledgments", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/18ks10lee8v23ud2njvov5dvbc13hd65", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Sources and acknowledgments", "subheadline": "Video games", "datePublished": "2023-03-27T11:22:34Z", "description": "", "image": {"main": null, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023-03-25", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/ltbc764bdoglaej0f90jlnr56t9rpfoo", "type": ["PublicationIssue", "Report", "SpecialReport"], "headline": "Insert coin", "subheadline": "Video games", "datePublished": "2023-03-25T00:00:00Z", "description": "As video games move from teenage distraction to universal pastime they are following the same path as other mass media, says Tom Wainwright", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230325_SRR.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 1684}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/20/ready-player-four-billion-the-rise-of-video-games", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/engqeafdqvs92dernjbfu98d7o5ub4ov", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Ready, player four billion: the rise of video games", "subheadline": "Insert coin", "datePublished": "2023-03-20T17:54:48Z", "description": "As video games move from teenage distraction to universal pastime they are following the path of other mass media, says Tom Wainwright", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230325_SRD001.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/20/battles-over-streaming-break-out-for-video-games", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/9ue4kodgdj79qo0fkst3ljue3j5jl9ua", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Battles over streaming break out for video games", "subheadline": "Distribution", "datePublished": "2023-03-20T17:54:48Z", "description": "Streaming subscriptions have revolutionised music and television.

Taiwan\u2019s young were previously subject to only four months of conscription. Starting from 2024, they will serve a year each, with improved training. \u201cNo one wants war,\u201d she said. \u201cBut peace will not fall from the sky.\u201d Taiwan must prepare for war, she added, to prevent it.\n\nMs Tsai\u2019s decision should not have been so difficult. That it was reflects a troubling reality: Taiwan has not made up its mind how or even whether to defend itself. It is at once the \u201cmost dangerous place in the world\u201d yet numb to China\u2019s threat. Only since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has serious debate about a possible Chinese invasion become normal. That is in part because China\u2019s Communist Party is engaged in an information war designed to sow confusion. It also reflects Taiwan\u2019s tortuous history and politics. \nWestern officials are already planning for Taiwan\u2019s possible struggle against China. Yet Taiwanese have no consensus on who they are, how they relate to China or if they should ever fight. Their future depends on how they answer these questions especially as the next presidential election approaches. \nChina sees Taiwan as a renegade province that it has threatened with invasion for more than 70 years. But until recently war seemed unlikely. With American help, Taiwan had the military edge throughout the 20th century, and an ambiguous but secure place within a peaceful Sino-American relationship. In the past decade, though, that relationship has flipped from economic co-operation into overt competition. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, speaks of national rejuvenation in terms of victory over America, and has expanded his army at an alarming pace. The People\u2019s Liberation Army has begun beating the Americans in war games. China boasts the largest navy in the world, with an expected force of 400 ships by 2025 (America has less than 300, Taiwan just 26). It has expanded its missile and nuclear arsenal to keep foreign forces away from the Taiwan strait.\nChina is also taking more \u201cgrey zone\u201d actions (threatening moves short of war). The number of Chinese warplanes crossing the strait\u2019s median line, an unofficial divider, and entering Taiwan\u2019s south-west air-defence identification zone, has almost doubled in the past two years. The figure rose especially sharply after Nancy Pelosi, who was then speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives, visited the island in August 2022. China acted out a mock blockade after her visit, firing missiles directly over Taiwan for the first time.\nWhile American officials prepare for a worst-case scenario of all-out invasion, Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry is more concerned about \u201cgrey zone\u201d actions such as a blockade or the seizure of an outlying island. Taiwan\u2019s main island is roughly 160km away from the Chinese coast, but the island of Kinmen is only 3km away. Kinmen has been a conduit of cross-strait tourism and economic exchange. It has been importing water from China through a 16km pipeline ever since 2018. Some of those who urge Taiwan to prepare for invasion have suggested that, after seeing the impact of sanctions on Russia because of its attack on Ukraine, China would need a quick conquest of Taiwan, not a drawn-out conflict. Taiwanese officials worry that grey zone actions might serve as an early test of international will. America might well fight China to defend Taiwan\u2014but would anyone fight for Kinmen?\nAs Chinese pressure on Taiwan grows, the Taiwanese look for the world\u2019s support. Taiwan stands \u201cat the vanguard of the global defence of democracy\u201d, Ms Tsai has said. To let it go under would be a devastating step towards the might-is-right world that both Mr Xi and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin seem to favour. \nTaiwan\u2019s leaders know that neither strong democracy nor economic importance is enoughTaiwan also has outsize importance in the world economy. A conflict over Taiwan would do a lot more damage even than Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Taiwan makes more than 60% of the world\u2019s semiconductors, which power everything from mobile phones to guided missiles, and 90% of the most advanced sort. Rhodium Group, a research outfit, estimates that a Chinese blockade of Taiwan could cost the world economy more than $2trn.  \nFirst defend yourself\nTaiwan\u2019s leaders know that neither strong democracy nor economic importance is enough. The Ukraine war has taught them that a small country bullied by a bigger neighbour must demonstrate that it has the will to resist. Fight back, and there is more chance that the world will come to your aid. But Taiwan is not ready to fight. After decades of falling defence spending, its army has shrunk to a paltry 163,000 active soldiers (against China\u2019s 2m). It has more than 2m reservists, but can train only 110,000 of them each year. Taiwanese conscripts often liken their training time to \u201csummer camp\u201d, joking about sweeping floors and pulling up weeds, not learning to fire weapons. \nAmerican officials and retired Taiwanese military leaders worry about Taiwan\u2019s defence strategy. Its generals spend too much of their defence budget on fighter jets, tanks and battleships that may have been useful 30 years ago against a weaker China, but are now vulnerable to Chinese missiles. Taiwan\u2019s government repeats American talking-points about asymmetric warfare, the fighting a small country needs to defend itself against a larger enemy, but its army has yet to commit to it. Ms Tsai\u2019s announcements of conscription and training reform are a step forward, but not enough.\nThe most threatening Chinese attack against Taiwan may be psychological. Since the Ukraine war began, Taiwanese media have been flooded with conspiracy theories and Chinese propaganda stirring mistrust of America. NATO backed Russia into a corner, it is often claimed, and is sacrificing Ukraine for American interests. Taiwan must beware of America pushing it to be the next Ukraine. Such stories are surprisingly widespread in Taiwan. When China launched military exercises around Taiwan after the Pelosi visit, many blamed the Taiwanese government and American politicians for provoking it, not China for threatening the island.\nRead more of this package\nHow to avoid war over Taiwan\nAmerica and China are preparing for a war over Taiwan\n\nSuch victim-blaming is in part a product of Chinese disinformation designed to upset Taiwanese society. But it also reflects Taiwan\u2019s history. Taiwan\u2019s official name is the Republic of China (ROC), which dates from 1912, when the Qing dynasty was overthrown. The nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) party incorporated Taiwan into the ROC in 1945. It fled to the island after losing the civil war in 1949, and then imposed an authoritarian one-party system and four decades of martial law, forcing the local population to speak Mandarin and to embrace a Chinese identity. \nOnly after Taiwan democratised fully in the late 1980s did a suppressed local identity re-emerge. Polls in 1992 found just 17.6% of respondents identifying as Taiwanese, against 25.5% as Chinese and 46.4% as both. By 2022 a similar poll by the Election Study Centre at National Chengchi University found 61% of respondents identifying as Taiwanese, 2.7% as Chinese, and 32.9% as both. Younger generations born after the lifting of martial law hold especially strong Taiwanese identity. Yet a minority of Taiwan\u2019s older generation still identifies with China and hopes one day to be part of the mother country. America\u2019s switch of recognition to communist China and its discouragement of Taiwan\u2019s independence have also fostered more mistrust of Washington. \nThe next presidential election is due in early 2024. Candidates will have to propose a new vision for Taiwan\u2019s future in a world of deepening Sino-American hostility. Looking at the identity polls, it might seem that Ms Tsai\u2019s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should win easily. Support for independence has grown and support for unification has dropped. KMT affiliation has fallen as DPP affiliation has risen.\nIdentity is not the only factor in Taiwan\u2019s politics. A plurality of Taiwanese are undecided on either party affiliation or on independence versus unification. Around 57% of respondents in recent polls support the \u201cstatus quo\u201d of de facto independence\u2014and no war. Yet voters may have to choose between one or the other: fighting for sovereignty or surrendering for peace. The Chinese Communist Party pushes the defeatist message that America is manipulating Taiwan\u2019s \u201cseparatist\u201d leaders to provoke China, and it will be their fault if China is \u201cforced\u201d to attack. Taiwanese should instead quietly co-operate with China against a deceitful West.\nTaiwan\u2019s youth may be inured to such propaganda. But they are the group with the lowest voter turnout. The highest turnout is among those aged 55-75, who include conservatives most likely to favour appeasement. \u201cVote for the DPP and your youth go to the battlefield. Vote for the KMT and there will be no cross-straits war,\u201d declared Ma Ying-jeou, a former president and KMT leader, before local elections in November, which the KMT won. Local elections may be more of a judgment on city- and county-level government than on policy to China. But the talk of war in this campaign was a preview of a larger debate about to take place in Taiwan.\nTaiwan is a democracy, so its future lies in its people\u2019s hands. But that makes it vulnerable to authoritarian exploitation. China is already promoting defeatist and divisive ideas in the Taiwanese media. It is up to the Taiwanese to unite against them. They must decide who they are, what they believe in, whether they will fight and what that might cost. They should value their freedoms enough to be ready to make sacrifices for them. That is a politically difficult message, though not an entirely new one. After all, the freedom they enjoy now also came at a price.\u25a0\nPhoto: I-Hwa ChenG", "description": "Taiwan\u2019s fate will, ultimately, be decided by the battle-readiness of its people, says
