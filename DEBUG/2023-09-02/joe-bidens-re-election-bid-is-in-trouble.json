indictment for 91 felonies in four criminal cases, and he probably is, as one of his primary opponents remarked during the recent Republican debate, the most disliked politician in America. Democrats have reason to be smug at the prospect of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee\u2014unless they take a hard look at the vulnerabilities of their own standard-bearer. \nFewer than one in four Americans (24%) want President Joe Biden to run again, according to a poll published on August 17th by the Associated Press. Even 55% of Democrats do not think he should run. Although his approval rating has ticked up, he remains one of the most unpopular presidents in modern history. \nMr Biden\u2019s problems are obscured by the drama around Donald Trump\u2019s arrests and the Republican nominating contest. But that is also becoming a problem for the current president: he needs to capture the country\u2019s attention if he hopes to recapture its imagination. Only Jimmy Carter and Donald Trump himself\u2014both one-term presidents, at least so far\u2014had net-negative ratings worse than Mr Biden\u2019s at this point in their presidencies, according to an analysis of aggregated polls by the political publication FiveThirtyEight. In late August, its summary of public polls showed that 42% of Americans approved of the job Mr Biden was doing, whereas 53% disapproved.\nHis standing is even worse on the matter Americans care about most, his handling of the economy. The same Associated Press poll found that just 36% approve of his economic stewardship. It is hard to know which half of \u201cBidenomics\u201d inspires them less.\n On issues such as crime, corruption in government and immigration, surveys suggest Mr Biden\u2019s Republican opponent will have plenty of unhappiness to work with. Even in solidly blue New York, an influx of asylum-seekers\u2014some bused from Republican border states\u2014is souring Democrats on the president. Fewer than half of New Yorkers would vote for Mr Biden in a contest with Mr Trump, according to a recent Siena College poll. Mr Biden still led Mr Trump, 47% to 34% (with lots of abstentions). But that is a lousy margin for a Democrat in New York, far less than the 25-point minimum lead Mr Biden held in 2020.  \nTo the president\u2019s partisans, all this is unfair. They rightly note the economy is vibrant. Unemployment, at 3.5%, is near a 50-year low, inflation has come down and real wages have been rising, at least for the poor. Homicide rates are falling in American cities. Although Republicans predicted chaos at the southern border after Mr Biden ended covid-era restrictions in May, a new border regime imposed by Mr Biden appears to be keeping such crossings below levels recorded before then. Mr Biden has adeptly led the international response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and amassed a formidable record of bipartisan legislation. \nBut the president seems stuck with impressions formed in his first two years in office. His approval rating has never recovered since it crashed during America\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan two years ago. That same summer of 2021 he dismissed inflation as \u201ctemporary\u201d. For months into 2022, he pursued progressives\u2019 fondest and costliest policy goals before settling for the still-ambitious Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cIt made him look like he was pursuing liberal goals and was ineffective at doing it,\u201d says Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster. \u201cAnd it made moderates feel like they\u2019d been sold a bill of goods.\u201d Mr Biden\u2019s position has continued to deteriorate with the working-class voters, of whatever race, whom he will need in such battleground states as Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.\nThe collapse of Hunter Biden\u2019s plea agreement with prosecutors this summer means that publicity about his sordid traffic in the family name will continue to cloud Mr Biden\u2019s own image of decency, and of his efforts to restore integrity to government. Student-loan repayments, suspended for more than three years because of the pandemic, are due to resume on October 1st. A national carworkers\u2019 strike is looming. \nDemocrats will rally to Mr Biden, and he has time to woo others. Yet every day that goes by his party\u2019s biggest gamble, on his continued good health and acuity, also grows riskier. In 2020 voters embraced the idea that his age and experience made him a steady hand. Now they seem primed to see the slightest gaffe or stumble as confirmation that he is becoming unsteady. According to an AP poll at the end of August, 77% of Americans think Mr Biden is too old to serve effectively. His vice-president, Kamala Harris, has an even lower approval rating than he does.\nJoe versus the volcano\nMr Biden has been trying to improve voters\u2019 views of \u201cBidenomics\u201d and of him. So far, a big push that began in June has had little obvious benefit. In late August his campaign began a four-month, $25m advertising blitz of seven battleground states. The first advertisement touts America\u2019s pandemic recovery and a resurgence of manufacturing. \u201cAmerica is back!\u201d Mr Biden declares, as though to pre-empt any claim it might need to be made great again.\nBeyond trying to persuade Americans they have it pretty good, Mr Biden will count on the fight over abortion rights and, most of all, on Mr Trump\u2019s greater unpopularity to motivate dispirited Democrats and win over the dwindling cadre of swing voters in the dwindling number of swing states. \n\u201cDon\u2019t compare me to the Almighty,\u201d Mr Biden likes to say. \u201cCompare me to the alternative.\u201d Well, Mr Biden will probably lose if Republicans prove sane enough to supply an alternative such as Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, and the candidate who called out Mr Trump\u2019s unpopularity. But he could well lose anyway. Democrat or not, anyone committed to the success of the American experiment should be hoping for a Republican nominee not named Trump. \u25a0\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misnamed the Inflation Reduction Act\nRead more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics:\nHow Donald Trump won the debate he skipped (Aug 24th)\nThe case for a third-party campaign in 2024 is actuarial, not ideological (Jul 20th)\nJoe Biden should run against the Ivy League (Jul 12th)\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.
