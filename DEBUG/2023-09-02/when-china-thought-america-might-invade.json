"When foreign foes threaten, an impregnable fortress is worth more than a comfortable home. Time and again, that doctrine guided China\u2019s Communist Party in its first decades of rule. Under Chairman Mao Zedong, talk of invasion was a constant. In those dark times, the usual priorities of peacetime government\u2014feeding and clothing the masses, striving to raise living standards\u2014were all too often neglected. In their stead came campaigns to ready China for war. \nOne such campaign built a complete military-industrial complex in China\u2019s inland mountains, known as the \u201cThird Front\u201d. Begun in 1964, it was a state secret for more than a decade, though it involved at least 15m workers and consumed resources at a fearsome rate. Chinese elsewhere paid an unwitting price in austerity and consumer shortages. Labourers were often recruited from coastal or border regions deemed at risk of attack by America, India, the Soviet Union and other hostile powers. Grouped into militarised brigades, they laid railways far into China\u2019s rugged western and south-western interior. They built steelworks and mines, armaments factories and nuclear sites in remote valleys and deserts, some of them underground. Though rail lines and other infrastructure helped to open up inland China, the costs, both human and financial, were staggering. When the campaign wound down in the late 1970s, most Third Front projects were deemed unviable and were scrapped, merged or moved.\nSome tough but rational party bosses\u2014among them Deng Xiaoping, the flinty survivor of several Maoist purges, and Mao\u2019s eventual successor\u2014tried to slow or shrink the Third Front when it was first mooted. Their resistance is ably described by Covell Meyskens, a historian at the Naval Postgraduate School in California, in his book \u201cMao\u2019s Third Front: The Militarisation of Cold War China\u201d. These relative pragmatists drafted a five-year plan that sought to restore orderly food production in rural areas and to develop modern factories, especially on the coast, to provide clothes and other necessities. Their plan was, in effect, a rebuke of Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward, an earlier exercise in grassroots radicalism that killed 30m people in a man-made famine.\nMao sensed opposition and counter-attacked. Party doctrine already described coastal development as a legacy of colonialism. Mao called coastal cities easy targets for foreign attack, too. He ordered key industries to move to remote mountain ranges, aping tactical retreats staged by early communist guerrillas. The country must build a rear base before war broke out, Mao insisted. Still, central planners and allies in the leadership played for time and called for more studies\u2014right up to the moment in August 1964 that America accused North Vietnam of attacking one its warships, bringing conflict and a superpower\u2019s armed forces to China\u2019s southern border. Mao used this security crisis to outflank other leaders, argues Mr Meyskens. Bowing to Mao as their supreme military strategist, top officials approved his most urgent priorities within days, including the building from scratch of Panzhihua, a steelmaking city in the mountains of the south-west, and a ban on new industrial projects in 15 coastal cities.\nHistory does not have to repeat perfectly to offer lessons in the present. Mao was a revolutionary who saw terror and anarchy as useful tools. By contrast, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s supreme leader, is an austere nationalist obsessed with order and party control. For his part, Mao seems to have relished China\u2019s break with the Soviet Union in the early 1960s and the turn to autarky that followed. Mr Xi\u2019s calls for self-reliance in food and in core technologies are more complicated. Even as his regime abhors dependency on America, its envoys tirelessly lobby Western allies in Asia and Europe to provide know-how that China needs to grow strong. For all those differences, the Third Front should be studied by blithe sorts who insist that Mr Xi\u2019s party must deliver growth and material prosperity to maintain its legitimacy, and so will never break with the rich West. Economic self-interest is a powerful force. But a lesson from 1964 is that once America seemed truly to threaten China, economic planners fell silent and security fanatics took charge.\nOnce, Panzhihua was too secret to appear on maps. Today, it is a sleepy city of 1.2m people in southern Sichuan, anchored by its still-active, state-owned steelworks, and by mines for iron ore, titanium and vanadium. Chaguan reached the city by high-speed train from Kunming, two and a half hours to the south. The Kunming-Chengdu rail line was also a Third Front project, cut through barren mountains at a cost of two deaths per kilometre of track. In the city centre high-arched bridges cross the Jinsha river, whose fast brown waters drowned pioneering workers crossing by boat. In the air, a faint oily tang is the only trace of the steelmaking that once poisoned local skies and water sources. \nIn a dangerous age, old instincts stir\nThe city\u2019s harsh beginnings are hard to imagine now: the lack of fresh food, the wolves that terrorised the first arrivals, the tents and huts of earth and straw that housed workers sent to terrace steep mountainsides. But several middle-aged residents are proud to recall fathers sent to the Third Front six decades ago, toiling alone for years before sending for wives and children to join them. \nA phrase of Mao\u2019s, \u201cUntil Panzhihua is built, I won\u2019t sleep\u201d, is carved on a boulder outside the city\u2019s Museum of the Third Front, near another old slogan: \u201cGood People and Good Horses Go to the Third Front\u201d. Inside, a father and his 12-year-old son from Guangxi, in China\u2019s far south, examine a life-size diorama of a mine entrance. Grumbling that today\u2019s young take comfort for granted, the man brought his son to discover how earlier generations endured hardship. He praises Mr Xi for updating Mao\u2019s calls for self-reliance, predicting that a global contest for resources is \u201cdefinitely going to cause a war\u201d. Not all Chinese feel such danger. For those that do, Panzhihua awaits their visit. \u25a0\nRead more from Chaguan, our columnist on China:\nThe world should study China\u2019s crushing of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms (Aug
