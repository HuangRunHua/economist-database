for more Americans", "section": "Europe", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/28/why-europe-is-a-magnet-for-more-americans", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "\u201cWHAT I ENVY you is your liberty,\u201d says Count Valentin de Bellegarde to Christopher Newman, the protagonist of Henry James\u2019s novel \u201cThe American\u201d. Rich, self-made and free of class prejudice, Newman moves to Paris for fun, only to be sucked into the intrigues of the French aristocracy. The template still describes one type of American expat: the well-off innocent who comes to Europe for amusement or edification. Another sort, however, comes not to enjoy the old world but to escape the new one. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what would happen to me in France,\u201d said James Baldwin, a black writer, of his decision to emigrate in 1948, \u201cbut I knew what would happen to me in New York.\u201d\nMore Americans are moving to Europe lately, and many are fleers rather than seekers. The statistics are messy, but in some countries the trend is clear. In 2013-22 the number of Americans in the Netherlands increased from about 15,500 to 24,000; in Portugal it tripled to almost 10,000; and in Spain it rose from about 20,000 to nearly 34,000. In other places, such as France, Germany and the Nordic countries, the number grew moderately or held steady. Britain thinks the number of resident Americans rose from 137,000 in 2013 to 166,000 in 2021 (the latest estimate).\n\nMeanwhile, more and more Americans say they want out of their own country. Few of those who vowed to leave if Donald Trump were elected in 2016 actually did so. But Gallup, a pollster, found in 2018 that the share of Americans who said they would like to move permanently to another country had risen from 11% under Barack Obama to 16% under Mr Trump; by 2022 it was 17%, Joe Biden\u2019s election notwithstanding.  The follow-through rate remains tiny: a few tens of thousands of \u00e9migr\u00e9s out of a population of 330m. But many recent expats say they left partly out of despair at where the United States is heading.\n\u201cI do a phone call once a month with Americans asking me how to come over here,\u201d says Caroline Behringer, an American who moved in 2017. Ms Behringer, a former aide to Nancy Pelosi, the then leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, left her job and joined her partner in Amsterdam after Mr Trump\u2019s victory. For most expats, she says, politics was not so much the reason they left as a reason not to go back: \u201cNot just the election, but the continued divisiveness\u201d.\n\u201cThe thing we hear all the time is that the work-life balance is so much better here,\u201d says Tracy Metz, who heads the John Adams Institute, an American-Dutch cultural venue. American workers toil for 1,811 hours a year, Europeans just 1,571; the well-rested Dutch put in a mere 1,427. The Netherlands once attracted Yanks seeking to smoke marijuana or marry same-sex partners. Now the attractions are more mainstream, Ms Metz says. The rise of international English makes things easier for Americans, who are notoriously bad at languages: 28% of the bachelor\u2019s programmes at Dutch universities are in English. Online job ads require English almost as frequently as they require Dutch.\nSome \u00e9migr\u00e9s are drawn to Europe\u2019s robust social safety-nets. Heather Caldwell Urquhart, a writer who moved to Lisbon in 2021, had taken a clerical job in Massachusetts simply to get health insurance. In Portugal she and her family pay for coverage a fraction of what an equivalent American plan would cost. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise how shredded the United States\u2019 social fabric was until we got here,\u201d she says.\n\u201cWe felt the tension lift\u201d within weeks of leaving America, agrees Sylvia Johnson, a psychiatrist who moved to Lisbon in 2022. For Ms Johnson and her family, who are black, the central issues were racism and violence. She had been trying for years to persuade her husband Stanley, a lawyer, to move abroad. The strife after the murder of George Floyd in 2021 brought him around. He recalls saying: \u201c\u2018I think we need to get a gun.\u2019 When I said that out loud, I was like, if I have to live in a country where I need a gun to protect my family, then this is not the country for me.\u201d\nStanley had a cross burned on his lawn while growing up in Virginia. Several of Sylvia\u2019s relatives were killed by guns. Now they are relaxing some of the wariness that black Americans develop for detecting prejudice and coping with police. Though there is some racism in Portugal, they say, they do not worry about violence.\nOther factors are more prosaic. The huge increase in remote working during the pandemic made living abroad more feasible. And the European countries that lure the most Americans have set up tempting deals for foreigners. The Netherlands lets companies exempt 30% of skilled foreign workers\u2019 income from taxes. In Portugal a residential visa requires income of just 150% of the national minimum wage, or about \u20ac1,100 ($1,190) a month\u2014an easy hurdle for American retirees. Foreigners can pay a 10% flat tax on \u201cpassive income\u201d, such as investments or a pension. Spain\u2019s \u201cBeckham law\u201d offers a 24% flat tax for income earned in the country. Several countries are introducing \u201cdigital nomad\u201d visas for tech freelancers.\nSuch deals explain why these places are getting a lot of non-rich American expats. Other countries target the Christopher Newmans of the world. Italy aims to attract \u201chigh-net-worth individuals\u201d by letting them pay \u20ac100,000 a year in income tax regardless of how much they earn. France has a complicated exemption aimed at foreign business executives. Germany, though, has none.\nFor all American expats\u2019 tales of disillusion, it is less important than practical matters. \u201cEverybody has convoluted how-I-ended-up-here stories,\u201d says Amanda Klekowski von Koppenfels of the University of Kent, an expert on the American diaspora. Many travel for education or work, fall in love and settle down. Still, she says, there has been a change. Americans once felt that their country was the ultimate immigrant nation; leaving seemed odd. Now they are aware that Europe has its advantages: \u201cGood health care, better transportation, less gun violence, there\u2019s racism but a lot less deadly.\u201d\nTo listen to the new American expats is to get a sense that \u201cThe American\u201d has been partly upended. Americans are still richer than Europeans. But when they come to the continent, they no longer arrive as egalitarians in lands of aristocracy and prejudice. Instead they admire Europe\u2019s universal health care, efficient public transport, lower crime and lower income inequality. In a way, they envy the Europeans\u2019 liberty. \u25a0", "description": "The number seeking to escape violence and political strife in the United States is small but growing", "ogDescription": "The
