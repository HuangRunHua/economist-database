show to describe decades of vicious abuse by her husband: wild jealousy, beatings and isolation. Two weeks later she was found tied to a chair and burned to death by the man she had denounced. Spain was shocked not only by her murder, but also by the fact that she had called the police many times, to no avail.\nCompared with such abuse, the kiss Luis Rubiales planted on an unwilling Jenni Hermoso on August 20th might seem trivial. Ms Hermoso and Spain\u2019s women\u2019s football team had just won the World Cup, and while passing out medals, Mr Rubiales, the head of the RFEF, Spain\u2019s football federation, grabbed the back of her head, pulled her towards him and planted his mouth on hers. A \u201cpeck\u201d, he later said, and consensual. \nShe disagrees. The uproar that has consumed Spain since shows how machista the country still is, say many Spanish feminists. But the uproar can also be taken as an example of just how feminist the country has become. When Spain\u2019s first modern left-wing government (1982-96) pulled Spain into Europe, Spanish society went on an orgy of personal liberalisation; but in Spanish life, sexism was slow to fade. By contrast, the second Socialist government, that of Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero (2003-11), quickly set about passing a gender-violence law, filling half the cabinet with women and liberalising abortion. It also introduced gay marriage and other laws in a burst of progress so sudden that it has been called the \u201csecond transition\u201d, after the first one following Francisco Franco\u2019s death in 1975. \nIn today\u2019s politics, Spanish women are doing extraordinarily well. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the prime minister, boasts a cabinet not just featuring women, but dominated by them: all three deputy prime ministers, and the ministers of economy, finance, labour, justice, defence and industry, as well as those ministries traditionally given to women, such as education and social affairs. Ministers, male and female, have been unanimous in calling for Mr Rubiales to go. Nor is their disgust a left-wing monopoly. The star figure of the conservative opposition, Madrid\u2019s regional president, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, is known for her delight in skewering left-wing pieties. But even she has called Mr Rubiales\u2019s behaviour \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. \nPolitical progress is reflected, though unevenly, in society. The press extensively reports on violence against women, and the radio frequently reminds women of the hotline they can call to report it. The streets fill with huge demonstrations on March 8th, International Women\u2019s Day. Sexual freedom for women and men is taken for granted. Last year a law banned street harassment, in the country once known for piropos: florid compliments offered to a woman in public.\nAll this is why asqueroso (\u201cdisgusting\u201d) trended on social media moments after Mr Rubiales forced his mouth on to Ms Hermoso\u2019s, and #SeAcabo (\u201cIt\u2019s over\u201d) has become the Spanish equivalent of #MeToo. Though it is not, obviously, over, the tide has surely turned. Those who seem not to have detected that include Mr Rubiales\u2019s mother, who locked herself into a church and declared a hunger strike in support of her son (she was later taken to hospital). To barricade oneself in a church is something that would occur to fewer and fewer Spaniards, among whom religious practice has declined about as quickly as feminism has grown.\nBut being locked in a conservative bastion is a good metaphor for the reaction of the Spanish football federation. On August 25th Mr Rubiales gave a speech in which he was widely expected to resign. Instead he declared his refusal to do so, blaming a \u201cfalse feminism\u201d for the predicament he was in. The audience that heartily applauded him included the trainers of the women\u2019s and men\u2019s national teams, leading to calls for them to quit too. \nSpanish sport is not unusually sexist. Women athletes are closely followed and their victories celebrated: last year Barcelona\u2019s women\u2019s team broke its own world attendance record for a women\u2019s event, packing 91,600 fans into Camp Nou for its 5-1 rout of Wolfsburg in the Champions League semi-final. The national team\u2019s World Cup win dominated newspaper front pages in the same way that the men\u2019s title did in 2010. \nInequality does persist in pay. A long-running saga over the lower earnings of the women\u2019s national team relative to the men provided a backdrop of disgruntlement to the tournament. But such complaints are common in other countries too.\nBored with the board\nThe area of Spanish life that remains most stubbornly stuck in the past\u2014besides the Catholic leadership, dominated by ultraconservatives\u2014is business. A study from 2017 found that just 22% of top executive positions were held by women, a bit better than in Britain or America but worse than the 35% average in euro-zone countries. (Its authors blame policies that make it hard to combine parenting and work.) And surely enough, at the RFEF, a business as much as a sporting body, just 9% of the governing board are women. Such clubbishness may explain more than anything the roomful of men applauding Mr Rubiales\u2019s rant against feminism. Some of that audience seem to have wised up subsequently. The two national trainers who first clapped have since denounced Mr Rubiales. On August 28th the regional football bodies that make up the national one unanimously called for Mr Rubiales to go.\nFifty years ago, Spanish women were second-class citizens. Twenty-five years ago, they were shocked by Ana Orantes\u2019s murder into demanding social progress to match their legal emancipation. Today, attitudes often seem to resemble those in Scandinavia more than in neighbouring countries, where vigorous feminist movements still face strong headwinds. #MeToo has led to progress in France and, to a lesser extent, Italy. But in Spain the push began long ago, and has won broad and deep social approval\u2014however slow those like Mr Rubiales have been to notice it. \u25a0\nClarification (August 30th 2023): Abortion was not first introduced under Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero in 2010. It was decriminalised under Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez in 1985 in cases including rape, the health of the mother or fetal deformity, and permission was often liberally granted. The law of 2010 introduced the right to a free choice by the mother alone, in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.\nCorrection (August 30th 2023): Barcelona packed 91,600 fans into Camp Nou for last year\u2019s Champions League semi-final, not for the final.\nRead more from Charlemagne, our columnist on European politics: \nItaly\u2019s beaches are a battleground of the European economy (Aug 24th)\nHaving shaken off nationalism, Europe risks civilisationalism (Aug 17th)\nThe Baltic is delighted to be a NATO lake (Aug 10th)\nAlso: How the Charlemagne column got its name", "description": "Much of society has left outdated attitudes behind.
