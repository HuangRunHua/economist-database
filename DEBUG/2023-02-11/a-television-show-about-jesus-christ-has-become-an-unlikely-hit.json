"Article", "articleBody": "ONE SUNNY afternoon last summer, Jesus walked onto a field near Dallas, Texas, and with just a few loaves of bread and a couple of fish, fed a crowd of 5,000. In truth, the miraculous meal had been rustled up by television producers: the pita bread came from local grocery stores and the croaker, a silvery fish abundant in the Atlantic Ocean, was supplied by Asian-American supermarkets. But none of these earthly details mattered once the cameras started rolling and Jesus, played by Jonathan Roumie, lifted his eyes to heaven and blessed the meal.\nThe miracle of the loaves and fishes, first recorded in the Gospels, is dramatised in \u201cThe Chosen\u201d, a tv show about Jesus Christ and his followers. It is produced by a fledgling studio. The director had not previously been blessed with success. The actors were unknown. Yet it has become a hit, and recently released its third season.\nThe show\u2019s success is revealing. It attests to the popularity and profitability of Christian entertainment. It also highlights how film-makers of faith can circumvent Hollywood\u2019s godless gatekeepers. \nNeal Harmon, head of Angel Studios, the distributor of the show, says almost 110m people have watched it on their free apps; many more have seen it on streaming platforms including Amazon Prime, Netflix and YouTube, where certain seasons of \u201cThe Chosen\u201d are available. Angel Studios released the first two episodes of the new season in American cinemas in November. The double-bill made nearly $9m in its opening weekend and ranked third in the box-office charts, ahead of \u201cBlack Adam\u201d, a superhero movie, and \u201cTicket to Paradise\u201d, a rom-com starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts.\nMost depictions of the life of Jesus dwell on his divinity, but \u201cThe Chosen\u201d focuses on his ordinariness. \u201cWe have put Jesus on stained-glass windows,\u201d says Dallas Jenkins, the show\u2019s creator and director, yet \u201cwhat makes the story of the Gospels so powerful is, in fact, his humanity.\u201d Viewers watch Jesus cooking, playing with children or brushing his teeth. He cracks jokes, too. Asked at a wedding if he can help one of his acolytes improve his dance moves, he quips: \u201cSome things even I cannot do.\u201d\nThe disciples, meanwhile, lead unhappy lives. When they meet Jesus for the first time, they are seeking deliverance from worldly woes, not salvation after death. Simon is a debt-ridden gambler with a dodgy marriage. Mary Magdalene\u2019s struggle with otherworldly demons has driven her to alcoholism and thoughts of suicide. Matthew, a taxman, is caught between the Roman authorities and his countrymen. \nMr Jenkins uses creative licence when weaving characters\u2019 stories together. Matthew, for example, is responsible for making Simon pay his debts. Thomas, another disciple, runs a wine business which Jesus saves from ruin thanks to his ability to transmogrify water. Nicodemus, a Pharisee, meets Jesus through Mary Magdalene, on whom he had tried to perform an exorcism. None of this material can be found in the Gospels, but Mr Jenkins and the show\u2019s writers have consulted with three Bible teachers\u2014a Catholic priest, an evangelical professor and a Messianic Jew\u2014to determine whether their plots are plausible.\nFaith is not a prerequisite for enjoying \u201cThe Chosen\u201d, Mr Jenkins argues: non-Christian viewers \u201ccan appreciate these stories in the same way that, if you don\u2019t believe in the Force, you can still appreciate \u2018Star Wars\u2019.\u201d Some may find his approach too playful, or insufficiently faithful to scripture. Indeed, some evangelicals have taken to YouTube to decry scenes in which Jesus rehearses his sermons or makes light of his divinity. Mr Jenkins, himself a devout evangelical Christian, maintains that the show is reverent of the man from Nazareth. Jesus\u2019s humanity \u201cdoesn\u2019t detract from his divinity. In many ways, it makes it even more awe-inspiring,\u201d he says. \u201cThe creator of the universe actually lived among us.\u201d\nThe film-maker believes in miracles, and some might see a minor one in the way he made the show. After Mr Jenkins\u2019s first major theatrical project, \u201cThe Resurrection of Gavin Stone\u201d (2017), flopped at the box office, he was not sure if he \u201chad a future in the business any more\u201d. \u201cThe Chosen\u201d revived his career and Mr Roumie\u2019s. The actor was on the verge of quitting the industry. Now, when millions of Christians think of Jesus, they may picture his face.\n\u201cThe Chosen\u201d also saved Angel Studios\u2019 predecessor, VidAngel. Before the show took off, the company was facing bankruptcy when several Hollywood studios sued it for copyright violations. (VidAngel allowed users to filter out disagreeable scenes of nudity or violence from films and TV shows; it reached a settlement with the studios in 2020.)\nFilm and television executives, a secular bunch, have long shunned religious projects. But there are ways to bring pious plots to the screen without their say-so. Studios did not see much commercial potential in \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d, a blood-spattered biblical drama of 2004, and Mel Gibson, the director, ended up footing the bill himself. (The film went on to gross more than $600m worldwide.) In contrast, the producers of \u201cThe Chosen\u201d have persuaded fans of devotional drama to chip in. To make the first season, they collected $10m via crowd-funding\u2014at the time setting a record for a media project. In the main the show is still financed in this way; its website indicates how many episodes have been bankrolled. \nThe fundraising model creates a bond with fans and they get rewards for digging into their pockets, such as the opportunity to appear on the show. More than 9,000 flocked to Texas to be extras in the scene where Jesus feeds the crowd. Mr Jenkins regularly posts updates and behind-the-scenes looks for fans. \nNearly four years after the show had its premiere, the success of \u201cThe Chosen\u201d baffles Mr Jenkins. It doesn\u2019t \u201cmake much sense,\u201d he says. Then again, \u201cneither does the story of the feeding of the 5,000.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly
