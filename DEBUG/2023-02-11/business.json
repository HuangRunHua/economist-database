of disruption, with various announcements that chatbots based on artificial intelligence are to be incorporated into search engines. Microsoft unveiled a version of Bing with the technology that powers ChatGPT, made by OpenAI, a startup, in which Microsoft is a big investor.  Finding itself on the back foot, Google launched Bard, its rival to ChatGPT. However, the company\u2019s share price fell sharply when Bard gave the wrong answer to a question on space telescopes in a video promoting its abilities. \nGame over?\nIt was a mixed week for Microsoft, which received another blow to its planned takeover of Activision Blizzard, a maker of video games. Britain\u2019s competition regulator said the deal would be bad for consumers, and may not approve it. America\u2019s Federal Trade Commission is already suing to block the acquisition. \nSome of the companies in the embattled Adani Group reported a rise in profits. That prompted a rally in their share prices after a two-week rout sparked by a short-seller\u2019s claim that the stock was being artificially inflated (Adani denies the allegation). Adani\u2019s controlling shareholders attempted to soothe markets by repaying a $1.1bn loan ahead of schedule. \nDisney announced a restructuring of its business in which 7,000 jobs will be cut, around 3% of its workforce. It is the company\u2019s first big move since Bob Iger returned as chief executive in November. He said the changes would reshape Disney \u201caround creativity\u201d and make its streaming business profitable. \nThe great shake-out continued in the tech industry, as Zoom announced that it would cut 15% of its workforce, or 1,300 jobs. Eric Yuan, the chief executive, said he would take a cut to his salary and bonus. The company\u2019s headcount has tripled in two years, while post-pandemic demand for its video-conference services has slowed dramatically. \nInvestors seem to be enthused by the extensive cost-cutting at America\u2019s tech giants. Despite Apple reporting a 5% year-on-year drop in revenue for the last three months of 2022, which includes the crucial Christmas season, and Google posting a sharper-than-expected decline in advertising revenue, the Nasdaq composite held steady. The index is up by 15% since the start of the year. \n\nBritain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit new record highs, surpassing its previous peak of May 2018. The Footsie outshone its American and European peers last year and has risen by 6% since the beginning of this year. \nThe FTSE 100\u2019s gains have come on the back of a surge in the share price BP, which announced a record annual profit, of $27.7bn. The company increased its dividend and share buy-back programme. But it lowered its target for cutting fossil-fuel production, from 40% by 2030 to 25%. Like others in the industry, BP is squeezed between keeping shareholders happy with high returns from pumping oil and gas and the push towards a net-zero economy. \u201cWe\u2019re responding to what society wants,\u201d mused its boss, Bernard Looney. \nTotalEnergies (formerly Total) also reported a record annual profit of $20.5bn, or $36bn on an adjusted basis. The combined profits for 2022 of the five biggest Western oil companies have now reached almost $200bn. \nRussia\u2019s revenues from oil and gas fell by 46% in January, year on year, according to the finance ministry. With its spending on the war in Ukraine soaring, Russia\u2019s monthly budget deficit ballooned to 1.76trn roubles ($25bn).\nCredit Suisse reported an annual loss of SFr7.3bn ($7.9bn), its biggest since the global financial crisis of 2007-09. The Swiss bank was hit by a surge in withdrawals from wealthy clients in October. \nA jury found that Elon Musk was not liable for losses incurred by a group of shareholders because of the market reaction in 2018 to his tweet about taking Tesla private, which did not happen. Mr Musk said he believed he had secured the funding to buy out the carmaker at the time of the tweet. The verdict vindicates his decision to fight the case rather than settle. \nAmerican employers created 517,000 jobs last month, the highest number for January since 1946 and well above the market forecast. Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that given strong data on the labour market and the economy, the central bank may have to prolong interest-rate rises for longer than investors might expect. \nSans Son\nSoftBank\u2019s Vision Funds reported another big quarterly loss, of $5.5bn. It is a tough time for the Japanese conglomerate\u2019s investments, which have plunged in value as tech stocks and startup valuations have slid. Its investments in new ventures have all but dried up. Son Masayoshi, the company\u2019s boss, missed his usually exuberant earnings presentation. We hope that he will once again appear, said the chief financial officer, but we don\u2019t know when.", "description": "", "ogDescription": "", "imageUrl":
