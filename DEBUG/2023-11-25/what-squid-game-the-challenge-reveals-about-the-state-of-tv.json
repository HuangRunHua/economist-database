face turns crimson as he focuses on the fiendish task at hand. Using a needle, he and his fellow players must try to extricate an umbrella shape stamped into a circular piece of honeycomb. If it snaps, they are eliminated from the contest. \nThe challenge may sound familiar: it featured in an episode of \u201cSquid Game\u201d, a South Korean thriller of 2021. The show remains Netflix\u2019s biggest-ever hit: in the first month after its release subscribers spent around 1.65bn hours watching it, equivalent to 190,000 years. \nIn the fictional game, the penalty for failure was death. In \u201cSquid Game: The Challenge\u201d, a spin-off competition starring real people, \u201cobviously we weren\u2019t going to do that,\u201d says Stephen Lambert, who co-produced the show. (Players are, however, strapped with ink packs that explode when they are knocked out, grimly mimicking a gunshot.) In this version, the stakes may not be life or death, but they are still hefty: 456 people from across the world vie to win nearly $4.6m. \nMr Lambert describes it as \u201cthe largest, most ambitious unscripted show ever produced\u201d. (\u201cUnscripted\u201d refers to game shows, as well as dating and true-crime programmes and some documentaries.) As in the original \u201cSquid Game\u201d drama, the way participants behave during challenges exposes a great deal about their nature. \u201cHow you play is who you are,\u201d the tagline declares. But the show is revealing on another level, too, as it points to several trends in television.\nFirst, a show on this scale is testimony to the pre-eminence of reality tv. The genre is ubiquitous partly because viewers like it: \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d, \u201cJeopardy! Masters\u201d and \u201cSurvivor\u201d were among the most-watched programmes in America last year. Unlike prestige dramas, such programmes rarely require your full attention (see final story). But therein lies reality tv\u2019s appeal. Shows challenge the contestants, but viewers not so much.\nTelevision executives are keen on it, too, because it is cheap to make. An episode of a sumptuous drama can cost millions of dollars, whereas an episode of even a flagship game show can be made for less than $100,000. (\u201cSquid Game: The Challenge\u201d is an outlier, costing more than $1m per instalment.) \nIn the first half of 2023 almost 70% of the shows commissioned globally were unscripted, according to Ampere Analysis, a research firm. In America, reality TV was given a boost by the (now resolved) writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes. During the shutdown, drama producers started developing reality fare instead. This type of entertainment has the benefit of not depending on famous writers, actors or showrunners, says Lucas Green of Banijay, a production company: \u201cThe format is king.\u201d\nSecond, \u201cSquid Game: The Challenge\u201d is evidence of the current zeal for exploiting existing intellectual property. That has long been clear on the big screen, with a never-ending parade of familiar Jedi, superheroes and wizards, but it is becoming more evident on the small screen, too. Amazon recently released \u201c007: Road to a Million\u201d, a competition show yoked to the James Bond franchise, which features contestants travelling around the world acting like secret agents and trying to win a jackpot of \u00a31m ($1.25m). \nIf a show resonates in one country, it will traverse the globe, too. \u201cBig Brother\u201d, featuring strangers enjoying life under surveillance, has been produced in 67 markets. TV executives now scour the world for new IP. \u201cMarried at First Sight\u201d, for example, in which people agree to wed strangers, started in Denmark. As well as being an exporter of popular dramas, South Korea is one of the top incubators of reality tv. \nHits can be reconfigured in different ways. \u201cMasterChef\u201d has nine spin-offs from the original cooking-competition show. No wonder Netflix sought to leverage the immense interest in \u201cSquid Game\u201d: on TikTok, the hashtag has 84.3bn views. \nFinally, the release of \u201cSquid Game: The Challenge\u201d in three batches points to streamers\u2019 changing attitude towards parcelling out content. Entertainment bigwigs are fond of saying that staggered releases recreate the kind of \u201ccollective viewing experience\u201d and water-cooler chatter lost in the digital age. But media companies are also trying to make their on-demand services more profitable. A steady drip of episodes, rather than a sudden deluge, can keep viewers subscribed for longer. Don\u2019t you want to know if contestant 299 can go all the way? \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only
