it is welcome that investment in clean energy has grown exponentially and is now running at almost double the rate of investment in all new fossil fuels. This year solar alone will receive more capital than new oil-and-gas production. As a result of these dramatic shifts, global carbon emissions from energy use may peak next year\nBut even as the arc of global emissions is finally beginning to bend, much more will be required to reach climate justice. First, clean-energy investment must rise from $1.8trn this year to around $4.5trn a year by the early 2030s. And crucially, heavy-emitting industries must begin to make their contributions. These sectors\u2014materials, chemicals, heavy transportation\u2014already generate almost one-third of global emissions. Based on current trajectories those emissions will rise by more than 30% by 2050\u2014putting the world\u2019s climate goals out of reach.\nThe challenges to decarbonising heavy-emitting industries are legion. These parts of the economy are both carbon-intensive and hard to electrify. Getting them to net zero requires building new low-carbon manufacturing facilities, developing sustainable fuels and green-hydrogen supply, and deploying small modular nuclear reactors and carbon-capture and storage capacity. Many of these technologies are nascent and all are uneconomic at small scale. Regulatory barriers are skewing incentives. And given the interconnections between heavy-emitting sectors, slow progress in one sector delays action in another.\nAs a result, many heavy-emitting companies are caught in transition traps. They know what they need to do but struggle to get financing to cut emissions meaningfully. Without clear paths forward, investors are demanding the return of cashflows today rather than encouraging companies to invest them for a low-carbon tomorrow. \nEven financial institutions committed to net zero are facing pressures from stakeholders, including regulators, to measure climate performance by the absolute emissions of assets in their portfolios. This promotes paper decarbonisation\u2014such as a bank that switches lending from a steel company to a software business to reduce its financed emissions\u2014without cutting emissions in the real world.\nWe must tackle these issues head on, not least because heavy-emitting industries are essential to all economies, and will become even more so if developing economies are to continue to urbanise, industrialise and grow. \nTo get these emissions down, we must close three gaps: in data, action and investment.\nToday, companies frequently lack access to the data on emissions they need to assess the carbon exposures within their supply chains, and financial institutions lack the information they need to accurately assess climate opportunity and risk. \nClosing this data gap requires consistent, comprehensive and decision-useful climate disclosure. To that end, the voluntary, private-sector-led Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was launched at the COP in Paris eight years ago. Two years ago in Glasgow, building on the TCFD\u2019s good work, over 40 countries created the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop a standard that can be applied globally and made mandatory. \nThe ISSB\u2019s final standard has now been endorsed by IOSCO, the international body of securities regulators. It is comprehensive, proportionate and, crucially, includes Scope-3 emissions, which count those generated by suppliers and end-users, thereby aligning incentives across value chains. This is vital to decarbonising carbon-intensive sectors. It is time for countries to implement the ISSB\u2019s standards.\nDisclosure defines the problem. Action is needed to fix it. Every country, city, company and financial institution needs a credible, science-aligned net-zero transition plan to fulfil its commitments. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) is helping make these mainstream for the financial sector. Within the next year approximately 250 major financial institutions from around the world will develop transition plans, and policymakers in America, the EU, Britain, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore are recommending others follow.\nGFANZ is also stressing that transition finance must mean much more than only financing clean energy, as critical as that is. It must also include financing heavy-emitting companies that are intent on decarbonising. To that end, GFANZ has developed guidance on a common definition of transition finance that includes \u201cgoing where the emissions are\u201d and backing companies with credible transition plans to get emissions down, and if that is not possible, to fund the managed phase-out of their \u201cstranded\u201d assets: fossil-fuel reserves and infrastructure that are no longer needed as the world pivots to clean energy.\nThese strategies should be complemented by a consistent method to assess the impact of financing. GFANZ members are developing methodologies for expected emissions reductions which financial institutions can use to quantify the \u201cemissions return\u201d of their activities. After all, the climate\u2019s fate depends on what happens on the planet, not on paper.\nGFANZ\u2019s technical consultations are creating the foundation on which standards-setters and regulators can build detailed rules. These can prevent greenwashing and send a clear signal to the private sector about when financing the transition of carbon-intensive companies counts as a sustainable investment.  \nFinally, closing the investment gap in the most heavy-emitting sectors requires new partnerships between producers, their customers, suppliers and governments. These can deepen collaboration on new technologies, increase demand for sustainable products, and identify and dismantle regulatory barriers. When combined with transition finance focused on emissions reductions, this will help companies in the most carbon-intensive sectors make the necessary investments in decarbonisation. \nWhen world leaders, scientists, civil society and businesses gather in Dubai for COP28, the greening of heavy-emitting industries must be a priority. Financial institutions are often criticised for investing too much in polluting industries. The reality is they are not doing enough. Industries such as steel, shipping and cement receive far too little capital to cut their emissions in line with the world\u2019s climate needs. COP28 must break this cycle to get capital to where the emissions are. That\u2019s the only way to bend the emissions curve in time. \u25a0\nMark Carney is the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Co-Chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.", "description": "Helping heavy-emitting sectors to decarbonise is key to reaching net zero, says the UN\u2019s climate envoy", "ogDescription": "Helping heavy-emitting sectors to decarbonise is key to reaching net zero, says the UN\u2019s climate envoy", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231118_BID002.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-11-23T09:47:26Z", "dateModified": "2023-11-23T18:38:46Z", "dateCreated": "2023-11-23T09:47:20Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-11-25T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/6dmdfmj95mu7g9g36se41hvtkuckvps1", "publication": [{"id": "/content/pjdcq7364gqr1pu6n27f4uqgsvcd0i8k", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/krh5a8pjdo4mam4j9v4j8fviljn45n8c", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/nn632rhbtjmakm96opqcpahp9ebm2bhu", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/jih9pm4skkj8gt90sh77hndro5okn269", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r90r2bavfuf35mq32nii2u8gpi02c3ir", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/boa7pimejuvmtc4nr3qdlclqp62hjmhs", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/l22vi257o34veg0dkche6qjb26ffco0o", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0tdsvgd91d60070qgncm91f3v1997jj1", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Mark Carney argues that finance needs to go where the emissions are", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/23/mark-carney-argues-that-finance-needs-to-go-where-the-emissions-are", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/btcblb58rgshbpb6h5p13v8otd7fvifm", "publication": [{"id": "/content/pjdcq7364gqr1pu6n27f4uqgsvcd0i8k", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/krh5a8pjdo4mam4j9v4j8fviljn45n8c", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/nn632rhbtjmakm96opqcpahp9ebm2bhu", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/jih9pm4skkj8gt90sh77hndro5okn269", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r90r2bavfuf35mq32nii2u8gpi02c3ir", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/boa7pimejuvmtc4nr3qdlclqp62hjmhs", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/l22vi257o34veg0dkche6qjb26ffco0o", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0tdsvgd91d60070qgncm91f3v1997jj1", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala says open trade is crucial for decarbonisation", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/21/ngozi-okonjo-iweala-says-open-trade-is-crucial-for-decarbonisation", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
