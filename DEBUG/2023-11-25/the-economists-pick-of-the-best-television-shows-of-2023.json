darkest and most gripping. Barry Berkman, a hitman, reinvented himself as an actor; now he has lost his cover and his freedom. The show\u2014created by and starring Bill Hader, a comedian\u2014interrogates Hollywood\u2019s love of anti-heroes and offers a satisfying ending.\n\u201cThe Bear\u201d\nIn the second season, the run-down sandwich shop that Carmy Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) inherited following his brother\u2019s death has been torn down and reimagined as an haute-cuisine restaurant. Yet \u201cThe Bear\u201d feels true to its beginnings, just as Carmy seeks to retain the team behind the original eatery.\n\u201cBeef\u201d\nAmy Lau (Ali Wong), a woman with lots of money, a perfect home, a stay-at-home husband and an angelic daughter, blows up her life. In this dark and transfixing comedy-drama, a road-rage incident brings her into the orbit of Danny Cho (Steven Yeun), a second-rate contractor. Mutually assured destruction ensues. \n\u201cColin from Accounts\u201d\nThis charming Australian comedy arrived on American and British screens in 2023. It follows Ashley and Gordon, strangers who are brought together by an injured dog. It is written by and starring Harriet Dyer and Patrick Brammall, who are married in real life. The dialogue is superb.\n\u201cThe Crown\u201d\nBack for its sixth and final season, \u201cThe Crown\u201d turns the spotlight on recent history. Viewers already know the dismal ending to the romance between Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) and Dodi Fayed (Khalid Abdalla), but the drama is tightly drawn and mesmerising on screen.\n\u201cDead Ringers\u201d\nA gender-swapped remake of the film of 1988. By turns funny and unsettling, the mini-series revolves around twin sisters and gynaecologists, Elliot and Beverly Mantle (both played by Rachel Weisz), as they open their own birthing centre and conduct ethically dubious research. \n\u201cThe Diplomat\u201d\nKate Wyler (Keri Russell) becomes America\u2019s ambassador to Britain shortly after a hostile power has blown up a British warship in the Persian Gulf. Witty, tense, glossily melodramatic and full of terrific performances, this show is remarkably bingeable. It is the sort of show Netflix was made for.\n\u201cFargo\u201d\nOf all the TV spin-offs and sequels of recent years, \u201cFargo\u201d\u2014based on the black-comedy film of 1996\u2014has been the most surprising. The fifth season, which stars Jon Hamm and Juno Temple, once again enthralls viewers with unique crime capers set in America\u2019s Midwest. \n\u201cThe Gold\u201d\nA dramatisation of the Brink\u2019s-Mat gold-bullion heist in London in 1983. (The haul was worth \u00a326m, about $100m today.) In Neil Forsyth\u2019s hands this becomes a panoramic tale of class, social mobility and police corruption. Hugh Bonneville, Dominic Cooper and Jack Lowden give excellent performances. \n\u201cThe Good Mothers\u201d\nSet in 2010, this show tells the stories of women who dared to defy the \u2019Ndrangheta, the mafia of Calabria. It has none of the insidious glamour that clings to the \u201cGodfather\u201d movies\u2014and to many productions made since. This is noir that is uncompromisingly dark.\n\u201cHappy Valley\u201d\nCatherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a police sergeant, has long been haunted by the crimes of Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton), a rapist who attacked her daughter. Set in a Yorkshire town, this blistering drama tackles themes of injustice, poverty and organised crime.\n\u201cThe Last of Us\u201d\nAdapted from a hit game of 2013, this show finished its debut season as HBO\u2019s biggest hit since \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d. It tells a compelling story of survival in a pandemic-stricken world. Its high point was a love story in the third episode.\n\u201cPoker Face\u201d\nA casino waitress has an uncanny ability to tell when someone is fibbing. When the gangsters who run the casino turn on her, Charlie (Natasha Lyonne) flees and takes her lie-detector skills on the road. Another rollicking murder mystery from Rian Johnson, the writer and director of the \u201cKnives Out\u201d films.\n\u201cSuccession\u201d\nJesse Armstrong, the creator, gives the Roy family a superb send-off. In the final season the back-stabbing and blackmailing reach new heights; funerals and weddings alike are opportunities for vituperation. The series reaches a conclusion that somehow exceeds expectations. \n\u201cWave Makers\u201d\nThis show examines thorny questions of politics and morality in Taiwan. Witty and propulsive, it tells a hopeful story of one person standing up for another\u2014and has inspired real women in the country to speak out about sexual harassment. \u25a0\nFor more on the
