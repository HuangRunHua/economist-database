Two days after Mr S\u00e1nchez was confirmed as prime minister 170,000 people marched in Madrid against the amnesty, the biggest such protest so far. \nVolodymyr Zelensky sacked the head of medical operations for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The president said \u201ca fundamentally new level of medical support for our soldiers\u201d was needed. Reports suggest that some equipment is lacking in the field. The government is also looking at ways to improve troop rotation. Meanwhile, Lloyd Austin, America\u2019s defence secretary, visited Kyiv, where he announced a new $100m package of military aid, the smallest from America so far for Ukraine\u2019s war effort.\nThe German government suspended a vote on the budget amid a crisis resulting from a recent ruling by Germany\u2019s top court, which found that a plan to divert \u20ac60bn ($65bn) in unused covid funds to climate-change programmes was unconstitutional. That legal decision has complicated the government\u2019s spending plans by creating a knock-on effect on its ability to tap money in other special funds. \nLai Ching-te, the presidential candidate of Taiwan\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party, chose Hsiao Bi-khim as his running-mate. Ms Hsiao was Taiwan\u2019s representative in America. Like Mr Lai she favours looser ties with China. Meanwhile, Taiwan\u2019s two main opposition parties, the Nationalist Party (KMT) and Taiwan People\u2019s Party, which both favour closer relations with China, were locked in acrimonious talks over which of their respective candidates should head a joint ticket for January\u2019s election.\n\nNorth Korea claimed it had sent a spy satellite into orbit for the first time, following two failed attempts. South Korea responded by resuming reconnaissance and surveillance operations along the two countries\u2019 frontier, in effect suspending part of an agreement struck with the North in 2018 to reduce tensions.\nThe UN refugee agency called on Pakistan to stop the expulsion of illegal Afghan migrants from the country over the \u201charsh season of winter\u201d. The Pakistani government has ordered illegal Afghan migrants who are not refugees to leave. More than 370,000 have done so, but an unknown number are thought to have gone into hiding.\nThailand\u2019s new government approved an initiative to legalise same-sex marriage. If parliament approves the bill, Thailand will become the third Asian country, following Nepal and Taiwan, to recognise gay marriage.\nVictory for a state slasher\n\nJavier Milei won Argentina\u2019s presidential election run-off, taking 56% of the vote. The self-styled \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d trounced the Peronist candidate in 20 of the country\u2019s 23 provinces. Mr Milei promises to cut red tape and slash public spending. With 40% of Argentines living in poverty, annual inflation expected to be 150% when he takes office next month and interest rates at 133%, Mr Milei says the central bank has enabled only \u201ccrooked\u201d politicians to thrive. \nThe governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, endorsed Donald Trump for president, citing Mr Trump\u2019s pledge to crack down on illegal migration. Mr Trump\u2019s speech at the event was mercifully short, just ten minutes. At other recent campaign stops he has spoken for 75 minutes (Iowa) and two hours (New Hampshire\u2014they don\u2019t call it the Granite State for nothing).", "about": {"public": null, "__typename":

["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2023/11/23/politics", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Israel and Hamas agreed to a temporary truce in order to facilitate the freeing of some hostages who were captured by Hamas during its terrorist attack on Israel on October 7th and taken to Gaza. The deal, brokered by Qatar, will also release 150 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, all of them either women or teenagers. Negotiations over the details delayed the release of the hostages until at least November 24th. The deal will also allow more aid into Gaza.\nIsrael carried out further strikes on southern Lebanon, killing four members of Hamas and five Hizbullah militants. A Lebanese broadcaster said two of its journalists were also killed. Israel has intensified its attacks on Hizbullah targets in response to the Iranian-supported militia stepping up its rocket attacks. \nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels boarded and seized a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship in the Red Sea, claiming it was linked to Israel. The attack by the Iranian-backed group has raised concerns over the security of a vital sea route that carries 40% of Europe\u2019s trade with Asia.\nIsrael recalled its ambassador from South Africa, following an escalation in tensions between the two countries over the war in Gaza. South Africa, along with four other countries, has asked the International Criminal Court to investigate what they allege are Israeli war crimes in Gaza. \nThe effort by Zambia to restructure its debt hit a bump when a deal it had struck with bondholders was rejected by China and France, highlighting the difficulty in getting private and official creditors to agree on debt relief. The setback raises doubts about whether other African countries such as Ghana will be able to resolve their own debt troubles.\nLiberia\u2019s president, George Weah, conceded defeat to Joseph Boakai, his rival in a recent presidential run-off election. Mr Weah\u2019s concession ends worries about post-electoral violence in Liberia\u2019s second democratic transfer of power since 1944, and calls full time on the political career of a man who won fame playing top-flight football in Europe. \nAyes to the right\nThe Dutch election produced a shock result, as the Party for Freedom (PVV) led by Geert Wilders, a veteran far-right politician, won the most seats in parliament. Mr Wilders has pledged to halt a \u201ctsunami of asylum and immigration\u201d to the Netherlands but may find it difficult to form a coalition with the mainstream parties. The conservative party of the outgoing prime minister, Mark Rutte, came third; he is leaving office after 13 years in power.\nBritain\u2019s official figure for net migration in 2022 was revised sharply upwards, from 606,000 to 745,000. For the 12 months ending June 2023 the figure was given as 672,000. The statisticians think the \u201cmore recent estimates indicate a slowing of immigration coupled with increasing emigration.\u201d\nIn Spain Pedro S\u00e1nchez named his coalition cabinet after parliament approved his bid for a new term. The prime minister\u2019s Socialist party came second in an election in July. He has formed a minority government, but only by gaining the backing of Catalan separatists after granting a controversial amnesty to their leaders for holding an illegal referendum. Two days after Mr S\u00e1nchez was confirmed as prime minister 170,000 people marched in Madrid against the amnesty, the biggest such protest so far. \nVolodymyr Zelensky sacked the head of medical operations for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The president said \u201ca fundamentally new level of medical support for our soldiers\u201d was needed. Reports suggest that some equipment is lacking in the field. The government is also looking at ways to improve troop rotation. Meanwhile, Lloyd Austin, America\u2019s defence secretary, visited Kyiv, where he announced a new $100m package of military aid, the smallest from America so far for Ukraine\u2019s war effort.\nThe German government suspended a vote on the budget amid a crisis resulting from a recent ruling by Germany\u2019s top court, which found that a plan to divert \u20ac60bn ($65bn) in unused covid funds to climate-change programmes was unconstitutional. That legal decision has complicated the government\u2019s spending plans by creating a knock-on effect on its ability to tap money in other special funds. \nLai Ching-te, the presidential candidate of Taiwan\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party, chose Hsiao Bi-khim as his running-mate. Ms Hsiao was Taiwan\u2019s representative in America. Like Mr Lai she favours looser ties with China. Meanwhile, Taiwan\u2019s two main opposition parties, the Nationalist Party (KMT) and Taiwan People\u2019s Party, which both favour closer relations with China, were locked in acrimonious talks over which of their respective candidates should head a joint ticket for January\u2019s election.\n\nNorth Korea claimed it had sent a spy satellite into orbit for the first time, following two failed attempts. South Korea responded by resuming reconnaissance and surveillance operations along the two countries\u2019 frontier, in effect suspending part of an agreement struck with the North in 2018 to reduce tensions.\nThe UN refugee agency called on Pakistan to stop the expulsion of illegal Afghan migrants from the country over the \u201charsh season of winter\u201d. The Pakistani government has ordered illegal Afghan migrants who are not refugees to leave. More than 370,000 have done so, but an unknown number are thought to have gone into hiding.\nThailand\u2019s new government approved an initiative to legalise same-sex marriage. If parliament approves the bill, Thailand will become the third Asian country, following Nepal and Taiwan, to recognise gay marriage.\nVictory for a state slasher\n\nJavier Milei won Argentina\u2019s presidential election run-off, taking 56% of the vote. The self-styled \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d trounced the Peronist candidate in 20 of the country\u2019s 23 provinces. Mr Milei promises to cut red tape and slash public spending. With 40% of Argentines living in poverty, annual inflation expected to be 150% when he takes office next month and interest rates at 133%, Mr Milei says the central bank has enabled only \u201ccrooked\u201d politicians to thrive. \nThe governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, endorsed Donald Trump for president, citing Mr Trump\u2019s pledge to crack down on illegal migration. Mr Trump\u2019s speech at the event was mercifully short, just ten minutes. At other recent campaign stops he has spoken for 75 minutes (Iowa) and two hours (New Hampshire\u2014they don\u2019t call it the Granite State for nothing).", "description": "", "ogDescription": "",
