"url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/23/univision-americas-spanish-news-giant-reaches-out-to-donald-trump", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "The last time Donald Trump took questions on camera from Univision, America\u2019s biggest Spanish-language television network, the reporter ended up being bundled out of the room by Mr Trump\u2019s security. \u201cGo back to Univision!\u201d jeered Mr Trump, as Jorge Ramos, the channel\u2019s star anchor, refused to stop asking questions at a press conference in 2015. Univision, then owned by a big Democratic Party donor, was seen as hostile by many Republicans.\nNo longer. On November 9th Mr Trump sat down with Univision for an hour-long, primetime interview with notably soft questions. A rebuttal interview with the Democrats was cancelled. Democratic ads bought to fill breaks in the broadcast were also canned. Mr Trump, who once described Mexican immigrants as rapists, called Latinos \u201cincredible people\u201d. \u201cAll you have to do is look at the owners of Univision,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re unbelievable, entrepreneurial people. And they like me.\u201d\nThat remark raised eyebrows. Last year Univision merged with part of Televisa, Mexico\u2019s leading broadcaster, which has historically maintained cosy relations with politicians. In the 20th century it was a \u201csoldier\u201d of Mexico\u2019s ruling party, in the words of its then boss. It has since warmed to Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico\u2019s left-wing president. Televisa executives were present at the interview with Mr Trump, along with Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, who is friendly with Televisa\u2019s top brass and helped to arrange the interview, according to the Washington Post. \nForeign ownership of American TV stations is limited by law, but regulators granted Univision an exception. Its Mexican partners now seem to be shaping the newsroom. A few days after the Trump interview the station abruptly parted company with Le\u00f3n Krauze, an anchor who had been singled out for criticism by Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador for his coverage of a recent hurricane in Acapulco. On November 17th Univision\u2019s American boss, Wade Davis, assured staff that \u201cwe hold Univision News to the highest standards of journalism\u201d.\nThe behind-camera drama could be consequential. Half of America\u2019s 60m Latinos get their news from Univision\u2014as many as tune in to Fox News\u2014according to polling by the Pew Research Centre. They trust it more than any network bar CNN, Pew finds. And as Latinos spread into swing states, politicians are eager to court them. Mr Trump, who won about 28% of the Latino vote in 2016, won 38% in 2020 and is polling strongly this year.\nReaching them depends less on Spanish-language media than in the past. Two-thirds of America\u2019s Latinos were born in America, up from 60% at the turn of the century, and a quarter of Hispanics now say they can speak Spanish only a little. This is reflected in their media habits. Since 2008 they have been more likely to consume news in English than Spanish, finds Pew. Univision\u2019s evening news has lost 40% of its audience in the past six years, according to Comscore, a data company (during the same period, English-language rivals saw viewership rise).\nMainstream media are catering more to Latinos, too. Newspapers such as the New York Times have Spanish-language editions and podcasts. And Latin culture is in demand from all audiences. Last month Bad Bunny, a Puerto Rican singer, presented \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d partly in Spanish (with subtitles reading: \u201cSPEAKING A SEXIER LANGUAGE\u201d). Hispanic staff these days make up nearly a tenth of America\u2019s TV news workforce, double the share in 1995. \nAt the margins, however, Spanish-language media can still play a decisive role. Univision is particularly influential in swing states where the Hispanic population is insufficient to support more than one Spanish station, points out Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist. And though its audience is ageing, older viewers are reliable voters. \u201cThere are little old Mexican ladies every night, who watch [Jorge Ramos on Univision] and think of him as the voice of God,\u201d says Mr Rocha. Mr Ramos began his career with Televisa in Mexico, but left for America after it censored his stories. So far, regarding the Trump interview, the voice of God has yet to speak.\u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter examining the state of
