OpenAI was founded as a non-profit, in order to push the frontiers of AI to a point where computers can out-think people, yet without sacrificing human pre-eminence. But it also needed money. For that it established a for-profit subsidiary that offered investors capped rewards but no say in the running of the company. Mr Altman, who owns no shares in OpenAI, has defended the model. In March he told one interviewer that putting such technologies into the hands of a company that sought to create unlimited value left him \u201ca little afraid\u201d. \nAnd yet he also appears to chafe against its constraints. As he did at YC, he has pursued side projects, including seeking investors to make generative-AI devices and semiconductors, which could potentially be hugely lucrative. The old board is being replaced by a new one that may turn out to be less wedded to OpenAI\u2019s safety-above-all-else charter. The incoming chairman, Bret Taylor, used to run Salesforce, a software giant. On his watch the startup could come to resemble a more conventional, fast-scaling tech company. Mr Altman will probably be happy with that, too.\nMercury rising  \nIf that happens, OpenAI may become an even hotter ticket. With the latest version of its AI model, GPT-5, and other products on the way, it is ahead of the pack. Mr Altman has a unique knack for raising money and recruiting talented individuals, and his task would be all the easier with a more normal corporate structure. But his ambiguities, especially over where to strike the balance between speed and safety, are a lesson. Though Mr Altman has been welcomed into the world\u2019s corridors of power to provide guidance on AI regulation, his own convictions are still not set in stone. That is all the more reason for governments to set the tone on AI safety, not mercurial tech visionaries. \u25a0\nRead more from Schumpeter, our columnist on global business:\nHow to think about the Google anti-monopoly trial (Nov 15th)\nThe Bob Iger v Nelson Peltz rematch (Nov 9th)\nChinese apps are a mixed blessing for American big tech (Nov 2nd)\nAlso: If you want to write directly to Schumpeter, email him at schumpeter@economist.com.

"Call it the \u201cBurning Man\u201d theory of tech. Every so often, the hopes and dreams of a technological visionary are almost torched by those who surround them. In 1985 Steve Jobs was fired from Apple, the company he fathered, and did not return for 11 years. In 2000 Elon Musk\u2019s co-founders ousted him as CEO of X.com, the firm that went on to become PayPal, a digital-payments platform. In 2008 Jack Dorsey\u2019s fellow creators of Twitter ended his short reign as chief executive of the social-media app. On November 17th Sam Altman looked like he would become the Bay Area\u2019s next burnt effigy, ousted from OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence (AI) firm he co-founded in 2015, by a board that accused him of lacking candour. But on November 21st, after four days in which he, his employees and OpenAI\u2019s investors, such as Microsoft, wrangled feverishly for his reinstatement, he was back in control of the firm. \u201cWow it even took Jesus three days,\u201d one wag tweeted in the midst of the drama. Instead of Mr Altman, three of the four board members who gave him the boot are toast.\nIt is not the first time in his 38 years on Earth that Mr Altman has been at the centre of such an imbroglio. He is a man of such supreme self-confidence that people tend to treat him as either genius or opportunist\u2014the latter usually in private. Like Jobs, he has a messianic ability to inspire people, even if he doesn\u2019t have the iPhone creator\u2019s God-like eye for design. Like Mr Musk, he has ironclad faith in his vision for the future, even if he lacks the Tesla boss\u2019s legendary engineering skills. Like Mr Dorsey, he has shipped a product, ChatGPT, that has become a worldwide topic of conversation\u2014and consternation. \nYet along the way he has irked people. This started at Y Combinator (YC), a hothouse for entrepreneurs, which he led from 2014 until he was pushed out in 2019 for scaling it up too fast and getting distracted by side hustles such as OpenAI. At OpenAI, he fell out with Mr Musk, another co-founder, and some influential AI researchers who left in a huff. The latest evidence comes from the four board members who clumsily sought to fire him. The specific reasons for their decision remain unclear. But it would not be a surprise if Mr Altman\u2019s unbridled ambition played a role.\nIf there is one constant in Mr Altman\u2019s life, it is a missionary zeal that even by Silicon Valley standards is striking. Some entrepreneurs are motivated by fame and fortune. His goal appears to be techno-omnipotence. Paul Graham, co-founder of YC, said of Mr Altman, then still in his early 20s: \u201cYou could parachute him into an island full of cannibals and come back in five years and he\u2019d be the king.\u201d \nForget the island. The world is now his domain. In 2021 he penned a Utopian manifesto called \u201cMoore\u2019s Law for Everything\u201d, predicting that the AI revolution (which he was leading) would shower benefits on Earth\u2014creating phenomenal wealth, changing the nature of work, reducing poverty. He is an ardent proponent of nuclear fusion, arguing that coupled with ChatGPT-like \u201cgenerative\u201d AI, falling costs of knowledge and energy will create a \u201cbeautiful exponential curve\u201d. This is heady stuff, all the more so given the need to strike a careful balance between speed and safety when rolling out such world-changing technologies. Where Mr Altman sits on that spectrum is hard to gauge.\nMr Altman is a man of contradictions. In 2016, when he still led YC, Peter Thiel, a billionaire venture capitalist, described him to the New Yorker as \u201cnot particularly religious but\u2026culturally very Jewish\u2014an optimist yet a survivalist\u201d (back then Mr Altman had a bolthole in Big Sur, stocked with guns and gold, in preparation for rogue AIs, pandemics and other disasters). As for his enduring optimism, it rang out clearly during an interview he recorded just two days before OpenAI\u2019s boardroom coup, which he did not see coming. \u201cWhat differentiates me [from] most of the AI companies is I think AI is good,\u201d he told \u201cHard Fork\u201d, a podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t secretly hate what I do all day. I think it\u2019s going to be awesome.\u201d\nHe has sought to have it both ways when it comes to OpenAI\u2019s governance, too. Mr Altman devised the wacky corporate structure at the heart of the latest drama. OpenAI was founded as a non-profit, in order to push the frontiers of AI to a point where computers can out-think people, yet without sacrificing human pre-eminence. But it also needed money. For that it established a for-profit subsidiary that offered investors capped rewards but no say in the running of the company. Mr Altman, who owns no shares in OpenAI, has defended the model. In March he told one interviewer that putting such technologies into the hands of a company that sought to create unlimited value left him \u201ca little afraid\u201d. \nAnd yet he also appears to chafe against its constraints. As he did at YC, he has pursued side projects, including seeking investors to make generative-AI devices and semiconductors, which could potentially be hugely lucrative. The old board is being replaced by a new one that may turn out to be less wedded to OpenAI\u2019s safety-above-all-else charter. The incoming chairman, Bret Taylor, used to run Salesforce, a software giant. On his watch the startup could come to resemble a more conventional, fast-scaling tech company. Mr Altman will probably be happy with that, too.\nMercury rising  \nIf that happens, OpenAI may become an even hotter ticket. With the latest version of its AI model, GPT-5, and other products on the way, it is ahead of the pack. Mr Altman has a unique knack for raising money and recruiting talented individuals, and his task would be all the easier with a more normal corporate structure. But his ambiguities, especially over where to strike the balance between speed and safety, are a lesson. Though Mr Altman has been welcomed into the world\u2019s corridors of power to provide guidance on AI regulation, his own convictions are still not set in stone. That is all the more reason for governments to set the tone on AI safety, not mercurial tech visionaries. \u25a0\nRead more from Schumpeter, our columnist on global business:\nHow to think about the Google anti-monopoly trial (Nov 15th)\nThe Bob Iger v Nelson Peltz rematch (Nov 9th)\nChinese apps are a mixed blessing for American big tech (Nov 2nd)\nAlso: If you want to write directly to Schumpeter, email him at schumpeter@economist.com.
