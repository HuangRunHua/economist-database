Israel tripled its territory, capturing the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the Sinai peninsula. Israel has since moved to build Jewish settlements on some of the land occupied during the war.\nSuez crisis\nIn October 1956 Israel invaded Egypt, capturing the Sinai peninsula and the Gaza Strip. The conflict was planned in collusion with Britain and France in order to allow them to regain control of the Suez Canal which they had run until Egypt\u2019s president, Gamal Abdul Nasser, nationalised it in July 1956. America was outraged and pushed Britain to abort the mission. In December 1956 the Israelis withdrew from Sinai and in March 1957 they withdrew from Gaza.\nSykes-Picot Agreement \nDuring the first world war Sir Mark Sykes, a British diplomat, and Fran\u00e7ois Georges-Picot, a French one, were appointed to secretly divvy up the lands of the Ottoman empire. The Arab provinces were to be split up among European powers. Given its significance in Christianity, Islam and Judaism, Palestine was envisioned as an international territory.\nTel Aviv \nIsrael\u2019s largest city and financial capital. Of the 96 embassies in Israel, 91 are located in Tel Aviv (the other five, including the American embassy, are in Jerusalem).\nTransjordan\nAn Arab kingdom under Hashemite rule, created by Britain in 1921 after the San Remo Conference. Now Jordan.\nTunnels \nFirst built for smuggling, tunnels under Gaza are used by Hamas fighters to attack Israel and to hide from Israeli fire. After the October 7th attacks the Israel Defence Forces unleashed air strikes to damage the tunnels.\nTwo-state solution\nA proposed peace plan to end the Isreli-Palestinian conflict that is widely supported internationally. A Palestinian state would be formed in Gaza and the West Bank; Israel would swap chunks of its territory for portions with large settlements in the West Bank. Jerusalem would be shared, with some sort of joint control over the old city. \nUNRWA \nThe UN\u2019s Relief and Works Agency, which looks after the welfare of 5.9m registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.\nWar of Independence\nIsrael\u2019s name for the war of 1947-48. On May 14th 1948 Jewish leaders established the state of Israel. On May 15th a coalition of Arab neighbours invaded. At the end of the war Israel increased its territory to include land the UN had intended for an Arab state, as well as West Jerusalem. Transjordan held the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Egypt held the Gaza Strip. The war was followed by the mass displacement of Palestinian Arabs, known in Arabic as the Nakba.\nWest Bank \nIsraeli-occupied territory run in part by the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians view it as the core of their would-be state. Right-wing and religious Israelis regard it as their ancestral territory, with many biblical sites, and are pushing for Israel to annex it in part or entirely. Home to increasing numbers of Israeli settlers.\nYom Kippur war \nIn October 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria launched an attack in Sinai and the Golan Heights. The war lasted three weeks and ended with a ceasefire secured by the UN.\nZionism \nA movement founded by Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian Jew, with the aim of creating a Jewish homeland. In the 1920s the movement was dominated by socialists, who went on to establish the state of Israel on socialist principles. In more recent years religious Zionism, an offshoot, which regards Zionism as a fundamental component of Orthodox Judaism, has become a powerful force. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": null, "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "The Economist explains"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "contentIdentity": {"articleType": null, "__typename": "ContentIdentity"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "publication": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "type": ["Blog"], "headline": "The Economist explains", "description": "Subjects topical and timeless, profound and peculiar, explained with The Economist's trademark clarity and brevity", "subheadline": "Explaining the world, daily", "datePublished": "2014-02-06T08:58:31Z", "datePublishedString": "Feb 6th 2014", "id": "/content/md2otnsr4fvud5kbahk8m3ktoif2fs2i", "tegID": "md2otnsr4fvud5kbahk8m3ktoif2fs2i", "image": {"cover": null, "main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/explains.png", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1985, "height": 1136}, "squareCover": null, "__typename": "Media"}, "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/20/the-a-to-z-of-the-arab-israeli-conflict", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/7pk49hqel6fvq4lksc609ehm6glno6f2", "headline": "The A to Z of the Arab-Israeli conflict", "subheadline": "The Economist explains", "description": "From \u201cAbraham accords\u201d to \u201cZionism\u201d", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231125_OPD001.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}, "audio": {"main": null, "__typename": "Media"}, "contentIdentity": {"mediaType": null, "__typename": "ContentIdentity"}, "articleSection": {"internal": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "publication": [{"headline": "The Economist explains", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "md2otnsr4fvud5kbahk8m3ktoif2fs2i"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 25TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-11-25", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "pjdcq7364gqr1pu6n27f4uqgsvcd0i8k"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 25TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/eu/printedition/2023-11-25", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "krh5a8pjdo4mam4j9v4j8fviljn45n8c"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 25TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/ap/printedition/2023-11-25", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "nn632rhbtjmakm96opqcpahp9ebm2bhu"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 25TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/la/printedition/2023-11-25", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "jih9pm4skkj8gt90sh77hndro5okn269"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 25TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/me/printedition/2023-11-25", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "r90r2bavfuf35mq32nii2u8gpi02c3ir"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 25TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/uk/printedition/2023-11-25", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "boa7pimejuvmtc4nr3qdlclqp62hjmhs"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 25TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/na/printedition/2023-11-25", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "l22vi257o34veg0dkche6qjb26ffco0o"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 25TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/a/printedition/2023-11-25", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "0tdsvgd91d60070qgncm91f3v1997jj1"}], "channel": {"tegID": "j53t6hsedat4l7rkbb1le98u73262sh5", "__typename": "Content"}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/11/18/was-israels-attack-on-al-shifa-hospital-justified", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/4purc8n4rpu73shp5a2u5fo6mm6njd9l", "headline": "Was Israel\u2019s attack on al-Shifa hospital justified?", "subheadline": "The Economist explains", "description": "Israel has so far offered little evidence that it was.
