Across most of one full floor of a fancy new office building, the usual desks and cubicles have been replaced by a laboratory. Around three dozen scientists use it to design prototypes of packets of chemicals that help keep fruit and vegetables fresh by controlling the creation of ethylene, a gas that induces ripening. On another floor, commercial staff sell the chemicals to clients all over the world. Hazel, founded in 2015 by five students at Northwestern University, in the northern suburbs, has grown in the past few years to over 100 employees. In 2021 it raised $70m in venture financing, and it now works in a dozen countries.\nFew Chicagoans have heard of Hazel\u2014even the city\u2019s bigwigs are barely aware of it. And yet the West Loop district, where Fulton Market is, is bustling with new firms like this, quietly doing lucrative things. The workers they are hiring are filling up not only offices but also dozens of new apartment buildings. And more are coming. Across the street from Hazel\u2019s offices, cranes are already working on turning what is currently a patch of wasteland into yet another shiny tower of glass and steel. Patrick Flynn, the firm\u2019s co-founder, says even he is bemused by the pace of change around him. When he was a teenager in Chicago in the late 1990s, this far west of the Loop was an area you would be careful walking in at night at weekends, he says. Nowadays, the neighbourhood is so trendy it even has a branch of Soho House, an expensive London members\u2019 club that reliably opens up anywhere in the world seen as hip by management consultants.\nAnd yet this story is not the one you hear in the city\u2019s boardrooms. Instead, many people in Chicago think that the city is entering a spiral of decline. \u201cThere is a general sense out there that our city is in crisis,\u201d said Chris Kempczinski, the CEO of McDonald\u2019s, which is based in the city, in September. In June, Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of Citadel, a hedge fund, moved himself, his money and many of his staff out of the city to Miami. Less than  a year before, he had claimed that \u201cChicago is like Afghanistan on a good day.\u201d In the past year, Boeing and Caterpillar have also moved their headquarters in the Chicago region out\u2014to the Washington, DC, area and to Texas, respectively. Even the Chicago Bears, the city\u2019s NFL team, are proposing to leave their home at Soldier Field, on the lakefront, to move to the suburbs. As the city prepares for its mayoral and city council elections in February, this sense of doom is infectious. But is it justified? \nAccording to Rob Paral, a demographer at the University of Illinois, Chicago has long had \u201cthis neurotic worry about whether it is going to become another rustbelt city\u201d. But the growth in the West Loop shows how overdone this is. Between the two censuses of 2010 and 2020, an area Mr Paral calls the \u201cSuper Loop\u201d, taking in the traditional city centre as well as the neighbourhoods immediately around it, grew in population by 18%. Even more remarkably, the number of housing units grew by 23%. Roughly one in eight Chicagoans now live around the city centre, up from an almost negligible number just a generation ago. According to data from the state of Illinois, the number of jobs in a roughly analogous \u201couter business ring\u201d grew by 33% from 2011 to 2020 (though it then fell back sharply in 2021 because of covid). \n  World-class weather\n\nLook at \u201cChicagoland\u201d as a whole\u2014not only the city\u2019s 2.7m people, but also the other 6m or so in its suburbs\u2014and it is true that the city\u2019s performance looks far more middling. As a share of America\u2019s total GDP, the region declined from 4.3% to 3.7% between 2001 and 2020. Coastal cities such as New York, San Francisco and Seattle have all grown much faster, as have southern sunbelt cities like Austin and Houston, which is on course to overtake Chicago\u2019s population within the next decade. Troublingly, it has even lagged behind a few other midwestern cities, such as Columbus, Ohio, which is now home to 900,000 people, and Indianapolis, Indiana, which is home to 800,000. That is worrying for the region. But when the city proper is growing fast, the chance of it entering a death spiral\u2014as residents leave and taxes cannot cover services, causing more to leave\u2014is low. In fact, the city of Chicago is poaching residents and businesses back from the suburbs. Between the two censuses, the state of Illinois as a whole lost population; Chicago gained it.\nA similar dynamic applies to the biggest obsession of politicians and the business world: crime. In absolute terms, Chicago has more murders than any other American city\u2014over 800 in 2021 and 723 in 2022. Other high-profile violent crimes, in particular car-jacking, have soared since the pandemic, generating ugly headlines. Yet crime has soared all over America, and not much more in Chicago than elsewhere. Compared with New York or Los Angeles, Chicago is an appallingly violent place. But the murder rate is still lower than in many other large cities, such as Washington, DC, Indianapolis and Atlanta. Crime ought to concern Chicago\u2019s leaders: the human damage done is enormous. But it is harder to argue that it is a threat to the core economic basis of the city. The violence is concentrated in a few of the poorest neighbourhoods, mostly on the South Side and West Side of the city, where a legacy of segregation has left neighbourhoods abandoned. There, it is getting worse. Murder rates in the city\u2019s wealthier neighbourhoods, including downtown, are hardly higher than elsewhere in America. \nDon\u2019t say provincial \nWhat Chicago has, says Aaron Renn of the Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think-tank, is an identity crisis. \u201cChicago feels like it deserves to be considered one of the big important global cities,\u201d he says. But whereas its culture, museums, restaurants and much else can be considered truly global, its economy is not, quite. Where cities on the coasts have specialised in finance or tech, Chicago is a diversified economy. It has tech: Google is busy renovating a modernist office block, the Thompson Centre, downtown to house over 2,000 workers. It has finance: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange remains a hub of derivatives and commodities trading. It even still has a relatively large manufacturing industry. But no sector dominates, and the city has few top-tier firms headquartered there. Instead of being a truly \u201cglobal city\u201d, its economy tends to reflect America\u2019s at large. Its greatest asset, Mr Renn says, is affordability\u2014which means that upper-middle-class professionals can have the sort of affluent urban lifestyles scarcely possible in New York or San Francisco.\nAnd according to Pete Saunders, an urban planner and commentator, that failure to escape its true Americanness is the source of much of the city\u2019s angst. \u201cChicago has tried to climb the heights that most of the coastal cities have but we haven\u2019t quite gotten there, and there\u2019s a frustration,\u201d he says. Half of the city is doing exceptionally well, he says, but the other half is struggling\u2014like cities across the rustbelt\u2014with a legacy of deindustrialisation, segregation and impoverished local government. Whereas a neighbourhood like River North added over 20% to its population in the decade to 2020, Englewood, on the far South Side, lost 20%, most of them black residents. Even though the city overall may not be in a death spiral, in such places it can feel as if it is. In the decade to 2020, Chicago lost 85,000 black residents, more than any other big city except  Detroit. \nIn time, simple mathematics suggests that Chicago\u2019s population could grow rather fast. Put brutally, the poorest neighbourhoods such as Englewood do not have many people left to lose. Deindustrialisation can continue only until there is no industry left to lose. By contrast, the growing parts of the city can continue to grow\u2014with far fewer of the NIMBYish constraints that are strangling coastal cities, and without the costs of sprawl now afflicting places like Austin, Texas. As the West Loop shows, when demand is there, there is no shortage of land to build fancy new condos or office blocks. \u201cWe have room to grow,\u201d says Samir Mayekar, the city\u2019s deputy mayor, who argues that even the proliferation of derelict lots ought to be seen as an opportunity, because it means there is always space to build. That is before even accounting for unknowable benefits as climate change worsens, such as access to fresh water, a stable (if miserably cold in winter) climate, and a strong electricity grid, which could make Chicago more attractive in the future than it has been.\nThe challenge for Chicago is focusing on that longer-run vision, and ensuring that the wealth being created in the city can jump across its old racial barriers to benefit everyone living there. It is an aim that the city\u2019s civic leaders, too focused on immediate difficulties, typically fail to articulate. The election in February seems sure to almost entirely skip discussion of a long-term vision, and whoever wins will find the same political constraints that every Chicago mayor has. But in a way that hardly makes the place unique. In fact, it represents the challenge facing all America, in microcosm.\u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state
