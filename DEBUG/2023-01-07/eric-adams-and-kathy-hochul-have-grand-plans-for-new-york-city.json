If only. As of mid-September only half of Manhattan office workers actually go to work in Manhattan. Spending at restaurants and bars in the city\u2019s big business districts is 23% below its pre-pandemic levels. As fewer commuters ride trains, the subway system is cutting its service on Mondays and Fridays. It looks unlikely that New York will return to its old version of normal. The question now is how the city might advance to a better one. \nThat is the goal set by Eric Adams, New York\u2019s Democratic mayor, and Kathy Hochul, the state\u2019s Democratic governor. Last month a panel convened by the mayor and governor presented a plan to transform New York City, with 40 initiatives to reinvent three broad areas: business districts, commuting and housing, and to do all this with equity as well growth in mind. Local governments specialise in reports on the future, but this one stands out. \nThat is in part because Mr Adams and Ms Hochul are collaborating\u2014a seemingly small feat  but an unusual one in New York, where prior governors and mayors specialised in enmity. Business leaders also seem to back it; many top executives sat on the panel. And because the report\u2019s recommendations are particularly bold. \nThat is especially evident in the proposals for the city\u2019s business districts. Lots of cities are struggling with empty offices as people continue to work at least partly from home. In Manhattan the office vacancy rate is at record high. Many shops, from retailers to dry-cleaners, and restaurants, which rely on office workers for custom, are closed or are struggling.\nRethinking and reimagining business districts as vibrant 24/7 places, with more of a mix of residential and office space, is a key part of the stabilising plan. Among the panel\u2019s recommendations is to create tax incentives to encourage landlords to convert offices into residential spaces or to update office space. Less restrictive zoning laws will be needed. Some of the recommendations require legislative changes, which is always complicated.\nIt will be difficult if not unfeasible to convert many of the larger office buildings into residential use. Nicole Gelinas of the Manhattan Institute, a think-tank, doubts that there will be much converting.  \u201cApartments without windows or apartments without kitchens? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d she says. Dylan Burzinski of Green Street, an analytics firm, says only about 20m square feet (1.8m square metres) can be converted to residential space, which is not a lot compared with Manhattan\u2019s 420m square feet office market. A good chunk of the city\u2019s office buildings are functionally obsolete and energy inefficient. Tear downs will be necessary\u2014the average building is 75 years old.\nConversion probably would not generate the same tax revenues for the city either. Manhattan\u2019s business districts generate 59% of citywide office and retail-property tax revenue.  A decrease could eventually affect city services. The future looks bleak. A recent paper co-authored by Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, \u201cWork from Home and the Office Real Estate Apocalypse\u201d, estimates that office valuations will be 39% below 2019 values by 2029. Many companies, such as Meta, are downsizing office space. \nReinvention is part of New York\u2019s DNA. Its bustling port gave way to humming factories, which gave way to skyscrapers full of office workers. The panel\u2019s co-chair, Dan Doctoroff, when working for former mayor Michael Bloomberg, used the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan after the 2001 attacks as a catalyst to rethink and rezone much of the city. He says \u201cthe key thing is execution. We gotta hold elected officials responsible, accountable.\u201d Happily, he says, Mr Adams and Ms Hochul are fully behind the plan. With recession looming and companies such as Goldman Sachs announcing layoffs uncertainty abounds. Ironically, says Kathryn Wylde of the Partnership for New York City, this is starting to drive people back to the office.  \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly
