from China\u2019s highest level of economic policymaking. He must have many regrets, not least the battering of his country\u2019s economy by a now-abandoned struggle to crush covid-19, and by the disease\u2019s recent rapid spread. But Mr Liu grinned with obvious pride as he recalled how members of the global elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos had responded to his delegation\u2019s upbeat remarks there a few days ago. \u201cAll kinds of people said, \u2018Hey, China is back again!\u2019\u201d he told a television reporter.  \nMr Liu, who is one of China\u2019s four deputy prime ministers and a trusted adviser of China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, was being modest. It was he, not others in his entourage, who had stolen the show. Among the assembled business titans his speech on January 17th struck a welcome note given the fragile state of the world economy. \u201cIf we work hard enough,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Chinese economy will see a significant improvement in 2023.\u201d He pledged \u201cmore focus\u201d on supporting private business\u2014which has been deeply disturbed by Mr Xi\u2019s campaign of the past two years to tighten controls over technology firms and his stepped-up use of Marxist-sounding language. To those worried about China\u2019s many barriers to foreign firms, Mr Liu had soothing words: \u201cChina\u2019s national reality dictates that opening up to the world is a must, not an expediency. We must open up wider and make it work better.\u201d \nThere was nothing strikingly new in Mr Liu\u2019s remarks. But their emollient tone fuelled speculation among observers that, as well as ditching the \u201czero-covid\u201d policy, Mr Xi has decided to tone down some of the rhetoric that has caused jitters among businesspeople at home and abroad, ease pressure on entrepreneurs and prevent further deterioration of his country\u2019s badly strained ties with the West. China\u2019s state-controlled media have encouraged such thinking. After attending the forum Mr Liu met America\u2019s treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, in Zurich for their first face-to-face encounter since she took up her post two years ago. One Chinese news outlet called it \u201canother sign of ice-breaking between the world\u2019s two largest economies\u201d. \nIt may well be that China sees a need to adjust its tactics on a range of matters, both economic and diplomatic. At 3%, annual GDP growth last year was the second-slowest since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. America\u2019s efforts to curb the flow of cutting-edge technology to China are frustrating Mr Xi\u2019s ambitions for supremacy in the tech sector. As geopolitical tensions have grown, and covid has exposed the vulnerability of China-linked supply chains, Western firms have become much more nervous about relying on the country as the source of every widget. China\u2019s cosy ties with Russia, and refusal to censure its invasion of Ukraine, have poisoned China\u2019s relationship with much of Europe, a region it has long been trying to win over in an attempt to weaken America\u2019s alliances. \nChina likes to use Davos as a place for buttering up foreigners. In 2017, nearly five years after he took power and began spreading ripples of unease across the West, Mr Xi himself turned up. He was the first supreme leader of China to attend the forum. The audience heard a portrayal of the country as a champion of globalisation and leader of efforts to combat climate change. America\u2019s president-elect, Donald Trump, appeared determined to steer in the opposite direction. That made it all the easier for Mr Xi to score points. \nBut China\u2019s recent actions also mark a shift. One was Mr Xi\u2019s decision to meet his American counterpart, Joe Biden, on the margins of a G20 summit in Bali in November. Since August, China had been barely on talking terms with America because of a visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives (China claims the island and abhors official contacts with it by foreigners). Antony Blinken, America\u2019s secretary of state, is expected to visit Beijing in February, the State Department says. It would be the first such trip by America\u2019s most senior diplomat since 2018. Also next month films by Marvel Studios, a Hollywood company, will be shown in Chinese cinemas, ending China\u2019s unexplained four-year ban. \nChina is putting out feelers to other Western countries, too. While in Bali, Mr Xi also met Australia\u2019s prime minister, Anthony Albanese. It was the first one-on-one encounter between the two countries at that level since 2016\u2014Australia having offended China on numerous fronts, including by calling for an independent inquiry into covid\u2019s origins. China appears to have eased a two-year ban on imports of Australian coal. And Mr Xi has stepped up the tempo of diplomacy with Europe. In November he hosted a visit by Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz. President Emmanuel Macron of France is expected to follow early this year. \nSoothing the private sector \nOn the economy, the tone is also changing. The official account of the Communist Party\u2019s annual closed-door gathering in December to discuss economic policy, the Central Economic Work Conference, contained far less of Mr Xi\u2019s ideological language and no railing against \u201cdisorderly expansion of capital\u201d, which fintech firms had previously been accused of perpetrating. It said China should \u201cvigorously develop\u201d the digital economy. The Asia Society Policy Institute, a think-tank in New York, said the wording was arguably Mr Xi\u2019s \u201cmost affirmative and authoritative statement on the political and ideological legitimacy of the private sector\u201d since he came to power. \nIn recent weeks, the government has also retreated from its two-year-long attempt to curb property-market mayhem by imposing tight limits on borrowing by developers. The sector still badly needs an overhaul, but businesspeople are relieved by the return to a more cautious approach. The campaign had been hammering sales.  \nBut it would be wrong to conclude that Mr Xi himself has changed, or that he is politically weaker. China\u2019s chaotic exit from zero-covid\u2014a policy with which he was closely linked\u2014may have dented his credibility among China\u2019s elite and an unknowable number of regular folk who have lost relatives to the virus, and now see their deaths covered up. But the country\u2019s political machinery hums along as it did in the build-up to a party congress in October, at which Mr Xi secured an unprecedented third five-year term as general secretary and a Politburo packed with loyalists. \nAround the country, officials still pepper speeches with fawning references to Mr Xi and his leadership. China is still flexing its muscle around Taiwan (see next story). Even as they try to mend fences with Western countries, China\u2019s envoys continue to use the sharp language about the West that has become a hallmark of diplomacy under Mr Xi. In Davos, Mr Liu may have said what his audience wanted to hear about China\u2019s economy. But his call for an end to \u201ccold-war\u201d thinking was a veiled snipe at America. In China\u2019s view, America is the chief purveyor of it. He twice mentioned Mr Xi\u2019s idea of a \u201ccommunity with a shared future for mankind\u201d. This means, in effect, a new world order in which criticism of China is taboo. \nMr Xi will try to use two big political events this year to boost public and business confidence in the economy and in his support for non-state firms. The first is the annual session of the country\u2019s parliament, which is due to be held in March. The outgoing prime minister, Li Keqiang, will deliver the main report. It is likely to echo the language of December\u2019s work conference. In the autumn the party\u2019s 376-member Central Committee will meet. By tradition, at this stage of China\u2019s political cycle, it should focus on the economy. Expect reform to be the buzzword. \nBut cynicism will abound, too. A year after he took power Mr Xi presided over a similar meeting of the Central Committee. Its vaguely worded communiqu\u00e9 gushed with talk of reform that soon began to sound empty as he focused on boosting party control over business, and beefing up state-owned firms in particular. \nFour years later, Mr Xi had his turn as Davos man. But subsequent years of his rule saw ever more draconian clampdowns at home\u2014not least in Xinjiang and Hong Kong\u2014a downward spiral in relations with the West and growing despondency among private entrepreneurs and foreign investors alike. \u201cThere\u2019s just a certain amount of wishful thinking on some of this,\u201d says Andrew Small of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research centre. \u201cAnd I think, on the Chinese side, they\u2019re aware that wishful thinking is something they can take advantage of.\u201d \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum
