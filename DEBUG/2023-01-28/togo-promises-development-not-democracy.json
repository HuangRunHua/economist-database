"Article", "articleBody": "\u201cDemocracy is the best tool we have to address the wide range of challenges we all face, \u201d President Joe Biden declared at a summit of African leaders in December, \u201cand that belief is shared by Africans and Americans alike.\u201d Some guests may have struggled to keep a straight face. Among those attending were strongmen such as Paul Kagame, who has called the shots in Rwanda for almost 30 years, and Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 (pictured), whose family has run Togo for 56 years. Although happy to offer platitudes about democracy in Washington in return for aid, at home both presidents are pushing an alternative model on their people: authoritarian rule in exchange for a promise of development.\nIt is a social contract that is increasingly popular among Africa\u2019s leaders. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation, which this week released its annual index of governance, found that more than 60% of Africans live in countries where democracy has declined over the past ten years. But in the same period measures of health care and economic development improved across most of the continent.\nBoth aspects of the deal are readily apparent in Lom\u00e9, an unusually sleepy city for a west African capital. Here a modern port and the occasional plush hotel or bank stand out from the unpaved streets that make up much of the city. \u201cA half-century of the same family in power, that\u2019s too much,\u201d confides one Togolese man, who worries the government may punish him for speaking to a journalist. \u201dThey do not like that you tell the truth,\u201d he says. \nNot that the truth is much of a secret. Ever since Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma, a former army sergeant, grabbed power in a coup in 1967, Togo has been a dynastic autocracy. After Mr Eyad\u00e9ma\u2019s death in 2005, power passed to his son, who has clung to it as the security forces have killed and tortured his opponents and spied on citizens. It is \u201ca state that surveils and punishes\u201d, says Exp\u00e9dit Ologou of Civic Academy for Africa\u2019s Future, a think-tank in Benin.\nTogo\u2019s government and its supporters do not put things in quite those terms. Bigwigs speak of emulating Singapore or Dubai, where, they imply, the curbing of political freedoms ushered in stability and prosperity. Part of Togo\u2019s strategy is to show enough technocratic leg to woo Western governments that are keen to back a stable and seemingly competent regime in an unstable region. In this Togo seems to be following not Singapore but Rwanda, a poor dictatorship that combines some progress on economic development with a brutal security service.  \nMr Gnassingb\u00e9 has also followed Mr Kagame\u2019s lead in trying to build a reputation as a development visionary. He has poured money into upgrading Lom\u00e9\u2019s port, which has increased its container volumes by a factor of about five in a decade, albeit from a very low base, to become the region\u2019s leading hub. Now all the talk is of \u201cdigital transformation\u201d and similar buzzwords. Cina Lawson, a Harvard graduate who is the \u201cdigital economy\u201d minister, is trying to cut the cost of high-speed internet to attract startups. \u201cDigital transformation provides us with a unique opportunity,\u201d she says. There is some action to go along with the talk. When covid-19 hit, the government quickly set up a scheme to send about $20 per month via mobile phones to vulnerable Togolese. \nYet the government\u2019s deal of development instead of democracy is one that most Togolese reject. More think the country is going in the wrong direction than the right one, according to Afrobarometer, a pollster. Fully 82% of Togolese think the constitution should limit the president to two terms and 68% think democracy is the best form of government. Just 17% support what, in effect, Togo has: one-party rule. \nEven those sympathetic to the dubious idea that political repression goes hand in hand with development would struggle to make a Togo a model. After a half century of family rule it is much poorer than democracies in its neighbourhood such as Ghana and Senegal. \u201cAt least in Rwanda things have advanced economically,\u201d says Aim\u00e9 Gogu\u00e9, an opposition leader. \u201cIn Togo the population continues to suffer.\u201d \u25a0", "description": "Yet it is not a deal that Togolese want to take", "ogDescription": "Yet it is not a
