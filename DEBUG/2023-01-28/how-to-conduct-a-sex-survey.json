Besides, the researchers feared people wouldn\u2019t know what it meant. \u201cFellatio\u201d was avoided for similar reasons. \u201cMaking love\u201d, \u201chaving it off\u201d, \u201cgoing all the way\u201d, \u201cgoing to bed with\u201d and \u201csleeping with\u201d were all also avoided by the authors of the questionnaires\u2014too oblique. \u201cFucking\u201d, \u201cbonking\u201d and \u201cscrewing\u201d were out too: too slangy. Research among the public indicated that they should also avoid the word \u201cabstinence\u201d (\u201cabsti-what?\u201d). But most people felt that they did have a handle on \u201cchastity\u201d: that, as one respondent put it, was \u201clike the pope or Cliff Richard\u201d.\nTalking about sex is hard. Strolling up to a stranger\u2019s house, knocking on their front door and asking them when they last had sex\u2014and if so what sort, was it with protection, and was it good\u2014that is more awkward still. It is nonetheless extremely important to do so, for the sake of public health. Which is why, for the next 12 months, around 400 interviewers, led by academics at University College London (ucl), are fanning out across Britain, armed with randomly selected addresses, carefully worded questionnaires and imperturbable expressions, to assess the nation\u2019s sexual habits. Think of it as a national passional lottery: it could be you. And if it is, brace yourself.\n\nBritain\u2019s fourth National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), which takes place every ten years and aims to interview 10,000 people, is under way. Ignore the \u201cand Lifestyles\u201d bit, which suggests that it might be about whether people are practising vegans or exercise regularly. This is about sex, plain and simple. Or rather, given that the survey has up to 607 questions and\u2014depending on how thrilling your life is\u2014takes around one hour to complete, it is more correct to say that this is about sex which is often neither plain nor simple, but which is written about in language that is both. \nTo read the Natsal survey is a soothing experience. Passion in the hands of poets is a tempestuous thing. For Sappho, it was that \u201cmonster\u201d which unbound her limbs and made her tremble; for John Donne, it was an awakening. For Natsal, passion tends to sound a little more like a gcse maths-logic problem. \u201cThinking about all of the people you have had sex with in the last five years,\u201d asks one typical question, \u201cdid any of them overlap in time? In other words did you have sex with someone (person A) then have sex with someone else (person B) then have sex with the first person (person A) again?\u201d Read the question twice, and turn the page when done.\nBut then Natsal itself arose from what was, essentially, a maths problem\u2014namely, finding out the R number (the average number of people infected by each infected person) of the HIV virus. It is possible to smirk at Natsal now, but when it began, in the mid-1980s, it was deadly serious. An appalling new disease had appeared and was spreading largely among gay men. There was \u201ctremendous fear and uncertainty\u201d, says Dame Anne Johnson, professor of epidemiology at ucl, who led the first survey. As one scientist involved put it, people worried that aids \u201cwas going to overwhelm the nation\u201d. To find out whether it would, it was necessary, as with covid-19, to find out how easily HIV was spreading. Since no one had any idea who was doing what with whom, or how often, this was all but impossible, and the idea of Natsal was born.\nCare was needed. The history of sexual surveys is fumbling. The seminal work in the discipline is Alfred Kinsey\u2019s \u201cSexual Behaviour in the Human Male\u201d, an infamously flawed bestseller published in 1948. Kinsey\u2019s questions could be leading and his focus, at best, idiosyncratic. On his \u201cContents\u201d pages, as well as the subheadings \u201cHomosexual Play\u201d and \u201cHeterosexual Play\u201d comes the more unexpected \u201cAnimal Contacts\u201d (\u201clargely\u201d, notes Kinsey, \u201cconfined to farm boys\u201d). But the main problem was that Kinsey had questioned volunteers\u2014and those who gamely volunteer for sex surveys tend to gamely volunteer for other things, too, which skews results. \nNatsal goes to considerable lengths to avoid similar flaws. Randomisation\u2014which is done first to pick an address, then to pick a person from within that address\u2014is meticulous. The response rates are high, though men are less keen on answering than women. Leading questions are avoided; language is carefully chosen. Slangy, clinical and judgmental words such as \u201cadultery\u201d are avoided and interviewers are trained in preserving what Cath Mercer, a professor of sexual-health science at UCL who is co-leading the current study, calls \u201cthat poker face\u201d. \nThe results of Natsal-4 will come out in 2025. This, says Professor Mercer, is no \u201cquick and dirty\u201d sex survey. The findings will reflect some changes in the survey itself (for the first time Natsal is asking about sexual pleasure and not just focusing on \u201cbugs and babies\u201d). The results will also doubtless reveal some changes in habits: a rise in same-sex experiences among women was one of the striking things to emerge from the previous surveys. But perhaps the main change is that Britons are increasingly comfortable discussing such things. When the survey began, says Professor Johnson, \u201cwe didn\u2019t have a language to talk about sex.\u201d There was euphemism, or poetry, or silence. Now, most are familiar with the terms that Natsal uses. \nNot that there is always much cause for them: one of the things past surveys have revealed about British sexual habits is how little sex everyone seems to be having. So perhaps the last line ought to go to the poets, after all. As Donne had it: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake hold your tongue, and let me love.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only
