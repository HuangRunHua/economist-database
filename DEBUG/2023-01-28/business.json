following their walloping in the markets in 2022 were left disappointed by Microsoft\u2019s earnings. The company reported solid revenue and profits for the final quarter of last year, but said the growth in demand for its cloud services, the main driver of its business, had softened as clients curtailed spending. It was the first of America\u2019s tech giants to publish results for the fourth quarter. Markets are nervously awaiting earnings reports from the others. \nThe word is out\nMeanwhile Microsoft confirmed that it had increased its investment in OpenAI, the startup behind the ChatGPT artificial-intelligence bot. ChatGPT has become an AI sensation since its release on the market last November. Taking direction from just a few commands, it has passed exams in law and medical licensing, and completed the final exam in the Wharton MBA programme (which may not surprise anyone who has attended business school). \nAmerica\u2019s Justice Department sued Google for anticompetitive behaviour in online advertising. The suit alleges that Google tried to limit its rivals\u2019 access to digital-ad technology by acquiring firms that develop it and wielded its dominance in the market to force advertisers and publishers to use its products. The news comes after Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, announced 12,000 job cuts, another instance of the tech industry\u2019s great retrenchment. \nIn an indication of shareholder frustration at the strategic direction of some tech firms, Elliott Management, a prolific Wall Street activist hedge fund, has reportedly taken a stake in Salesforce, one of the world\u2019s biggest software companies. Salesforce has also shed jobs to cut costs, but investors\u2019 exasperation goes beyond its hiring spree to its $28bn acquisition of Slack, which critics think was overvalued. \nReed Hastings stepped down as chief executive of Netflix, which he helped found in 1997 as a DVD rental firm. He\u2019ll remain at the company as executive chairman. The streaming company, meanwhile, said it was pleased with the progress of its new ad-supported subscription option, and that it would ban the sharing of passwords to its service by the end of March. \nAmerica\u2019s economy grew by 2.9% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, slowing slightly from the 3.2% recorded in the previous three months. GDP expanded by 2.1% for the year as a whole.  \nRupert Murdoch ditched a plan to remerge News Corporation, the newspaper side of his empire, with Fox, his television assets. The publishing and entertainment businesses were split in 2013 (21st Century Fox, the film studio, was subsequently sold to Disney). Mr Murdoch\u2019s proposal faced resistance from some News Corp investors unhappy at the prospect of being lumped together with Fox News, which they consider a toxic brand. \nA German union said that Ford is planning to cut 3,200 jobs and move some activities to America. The carmaker has not confirmed the cuts, saying only that it needs to make structural changes amid the shift to electric vehicles. Press reports suggested that Ford was considering selling one of its German factories to BYD, a Chinese maker of EVs. \nQatar\u2019s investment agency has doubled its stake in Credit Suisse and now owns 6.8% of the Swiss bank, according to a regulatory filing. It is now the second-largest shareholder in Credit Suisse, after Saudi National Bank, which holds a stake of 9.9%. \nA uniform policy\nIn Boston a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit from three former workers at Whole Foods who claimed they had been sacked illegally for wearing Black Lives Matter masks. The judge found that the company had a legitimate business interest in upholding its dress code, which applies to all slogans and logos, and found no evidence that the three employees had been targeted.\nAmazon warehouse workers in Britain held their first strike. The staff at a facility in Coventry walked out in a dispute over pay. Some claim they are monitored for their \u201cidle time\u201d, such as going to the toilet. Many Amazon employees in Europe are unionised. The company has resisted efforts to unionise in America. The first union, at a warehouse in New York, was formed only last April. \nTesla reported record quarterly revenue and net profit, which came in respectively at $24.3bn and $3.7bn. It was good news for the carmaker after it missed its annual target for delivering vehicles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk took the stand at his trial for securities fraud in relation to a spurious tweet in 2018 about taking Tesla private. Mr Musk insisted he had never intended to mislead investors and \u201cwould be sad\u201d if some had lost money as a result of the market reaction to the tweet. Asked whether the tweet\u2019s offer of $420 a share was a joke (420 is slang for cannabis) Mr Musk said it was just a coincidence, but there is some \u201ckarma around 420\u201d.", "description": "",
