They relate to payments he made before the 2016 election to a pornographic actress as hush money over an alleged fling. The charges were laid by a grand jury after the Manhattan district attorney revived the case. The violence from his supporters that some had feared ahead of Mr Trump\u2019s appearance did not materialise. Mr Trump is the first former American president to be charged with a crime. He described the case against him as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. \nThe left won two big elections in America. Brandon Johnson won Chicago\u2019s mayoral election; he was backed by teachers\u2019 unions and defeated a law-and-order candidate. And voters in Wisconsin chose a liberal judge for the state Supreme Court, ending its control by conservatives.\nRahul Gandhi, India\u2019s opposition leader, launched an appeal against his conviction for defaming Narendra Modi, the prime minister, during a speech in 2019. Mr Gandhi\u2019s conviction has resulted in him being disqualified from Parliament. His appeal starts on April 13th. \nAustralia\u2019s governing Labor Party won a seat from the opposition Liberals, the first time in over 100 years that an opposition party has lost to the government in a by-election. Aston, a suburb of Melbourne, had been a safe seat for the Liberals until last year\u2019s general election, when it became a marginal constituency. Anthony Albanese, the prime minister, is riding high in the polls, with an approval rating close to 60%. \nNajib Razak, a former prime minister of Malaysia, lost his final appeal against a corruption verdict for which he has been sentenced to 12 years in prison. Meanwhile, the Malaysian Parliament voted to scrap mandatory death sentences, giving leeway to judges to impose other punishments, such as whipping. A moratorium on executions has been in place since 2018. \nIsrael\u2019s cabinet approved the creation of a national guard under the control of the national-security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Mr Ben-Gvir is the leader of Jewish Power, a far-right party, and a ferociously anti-Arab politician. His opponents fear that he will use the force as his own publicly funded militia. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, authorised the force in order to prevent Mr Ben-Gvir from abandoning the governing coalition.\n\nEgypt and Syria agreed to strengthen relations during the first official visit by a Syrian foreign minister to Cairo in more than a decade. It represents the latest effort by Arab states to mend ties with President Bashar al-Assad.\nBurkina Faso, which experienced two military coups last year, lurched further away from France and America, which have been helping it fight a jihadist insurgency. It expelled two French journalists, one of whom had investigated a video in which Burkinab\u00e8 soldiers appear to have filmed themselves murdering teenage boys. Burkina Faso also said it wants to buy weapons from North Korea. \n\nTroops in an east African regional force recaptured the key Congolese border town of Bunagana, which had been under the control of the M23 rebel group. The regional force has been reinforced with a contingent from South Sudan and has received a pledge of soldiers from Angola, after rebels broke a ceasefire deal.\nGuillermo Lasso, the conservative president of Ecuador, denied allegations that he had been involved in graft. Mr Lasso faces an impeachment trial in May. Congress is dominated by left-wingers who are hostile to Mr Lasso, a former banker. \nSound familiar?\nJair Bolsonaro, a former president of Brazil, returned to the country after three months in the United States. Thousands of his supporters stormed government buildings in January in an attempt to overturn his narrow election defeat in October. Mr Bolsonaro faces numerous legal probes in Brazil, including into whether he incited the rioters (he denies all allegations). If found guilty, he could be barred from public office for eight years.\nThe centre-right National Coalition Party took the most seats in Finland\u2019s general election and will try to form a coalition government under Petteri Orpo. It was a bitter defeat for Sanna Marin, the outgoing prime minister, whose Social Democrats came third by the number of seats. The right-wing Finns Party came second, and took 20.1% of the vote, its best share ever. \n\nMs Marin\u2019s biggest achievement in office was steering Finland through the crisis of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Finland formally became a member of NATO this week, after Hungary and Turkey became the final two members of the military alliance to approve its application. Those two countries are still holding up Sweden\u2019s bid to join. \nFrance\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, arrived in Beijing for a visit timed to coincide with one by the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. They hoped to send a unified message to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, about how European leaders view ties with China. Mrs von der Leyen, however, has sounded more hawkish than Mr Macron, who flew to China accompanied by a large business delegation. \nAmerica\u2019s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, demanded that Russia release Evan Gershkovich, a journalist with the Wall Street Journal, who has been arrested and accused of spying for the United States. \nAn influential Russian blogger who supported Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine was assassinated by a bomb in St Petersburg.  Russia blamed Ukraine for his death; Ukraine said he was a victim of Russian in-fighting.
