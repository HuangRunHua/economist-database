Xi Jinping\u2019s thinking", "section": "China", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/13/communist-party-members-must-study-xi-jinpings-thinking", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Since Xi Jinping took over as China\u2019s leader more than a decade ago, he has kept officials on their toes. Every couple of years, on average, he has subjected them and the rest of the Communist Party\u2019s 97m members to \u201ceducation\u201d campaigns to ensure they grasp the party line (slackers beware). A new one has begun to unfold. For weeks, if not months, it will command the attention of the bureaucracy and the armed forces, as well as many businesspeople, academics and others. The theme, this time, is overtly personal. It is about keeping in step with Mr Xi himself.\nIt is probably not a response to any perceived new threat to Mr Xi\u2019s grip. The timing seems routine. It is roughly two years since the last such campaign, which focused on inculcating a highly sanitised version of the party\u2019s history. It is also about six months since the party convened a five-yearly congress, at which Mr Xi appeared to strengthen his power by replacing colleagues with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and securing a norm-breaking third term as party chief. One of those prot\u00e9g\u00e9s is Cai Qi, who last month was named as Mr Xi\u2019s chief of staff. Mr Cai also oversees ideology and propaganda in the Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-member apex of power. He is in charge of the new campaign. This is a chance to impress his boss. \nBut the scope of this latest campaign is anything but routine. The previous five ones launched by Mr Xi usually emphasised specific aspects of party members\u2019 behaviour, such as their obligation to attend to the needs of the \u201cmasses\u201d, study the party constitution, resist corruption and remember the \u201coriginal aspiration\u201d of communists. This campaign is branded Xi: it is officially described as \u201cstudy and implementation of Xi Jinping thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era\u201d. That means party members must master the broad sweep of Mr Xi\u2019s thinking on everything from maintaining discipline in the party, to the environment and national security. The new era is party-speak for the age that dawned with Mr Xi\u2019s accession as party leader in 2012. \nState media trace the history of Mr Xi\u2019s education campaigns back to Mao Zedong\u2019s \u201crectification movement\u201d of the 1940s during the party\u2019s days as a guerrilla force. They do not mention that thousands of people were killed in purges that ensued from Mao\u2019s attempts to reform party members\u2019 thinking. Today\u2019s campaigns are far more restrained, but officials still use blood-curdling language to describe the psychological impact they are intended to have. Officials are urged to \u201cturn blades upon themselves\u201d and \u201cscrape the bone to heal poison\u201d. They are required to engage in \u201ccriticism and self-criticism sessions\u201d that make their \u201cfaces turn red and sweat\u201d.  \nIn some parts of the bureaucracy the latest campaign is being combined with ongoing purges of corrupt and disloyal officials. One is the discipline-enforcement apparatus, which began a \u201crectification\u201d campaign within its ranks earlier this year. Another is the government\u2019s sports administration, which has been waging war in recent months on corruption in football. \nEducation campaigns are launched with enormous fanfare. The decision to start this one was formally endorsed by the ruling Politburo on March 30th. It was kicked off by Mr Xi himself at a gathering of officials four days later. He said it would be a \u201ctempering of the mind\u201d and a \u201cspiritual baptism\u201d that would play an important role in unifying party thinking and solving \u201cprominent problems within the party\u201d. The term is a euphemism for everything from ideological deviation to disloyalty. \nFew details of how the campaign will be implemented\u2014including a target date for completing it\u2014have been revealed. Party committees across the country have been meeting to discuss related directives, but these remain classified. Past such campaigns, however, suggest it will involve a combination of study meetings, field trips and a tool of mind control that Mao would have relished: a web portal-cum-smartphone app that tests users\u2019 knowledge of prescribed materials. It is called Xuexi Qiangguo, which means both \u201cStudy the Strong Country\u201d and \u201cStudy Xi to Make the Country Strong\u201d.\nLaunched in 2019, the app has become the bane of many party members\u2019 lives. By noting users\u2019 scores and daily usage habits it allows the party\u2019s ideological workers quickly to identify those whose minds are not on the task. Boredom with education campaigns is a common problem. A survey in 2019 (published last year) showed that nearly 60% of people at a vocational training college who had taken part in one of Mr Xi\u2019s education campaigns felt the theories they were required to study bore no obvious connection to real life, according to Li Fang, an academic in Guangzhou. Much of the teaching material was simply copied from documents supplied by higher-ups. \nNo faking it\nAs part of their education, officials will have to think more creatively. They have been told to organise research into \u201ccomplicated and difficult\u201d problems affecting the new era, such as food security or public health. They must interview people about such matters at society\u2019s grassroots, and suggest good remedies. \u201cNo going through the motions\u201d, they have been warned. \nAmong party members, many eyes will be on Mr Cai as the chief enforcer of such directives. He ranks fifth in the Politburo but his power is enormous. Not since Mao\u2019s day has the party leader\u2019s chief of staff (or director of the Central Office, as the job is formally known) served concurrently on the Politburo Standing Committee. The combination of roles will make him a formidable gatekeeper between Mr Xi and other members of the ruling elite. \nIt is clear from Mr Cai\u2019s meteoric rise that Mr Xi trusts him completely. In the 1980s and 1990s the two worked together in the province of Fujian. In 2017 Mr Cai was promoted to party chief of Beijing, without having served in the party\u2019s Central Committee (normally a rite of passage for such a job). In his new job as overseer of ideology, he has skills to draw on. Much of his work in Fujian involved internal party affairs. In the 1970s he studied political education there as an undergraduate. \nPerhaps distressingly for party members struggling with the Study-Xi app, he showed an early fondness for using digital tools to improve bureaucratic behaviour. While working in Zhejiang province in the 2010s he opened a social-media account that he used in part to castigate wrongdoing by officials. \u201cOpenness is a good thing\u201d, said one of his most-noticed tweets. He even lamented China\u2019s blocking of Facebook. Today, however, few see him as anything but Mr Xi\u2019s faithful servant. The only hope that some might possibly cling to is that he may, one day, trim the ponderous 16-character title of Mr Xi\u2019s philosophy to just \u201cXi Jinping Thought\u201d.
