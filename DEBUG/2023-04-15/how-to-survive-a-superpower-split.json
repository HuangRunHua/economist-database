As the American-led order in place since 1945 fragments and economic decoupling accelerates, they seek deals across divides. This transactional approach is reshaping geopolitics. \nOne way of capturing the sheer scale and heft of these non-aligned powers is through a Russian lens. Our sister organisation, eiu, has analysed countries based on their economic and military ties to Moscow, their diplomatic stances including votes at the un and whether they support and implement sanctions. Although 52 countries comprising 15% of the global population\u2014the West and its friends\u2014lambast and punish Russia\u2019s actions, and just 12 countries laud Russia, some 127 states are categorised as not being clearly in either camp (see map). \n\nTo get a handle on what non-alignment really means The Economist has also looked at a narrower panel of the 25 biggest economies that have sat on the fence on the Ukraine war, or wish to remain non-aligned in the Sino-American confrontation, or both. The members of this group\u2014call them the transactional 25 (t25)\u2014are hugely varied in terms of wealth and political systems, and include giant India and tiny Qatar. Yet they have some common ground. They are brutally pragmatic and have collectively become more powerful. Today they represent 45% of the world\u2019s population and their share of global gdp has risen from 11% in 1992 to 18% in 2023, more than the eu\u2019s. Their strategy of neutrality involves big risks and opportunities. Whether they succeed will influence the world order for decades. And needless to say, both America and China will work to win them over. \nIn the 20th century non-alignment meant different things to different countries at different times. At conferences in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955 and Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961, leaders presented a \u201cthird world\u201d apart from the West and the Soviet bloc. From the late 1960s these countries increasingly focused on economic inequality between the \u201cglobal south\u201d (a less loaded term for the third world) and the industrial north. A formal institution, the Non-Aligned Movement, was joined by nearly every African, Asian and Latin American state. With the end of the cold war it became, in the words of an Indian academic, \u201ca moribund organisation in need of a decent burial\u201d.\nToday, non-aligned countries are not defined by their membership of an institution, but rather by their characteristics and behaviour. These middle powers are pragmatic and opportunistic. In a recent book Jorge Heine, a former Chilean diplomat, contends that in the 20th century countries often passively drifted into one or other of the superpowers\u2019 orbits. Today there is more \u201cactive\u201d evaluation of the best means to achieve particular ends, he says. Some call it \u201cminilateralism\u201d (as opposed to multilateralism)\u2014the targeted use of discrete alliances or groupings, rather than lumping your lot in with one bloc.\nNon-aligned countries also usually think Western leaders are hypocrites. Some $170bn in aid was pledged to Ukraine in the first year of the war\u2014equivalent to about 90% of spending on all global aid in 2021 by the oecd\u2019s Development Assistance Committee, a group of 31 Western donors. To the West, such generosity shows solidarity with a fellow democracy; to others it shows that rich countries cough up if it serves their interests. \u201cEurope has to grow out of the mindset that Europe\u2019s problems are the world\u2019s problems, but the world\u2019s problems are not Europe\u2019s problems,\u201d declared Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India\u2019s foreign minister, last year.\nSuch stances are broadly in line with public opinion. A report by Cambridge University last year found that in liberal democracies 75% hold a negative view of China, and 87% do of Russia. But the picture is almost the reverse among the 6bn people who live elsewhere. A gap is opening up between how the West sees the world and how the rest sees it. In a poll published earlier this year by the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, a plurality of Indians (48%) and most Turks (51%) said the future world order will be defined by multipolarity or non-Western dominance. Just 37% of Americans, 31% of people in eu states and 29% of Britons agreed. The West thinks it is watching a sequel of the cold war; the rest of the world sees an entirely new film. \nWheeling and dealing\nSo who makes up the t25? The diverse group encompasses some of the world\u2019s most populous countries and two of its largest democracies, India and Indonesia, alongside Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which are all run by autocrats of various flavours. Large wealth disparities exist, too. In Saudi Arabia gdp per person is more than $27,000, on a par with some European countries, while in Pakistan it still lingers around just $1,600.\n\nAs globalisation has spread, the trade pattern of the t25 has become multipolar. Some 43% of merchandise trade is with the Western bloc, 19% with the China-Russia bloc and 30% with countries in neither of those camps (see chart). Perhaps unsurprisingly given its location, 77% of Mexico\u2019s total trade occurs with the West; over 60% of Israel\u2019s and Algeria\u2019s trade also does. More than a third of Chile\u2019s is with China, a higher share than any other t25 country (but 40% of its trade involves the West). More than half of Argentina\u2019s trade, and almost half of India\u2019s, is with other non-aligned countries.\nArms imports also show a complex mesh of loyalties. India hedges its bets. Between 2018 and 2022 its main supplier was Russia, which provided 45% of its arms, but it got another 29% from Europe and is likely to seek more self-reliance, with help from America. India\u2019s rival China, which supplies its arch-enemy, Pakistan, is out of the question. Israel, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and South Africa look instead to America for the vast majority of their arms imports. \nThere is no coherent governing body that represents non-aligned countries and their interests. None is expected to emerge. Instead a variety of disparate organisations, such as the g20, provide platforms of varying effectiveness for the major non-aligned countries. The brics group of countries\u2014Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa\u2014is a forum for middle powers that wants to expand: it is discussing whether to let Iran and Saudi Arabia join. At un climate talks a broader group of more than 130 countries, including China, has negotiated together.\nDespite their differences, the non-aligned countries share a common aim: to make expedient deals in a fluid environment. For two decades many were able to simultaneously build relations with the West, China and Russia. No longer. The West is imposing sanctions on Russia and restricting Chinese access to technology. \n\nFor many this is a grave threat. Sanctions on Russia saw energy and food prices soar globally, prompting a backlash across the non-Western world. More recently Janet Yellen, America\u2019s treasury secretary, has encouraged American companies to move their supply chains into friendly states. Investment shifts are under way (see chart). Beijing and Moscow, meanwhile, are drawing closer together. New research by the imf notes that since 2018 geopolitical alignment, measured by similarity in un voting patterns, has become ever more important in determining the location of foreign direct investment. Under the imf\u2019s scenarios for fractured trade, the impact in emerging markets could be more than twice as bad as in advanced ones. \nBut many in the non-aligned world bet that they can win from economic decoupling and political fragmentation, by hedging their relations between the big powers and by influencing other countries themselves. To understand this transactional strategy, look at the approach of some of the big countries caught in the middle. Brazil is a good case study. It opposes what Mauro Vieira, foreign minister, calls \u201cautomatic alignments\u201d. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who began his second stint as Brazil\u2019s president in January, sees President Joe Biden as an ally on climate change; at their meeting in Washington, dc, in February they re-established joint environmental institutions abandoned under Jair Bolsonaro, Lula\u2019s predecessor. America classes Brazil as a \u201cmajor non-nato ally\u201d, a legal status that entitles enhanced co-operation with America\u2019s armed forces. \nYet Brazil is also hedging between the superpowers. Like others in its region, it has declined Western proposals to give old Russian-made equipment to Ukraine in exchange for new arms. Lula\u2019s arrival in Beijing on April 14th will underscore China\u2019s economic importance. Trade between Brazil and China was nearly $153bn in 2022, a 37-fold increase in two decades. Partly this reflects how Brazil took advantage of tit-for-tat us-China tariffs to increase agricultural exports to China at America\u2019s expense. \nBrazil is also making forays of its own. Lula will soon visit Africa to revive Brazil\u2019s influence there. During his first stint in office, trade with Africa rose from $6bn in 2003 to $25.6bn in 2012, and South Africa was welcomed into the brics bloc. Then Lula\u2019s predecessor made no visits to Africa. Lula evidently thinks it worthwhile to renew the effort.\nIndia\u2019s fear of China has pushed it closer to the West in some respects. In March the prime minister of Japan, which like India, America and Australia, belongs to the \u201cQuad\u201d, an Indo-Pacific security forum, visited Delhi in a landmark visit. In the 2021-22 financial year India\u2019s trade with America overtook that with China. Yet India still purchases weapons and cheap oil from Russia and is unlikely to break its longstanding ties unless Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime were to use nuclear weapons.  \nPractical, not partisan\nLike Brazil, India is asserting itself more abroad: only China imports and exports more with sub-Saharan Africa. The average annual stock of fdi from India was $0.8bn in 2004 to 2008 (less than half of Sweden\u2019s) but $31bn a decade later (more than Germany\u2019s and Japan\u2019s combined). Last month India hosted representatives from 31 African countries for war games. India promises to use its chair of the g20 this year to be the \u201cvoice of the global south\u201d.\nTurkey also wants more clout across the global south. It has security agreements with 30 African states and its defence exports to Africa rose more than five-fold from 2020 to 2021. Advisers to Turkey\u2019s president say the \u201cNew Turkey\u201d can select its partners. That may explain its ostensible neutrality over the war in Ukraine, which Turkey has used to leverage its ties to Russia. Turkish exports to Russia reached $7.6bn in 2022, a 45% increase on the previous year. \nSaudi Arabia is reducing its reliance on its historical ally, America, by tilting towards China, which is now the kingdom\u2019s largest trading partner. Consider decisions this month and in October by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which Saudi Arabia dominates, to slash oil production. Last month Saudi Arabia signed a Chinese-brokered deal with Iran and joined the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a Eurasian talking shop. China says it wants to establish a free-trade deal with the Gulf \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. \nGulf countries\u2019 relations with Africa were once confined to energy, agriculture and the politics of the Horn of Africa. Today Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hunt for minerals deals; dp World, a Dubai-based ports operator, is emerging as a critical logistics firm on the continent; and Qatar is playing novel diplomatic roles. Last month it was involved in brokering the release of Paul Rusesabagina, a jailed Rwandan dissident (and the inspiration for the film \u201cHotel Rwanda\u201d). \nAfrican countries have long looked to both superpowers. The West has generally been their preferred source of \u201csoftware\u201d: support for schooling, health and, should a government want it, human rights. China offers \u201chardware\u201d: bridges, roads, ports\u2014and the loans to build them. Between 2007 and 2020 America\u2019s main development agency lent less than a tenth of the total of China\u2019s two major development banks ($1.9bn v $23bn) for sub-Saharan African infrastructure projects. \nIn some parts of Africa the West\u2019s promises to ensure security have rarely seemed as hollow. \u201cAmericans need somewhere for their troops and agents to sleep. But the security relationship does nothing for development,\u201d explains a former adviser to an African president. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need China.\u201d In August the last French troops left Mali after a nine-year deployment; the Wagner Group, comprising Russian mercenaries, now helps prop up the ruling junta.\nThe non-aligned countries want to avoid taking sides. But the big powers, America and China, are keen to draw them into their orbit. Beijing sees asserting leadership of the global south as a way of bolstering its resistance to American pressure. It positions itself as a model for others within a broad family of developing countries. It draws a contrast with the West, which it says prefers smaller clubs (like the g7). \u201cChina shows up where and when the West will not,\u201d says Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria\u2019s outgoing vice-president. \nEastern friends, western pals\nChina is the main trading partner of around 120 countries and the lender of first and last resort for many. Between 2007 and 2020 it provided more infrastructure financing in sub-Saharan Africa than the next eight lenders combined. It will be pivotal to resolving sovereign-debt crises. Analysis of 73 developing countries by the imf notes that in 2006 China held just 2% of this group\u2019s external debts, with the mostly Western \u201cParis club\u201d group of creditors accounting for 28%. By 2020 the respective shares were 18% and 10%. \nThose in the West have reason to roll their eyes. China\u2019s \u201cwin-win\u201d rhetoric masks its ruthlessness. \u201cBanking on Beijing\u201d (2022), by Bradley Parks of AidData, a research outfit, and co-authors, shows how China uses its economic tools for political ends. It often skews its funding towards incumbent leaders\u2019 home districts\u2014and is more likely than the West to lend to corrupt and autocratic countries. AidData also finds that a 10% increase in voting similarity with Beijing at the un is associated with an increase in Chinese projects in that country. Chinese loans come with unusually strict clauses on confidentiality and collateral.  But Chinese development projects are associated with boosts to gdp per person, notes Mr Parks. \nIn the face of China\u2019s efforts, America and its allies are trying to recalibrate their message to the non-aligned world. America understands that other countries\u2019 consent bestows legitimacy on the international order it leads. \u201cCountries don\u2019t want to choose, and we don\u2019t want them to,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden\u2019s national security adviser, told the Washington Post earlier this year. America is pursuing diplomacy in places it has neglected. Kamala Harris, America\u2019s vice-president, Ms Yellen and Antony Blinken, its secretary of state, have all visited Africa in 2023. Mr Biden will soon follow. \nAmerica has also bolstered security partnerships with influential non-aligned countries. In November Lloyd Austin, its defence secretary, met his Indonesian counterpart for the fourth time; in January American and Indian officials agreed to deepen co-operation on cutting-edge defence technologies. In total America maintains 88 defence \u201cpartnerships\u201d (excluding formal alliances such as its one with nato), though some are limited in scope.\nThough America and the eu have in recent years launched rival schemes to the bri, the perception remains that, if you want infrastructure that can help transform your economy, your first call is to Beijing. After Ms Harris released a soundtrack featuring African artists to accompany her recent visit to the continent, one senior African official noted, dryly, that Chinese visitors bring loans and engineers while Americans bring playlists. \nA political paradox\nThe Biden administration is widely seen as embracing a two-tier foreign policy: first come relations with its core democratic allies in Europe and Asia (which it hopes might one day include India)\u2014and then those with creaking global institutions. These mediate meet the needs of a broader group of countries, including most non-aligned ones, whether on development, debt relief, security or finance. \nThat presents three challenges. First, Western unity must hold. Yet that is not a given. During his recent visit to China Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, said that Europe\u2019s states should not become \u201cfollowers\u201d of American policy on Taiwan, nor \u201cadapt to the American rhythm\u201d.\nThe second is that China can undermine global institutions by, for instance, opting for bilateral debt relief rather than fully participating in co-ordinated efforts. Chinese creditors\u2019 obstinacy at the imf is hampering what flexibility it can offer to countries struggling with debt.\nThe final challenge concerns the mistrust of the West that is fed by its broken promises. Take climate finance, for example. In 2009 rich countries said they would channel $100bn to poorer ones per year by 2020; the annual total has never been higher than $85bn.\nBy drawing on their liberal values and shared history, America and its allies were able to rally behind Ukraine after Russia\u2019s invasion. They have shown newfound resolve against authoritarian China, too. The risk is that this coming together deepens the estrangement of the global south from the international order.

between America, China and Russia, many countries are determined not to pick sides. As the American-led order in place since 1945 fragments and economic decoupling accelerates, they seek deals across divides. This transactional approach is reshaping geopolitics. \nOne way of capturing the sheer scale and heft of these non-aligned powers is through a Russian lens. Our sister organisation, eiu, has analysed countries based on their economic and military ties to Moscow, their diplomatic stances including votes at the un and whether they support and implement sanctions. Although 52 countries comprising 15% of the global population\u2014the West and its friends\u2014lambast and punish Russia\u2019s actions, and just 12 countries laud Russia, some 127 states are categorised as not being clearly in either camp (see map). \n\nTo get a handle on what non-alignment really means The Economist has also looked at a narrower panel of the 25 biggest economies that have sat on the fence on the Ukraine war, or wish to remain non-aligned in the Sino-American confrontation, or both. The members of this group\u2014call them the transactional 25 (t25)\u2014are hugely varied in terms of wealth and political systems, and include giant India and tiny Qatar. Yet they have some common ground. They are brutally pragmatic and have collectively become more powerful. Today they represent 45% of the world\u2019s population and their share of global gdp has risen from 11% in 1992 to 18% in 2023, more than the eu\u2019s. Their strategy of neutrality involves big risks and opportunities. Whether they succeed will influence the world order for decades. And needless to say, both America and China will work to win them over. \nIn the 20th century non-alignment meant different things to different countries at different times. At conferences in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955 and Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961, leaders presented a \u201cthird world\u201d apart from the West and the Soviet bloc. From the late 1960s these countries increasingly focused on economic inequality between the \u201cglobal south\u201d (a less loaded term for the third world) and the industrial north. A formal institution, the Non-Aligned Movement, was joined by nearly every African, Asian and Latin American state. With the end of the cold war it became, in the words of an Indian academic, \u201ca moribund organisation in need of a decent burial\u201d.\nToday, non-aligned countries are not defined by their membership of an institution, but rather by their characteristics and behaviour. These middle powers are pragmatic and opportunistic. In a recent book Jorge Heine, a former Chilean diplomat, contends that in the 20th century countries often passively drifted into one or other of the superpowers\u2019 orbits. Today there is more \u201cactive\u201d evaluation of the best means to achieve particular ends, he says. Some call it \u201cminilateralism\u201d (as opposed to multilateralism)\u2014the targeted use of discrete alliances or groupings, rather than lumping your lot in with one bloc.\nNon-aligned countries also usually think Western leaders are hypocrites. Some $170bn in aid was pledged to Ukraine in the first year of the war\u2014equivalent to about 90% of spending on all global aid in 2021 by the oecd\u2019s Development Assistance Committee, a group of 31 Western donors. To the West, such generosity shows solidarity with a fellow democracy; to others it shows that rich countries cough up if it serves their interests. \u201cEurope has to grow out of the mindset that Europe\u2019s problems are the world\u2019s problems, but the world\u2019s problems are not Europe\u2019s problems,\u201d declared Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India\u2019s foreign minister, last year.\nSuch stances are broadly in line with public opinion. A report by Cambridge University last year found that in liberal democracies 75% hold a negative view of China, and 87% do of Russia. But the picture is almost the reverse among the 6bn people who live elsewhere. A gap is opening up between how the West sees the world and how the rest sees it. In a poll published earlier this year by the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, a plurality of Indians (48%) and most Turks (51%) said the future world order will be defined by multipolarity or non-Western dominance. Just 37% of Americans, 31% of people in eu states and 29% of Britons agreed. The West thinks it is watching a sequel of the cold war; the rest of the world sees an entirely new film. \nWheeling and dealing\nSo who makes up the t25? The diverse group encompasses some of the world\u2019s most populous countries and two of its largest democracies, India and Indonesia, alongside Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which are all run by autocrats of various flavours. Large wealth disparities exist, too. In Saudi Arabia gdp per person is more than $27,000, on a par with some European countries, while in Pakistan it still lingers around just $1,600.\n\nAs globalisation has spread, the trade pattern of the t25 has become multipolar. Some 43% of merchandise trade is with the Western bloc, 19% with the China-Russia bloc and 30% with countries in neither of those camps (see chart). Perhaps unsurprisingly given its location, 77% of Mexico\u2019s total trade occurs with the West; over 60% of Israel\u2019s and Algeria\u2019s trade also does. More than a third of Chile\u2019s is with China, a higher share than any other t25 country (but 40% of its trade involves the West). More than half of Argentina\u2019s trade, and almost half of India\u2019s, is with other non-aligned countries.\nArms imports also show a complex mesh of loyalties. India hedges its bets. Between 2018 and 2022 its main supplier was Russia, which provided 45% of its arms, but it got another 29% from Europe and is likely to seek more self-reliance, with help from America. India\u2019s rival China, which supplies its arch-enemy, Pakistan, is out of the question. Israel, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and South Africa look instead to America for the vast majority of their arms imports. \nThere is no coherent governing body that represents non-aligned countries and their interests. None is expected to emerge. Instead a variety of disparate organisations, such as the g20, provide platforms of varying effectiveness for the major non-aligned countries. The brics group of countries\u2014Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa\u2014is a forum for middle powers that wants to expand: it is discussing whether to let Iran and Saudi Arabia join. At un climate talks a broader group of more than 130 countries, including China, has negotiated together.\nDespite their differences, the non-aligned countries share a common aim: to make expedient deals in a fluid environment. For two decades many were able to simultaneously build relations with the West, China and Russia. No longer. The West is imposing sanctions on Russia and restricting Chinese access to technology. \n\nFor many this is a grave threat. Sanctions on Russia saw energy and food prices soar globally, prompting a backlash across the non-Western world. More recently Janet Yellen, America\u2019s treasury secretary, has encouraged American companies to move their supply chains into friendly states. Investment shifts are under way (see chart). Beijing and Moscow, meanwhile, are drawing closer together. New research by the imf notes that since 2018 geopolitical alignment, measured by similarity in un voting patterns, has become ever more important in determining the location of foreign direct investment. Under the imf\u2019s scenarios for fractured trade, the impact in emerging markets could be more than twice as bad as in advanced ones. \nBut many in the non-aligned world bet that they can win from economic decoupling and political fragmentation, by hedging their relations between the big powers and by influencing other countries themselves. To understand this transactional strategy, look at the approach of some of the big countries caught in the middle. Brazil is a good case study. It opposes what Mauro Vieira, foreign minister, calls \u201cautomatic alignments\u201d. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who began his second stint as Brazil\u2019s president in January, sees President Joe Biden as an ally on climate change; at their meeting in Washington, dc, in February they re-established joint environmental institutions abandoned under Jair Bolsonaro, Lula\u2019s predecessor. America classes Brazil as a \u201cmajor non-nato ally\u201d, a legal status that entitles enhanced co-operation with America\u2019s armed forces. \nYet Brazil is also hedging between the superpowers. Like others in its region, it has declined Western proposals to give old Russian-made equipment to Ukraine in exchange for new arms. Lula\u2019s arrival in Beijing on April 14th will underscore China\u2019s economic importance. Trade between Brazil and China was nearly $153bn in 2022, a 37-fold increase in two decades. Partly this reflects how Brazil took advantage of tit-for-tat us-China tariffs to increase agricultural exports to China at America\u2019s expense. \nBrazil is also making forays of its own. Lula will soon visit Africa to revive Brazil\u2019s influence there. During his first stint in office, trade with Africa rose from $6bn in 2003 to $25.6bn in 2012, and South Africa was welcomed into the brics bloc. Then Lula\u2019s predecessor made no visits to Africa. Lula evidently thinks it worthwhile to renew the effort.\nIndia\u2019s fear of China has pushed it closer to the West in some respects. In March the prime minister of Japan, which like India, America and Australia, belongs to the \u201cQuad\u201d, an Indo-Pacific security forum, visited Delhi in a landmark visit. In the 2021-22 financial year India\u2019s trade with America overtook that with China. Yet India still purchases weapons and cheap oil from Russia and is unlikely to break its longstanding ties unless Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime were to use nuclear weapons.  \nPractical, not partisan\nLike Brazil, India is asserting itself more abroad: only China imports and exports more with sub-Saharan Africa. The average annual stock of fdi from India was $0.8bn in 2004 to 2008 (less than half of Sweden\u2019s) but $31bn a decade later (more than Germany\u2019s and Japan\u2019s combined). Last month India hosted representatives from 31 African countries for war games. India promises to use its chair of the g20 this year to be the \u201cvoice of the global south\u201d.\nTurkey also wants more clout across the global south. It has security agreements with 30 African states and its defence exports to Africa rose more than five-fold from 2020 to 2021. Advisers to Turkey\u2019s president say the \u201cNew Turkey\u201d can select its partners. That may explain its ostensible neutrality over the war in Ukraine, which Turkey has used to leverage its ties to Russia. Turkish exports to Russia reached $7.6bn in 2022, a 45% increase on the previous year. \nSaudi Arabia is reducing its reliance on its historical ally, America, by tilting towards China, which is now the kingdom\u2019s largest trading partner. Consider decisions this month and in October by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which Saudi Arabia dominates, to slash oil production. Last month Saudi Arabia signed a Chinese-brokered deal with Iran and joined the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a Eurasian talking shop. China says it wants to establish a free-trade deal with the Gulf \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. \nGulf countries\u2019 relations with Africa were once confined to energy, agriculture and the politics of the Horn of Africa. Today Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hunt for minerals deals; dp World, a Dubai-based ports operator, is emerging as a critical logistics firm on the continent; and Qatar is playing novel diplomatic roles. Last month it was involved in brokering the release of Paul Rusesabagina, a jailed Rwandan dissident (and the inspiration for the film \u201cHotel Rwanda\u201d). \nAfrican countries have long looked to both superpowers. The West has generally been their preferred source of \u201csoftware\u201d: support for schooling, health and, should a government want it, human rights. China offers \u201chardware\u201d: bridges, roads, ports\u2014and the loans to build them. Between 2007 and 2020 America\u2019s main development agency lent less than a tenth of the total of China\u2019s two major development banks ($1.9bn v $23bn) for sub-Saharan African infrastructure projects. \nIn some parts of Africa the West\u2019s promises to ensure security have rarely seemed as hollow. \u201cAmericans need somewhere for their troops and agents to sleep. But the security relationship does nothing for development,\u201d explains a former adviser to an African president. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need China.\u201d In August the last French troops left Mali after a nine-year deployment; the Wagner Group, comprising Russian mercenaries, now helps prop up the ruling junta.\nThe non-aligned countries want to avoid taking sides. But the big powers, America and China, are keen to draw them into their orbit. Beijing sees asserting leadership of the global south as a way of bolstering its resistance to American pressure. It positions itself as a model for others within a broad family of developing countries. It draws a contrast with the West, which it says prefers smaller clubs (like the g7). \u201cChina shows up where and when the West will not,\u201d says Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria\u2019s outgoing vice-president. \nEastern friends, western pals\nChina is the main trading partner of around 120 countries and the lender of first and last resort for many. Between 2007 and 2020 it provided more infrastructure financing in sub-Saharan Africa than the next eight lenders combined. It will be pivotal to resolving sovereign-debt crises. Analysis of 73 developing countries by the imf notes that in 2006 China held just 2% of this group\u2019s external debts, with the mostly Western \u201cParis club\u201d group of creditors accounting for 28%. By 2020 the respective shares were 18% and 10%. \nThose in the West have reason to roll their eyes. China\u2019s \u201cwin-win\u201d rhetoric masks its ruthlessness. \u201cBanking on Beijing\u201d (2022), by Bradley Parks of AidData, a research outfit, and co-authors, shows how China uses its economic tools for political ends. It often skews its funding towards incumbent leaders\u2019 home districts\u2014and is more likely than the West to lend to corrupt and autocratic countries. AidData also finds that a 10% increase in voting similarity with Beijing at the un is associated with an increase in Chinese projects in that country. Chinese loans come with unusually strict clauses on confidentiality and collateral.  But Chinese development projects are associated with boosts to gdp per person, notes Mr Parks. \nIn the face of China\u2019s efforts, America and its allies are trying to recalibrate their message to the non-aligned world. America understands that other countries\u2019 consent bestows legitimacy on the international order it leads. \u201cCountries don\u2019t want to choose, and we don\u2019t want them to,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden\u2019s national security adviser, told the Washington Post earlier this year. America is pursuing diplomacy in places it has neglected. Kamala Harris, America\u2019s vice-president, Ms Yellen and Antony Blinken, its secretary of state, have all visited Africa in 2023. Mr Biden will soon follow. \nAmerica has also bolstered security partnerships with influential non-aligned countries. In November Lloyd Austin, its defence secretary, met his Indonesian counterpart for the fourth time; in January American and Indian officials agreed to deepen co-operation on cutting-edge defence technologies. In total America maintains 88 defence \u201cpartnerships\u201d (excluding formal alliances such as its one with nato), though some are limited in scope.\nThough America and the eu have in recent years launched rival schemes to the bri, the perception remains that, if you want infrastructure that can help transform your economy, your first call is to Beijing. After Ms Harris released a soundtrack featuring African artists to accompany her recent visit to the continent, one senior African official noted, dryly, that Chinese visitors bring loans and engineers while Americans bring playlists. \nA political paradox\nThe Biden administration is widely seen as embracing a two-tier foreign policy: first come relations with its core democratic allies in Europe and Asia (which it hopes might one day include India)\u2014and then those with creaking global institutions. These mediate meet the needs of a broader group of countries, including most non-aligned ones, whether on development, debt relief, security or finance. \nThat presents three challenges. First, Western unity must hold. Yet that is not a given. During his recent visit to China Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, said that Europe\u2019s states should not become \u201cfollowers\u201d of American policy on Taiwan, nor \u201cadapt to the American rhythm\u201d.\nThe second is that China can undermine global institutions by, for instance, opting for bilateral debt relief rather than fully participating in co-ordinated efforts. Chinese creditors\u2019 obstinacy at the imf is hampering what flexibility it can offer to countries struggling with debt.\nThe final challenge concerns the mistrust of the West that is fed by its broken promises. Take climate finance, for example. In 2009 rich countries said they would channel $100bn to poorer ones per year by 2020; the annual total has never been higher than $85bn.\nBy drawing on their liberal values and shared history, America and its allies were able to rally behind Ukraine after Russia\u2019s invasion. They have shown newfound resolve against authoritarian China, too. The risk is that this coming together deepens the estrangement of the global south from the international order. It would be a tragic result if, in uniting the West, America alienates the rest.\u25a0\nCorrection (April 12th): The map in this piece was changed to sort an error in the categorisation of some countries.", "description": "We analyse the crafty countries that don\u2019t want to pick sides", "ogDescription": "We analyse the crafty countries that don\u2019t want to pick sides", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230415_IRD001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-04-11T20:45:15Z", "dateModified": "2023-04-13T17:14:46Z", "dateCreated": "2023-04-11T20:44:57Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-04-15T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "BEIJING AND JOHANNESBURG", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/d94s2un3ibdoij5fo94f5hiititutgf4", "publication": [{"id": "/content/hoqoi9l5t7v1g3km772m1id3v2v1t0fr", "context": {"position": 1300.41, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/kce3bhvhg57m3jji460h7ifn5tos1jt0", "context": {"position": 1300.41, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r9of70si8af0nm5ocnmlbs4uin011d69", "context": {"position": 1300.41, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g65alsp6875bu9ehhp4ve5fo64f1vf2r", "context": {"position": 1300.41, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/hj1uq46tkevmcou02kk8g2f7rcdevps9", "context": {"position": 1300.41, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/mou1gib3rmj4m8ov7esog93j33dfq1la", "context": {"position": 1300.41, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/qahlng19apr0t51jsf0sc8gf62h1gcbi", "context": {"position": 1300.41, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "How to survive a superpower split", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/international/2023/04/11/how-to-survive-a-superpower-split", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
