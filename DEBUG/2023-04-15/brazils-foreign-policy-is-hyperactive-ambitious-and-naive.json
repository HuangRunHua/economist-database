He helped found the BRICS\u2014a bloc of emerging economies that includes Russia, India, China and South Africa\u2014and irked the United States by trying to broker a deal over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme together with Turkey, which would have allowed Iran to ship enriched uranium to Turkey rather than close down its programme.\nYet while Lula\u2019s international ambitions have remained grand, Brazil and the world have changed since he was last in office. Brazil is more polarised and Lula\u2019s domestic support has diminished: he won the election last year with a 1.8 percentage-point margin, the narrowest victory since Brazil\u2019s return to democracy in 1989. China is no longer an emerging market but a world power. War has broken out in Europe and human-rights violations in Latin America have worsened. All this has increased the costs of being chummy with everyone. In Lula\u2019s third term, Brazil\u2019s commitment to non-alignment will be severely tested. By trying to play the role of global peacemaker, Lula risks looking naive rather than like an elder statesman.\nIn many ways, Lula\u2019s active diplomacy represents a continuation of Brazilian tradition. Brazil comprises a third of Latin America\u2019s population and almost the same share of its GDP. It fought alongside the Allies in both world wars and has long clamoured for a permanent seat at the UN Security Council. Its mediation in local conflicts has helped make South America the region with the fewest interstate wars. The constitution from 1988 says that foreign policy should be based on non-intervention, the peaceful settlement of conflicts and \u201cequality among states\u201d. \nBrazil\u2019s foreign policy suffered under Lula\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Dilma Rousseff, who succeeded him as president, and under her successor, Michel Temer, who turned inwards after economic mismanagement by Ms Rousseff led to a deep recession in the mid-2010s. Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who was president from 2019 to 2022, worsened matters. He bashed China and mostly visited other nationalists, such as Donald Trump. His enthusiastic support for deforestation made Brazil an international pariah. Lula wants to fix this legacy. \nHis first balancing act will be managing the rivalry between the United States and China. Mauro Vieira, Lula\u2019s foreign minister, has said that Brazil will not have \u201cautomatic alignments\u201d. At their meeting, Lula and Mr Biden focused on democratic values, human rights and the environment. They bonded over their similar experiences with insurrectionists. (Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters attacked government buildings in January, much as some of Mr Trump\u2019s supporters did in January 2021.) Yet, though officials say the trip was a success, the outcome was underwhelming. The United States signalled an intention to donate $50m to the Amazon Fund, a billion-dollar mechanism to reduce deforestation. Germany recently committed more than four times as much. \nWhere\u2019s the beef?\nBy contrast, the agenda with China is more \u201cconcrete, wide-ranging and far-reaching\u201d, says Sergio Amaral, Brazil\u2019s former ambassador to the United States. The trip, originally scheduled for March, was postponed after Lula contracted pneumonia. It was to have included a delegation of five ministers, dozens of legislators and 240 business representatives. \nSigns of goodwill abounded ahead of the original trip. Days before, China lifted a suspension on buying Brazilian beef that had been imposed a month earlier, after a case of mad-cow disease was discovered in Brazil. Under Mr Bolsonaro it took three months to get a similar ban lifted. Brazil\u2019s government is taking steps to allow trade to be settled in yuan, China\u2019s currency. It may sign up to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, an infrastructure programme.\n\nMore than 20 agreements are expected to be signed on the rescheduled trip, ranging from investments in renewable energy to co-operation on science and technology. Marina Silva, Brazil\u2019s environment minister, told The Economist that a priority is to seek investments in renewables, particularly in green hydrogen, a fuel that can be made using solar and wind power. Another important area is satellites. But any new deals could unnerve the United States, which worries that satellites could be used to monitor military activity. \nMost of the agreements will be about foodstuffs. A third of the business representatives in the original delegation\u2014many of whom arrived before Lula postponed his first trip\u2014came from the agriculture sector. Marcio Rodrigues, the head of exports at Masterboi, a meat-packing giant, was in Beijing in March. He says \u201cthe Chinese were very receptive\u201d and points out that, despite Lula not being present, several beef, pork and chicken companies got licences to export to China. Brazil also wants to diversify and add higher-value goods to its export basket. In November China opened its market to Brazilian maize. Now Brazil is set to rival the United States as the world\u2019s biggest exporter of the stuff. Rice and certain types of fruits, such as grapes and limes, could be next.\nThe weight of the agribusiness delegation reflects the nature of the relationship, which is built on the back of Brazilian commodities exports. China surpassed the United States to become Brazil\u2019s biggest trading partner in 2009. Today it imports from Brazil almost two-thirds of its soyabeans, two-fifths of its beef, and a fifth of its iron ore. Yet the United States remains by far the largest investor in terms of FDI. In 2020 it held $124bn in investments in Brazil, compared with only $23bn from China, according to Brazil\u2019s central bank. Much of what Brazil exports to the United States, meanwhile, is of higher value, including planes and steel. \u201cWe depend on both countries,\u201d says Dawisson Bel\u00e9m Lopes of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Deepening trade with China is unlikely to vex the United States. \nLula may alienate Brazil\u2019s partners in his ambitions to be a global peacemaker. His earlier attempts to broker a deal over Iran riled the United States. Lula does not appear to have learnt the lesson. His proposal to set up a \u201cpeace club\u201d to end the war in Ukraine annoys both the West, which believes Lula has been too soft on Russia, and Xi Jinping, who has his own plan. \n  Worth fighting for\n\nSo far Lula\u2019s attempts at non-alignment have seemed rather one-sided. Although Brazil voted at the UN to condemn Russia for invading Ukraine, Lula has said that Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, is \u201cas responsible as Putin for the war\u201d. In January he reiterated the point after rejecting Germany\u2019s request to send ammunition to Ukraine.\nHe has since softened his language. On April 6th he acknowledged that Russia \u201ccannot keep the Ukrainian territory\u201d it has captured since 2022, though he suggested Ukraine may have to surrender Crimea. Even so, when Lula\u2019s top foreign-policy adviser, Celso Amorim, went to Europe in March, he met Mr Putin in Moscow but did not visit Ukraine. The most Lula has done is to Skype with Mr Zelensky. Russia is not just a partner in the BRICS, but supplies a quarter of Brazil\u2019s fertilisers. That Mr Amorim met with Mr Putin, rather than someone of similar rank, suggests Russia benefits from playing up ties to Brazil, too.\n\u201cIf you want to be taken seriously in a conversation to moderate this conflict, you have to visit both sides,\u201d says Bruna Santos of the Wilson Centre, an American think-tank. Beyond appearing partial, Lula risks looking naive. Brazil lacks the geopolitical heft to get either Ukraine or Russia to stick to the terms of a deal, says Oliver Stuenkel of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university. \u201cThere is still a perception that the worst that can happen is that Brazil\u2019s peace initiative just doesn\u2019t have the desired effect. But there is actually a risk that it could undermine Brazil\u2019s relationship with Europe and the United States.\u201d \nBrazil has better chances of mediating closer to home. Shortly before Mr Amorim went to Moscow he met Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s autocrat, and members of the Venezuelan opposition (presidential elections are due there next year). Since returning to power, Lula has revived moribund talking shops on regional co-operation, and is pushing for a deal between the European Union and Mercosur, a trade bloc composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, to be ratified this year. But he may struggle to be an honest broker in Nicaragua, which is ruled by Daniel Ortega, a dictator. Lula compared Mr Ortega\u2019s 16-year rule, consolidated by persecuting rivals, to Angela Merkel\u2019s democratic tenure of a similar length in Germany. That will hardly endear him to the opposition.\nBrazil will, however, have a chance to play a leading role in climate-change policy. Lula is pushing to host COP30, an environmental pow-wow, in 2025. He is also seeking to reactivate the Amazon Pact, a treaty from 1978 that brings together the eight countries that share the rainforest. Between 2004 and 2012 the annual rate of deforestation in the Amazon fell by 80% thanks in part to tougher laws promoted by Ms Silva, Lula\u2019s climate tsar at the time. She is now back in her old job.\nAll this means that Brazil is already a global power on the biggest issue for humanity\u2019s future. Lula\u2019s legacy may be better served by spending his energy on areas where Brazil has clout, such as the environment, rather than on grand political topics where it has little or none. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Back in the big league", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "The Americas"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/u9avqma9ca3p14gs9dp3hjvt3ebg1mr5", "tegID": "u9avqma9ca3p14gs9dp3hjvt3ebg1mr5", "headline": "The Americas", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/13/uruguay-is-losing-its-reputation-as-latin-americas-success-story", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/1r5r6bnrj0k3jfajk4sevtpj9u1867j6", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Uruguay is losing its reputation as Latin America\u2019s success story", "subheadline": "Losing its sheen", "datePublished": "2023-04-13T13:28:56Z", "description": "Crime and corruption scandals have hurt Luis Lacalle Pou, the conservative president", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230415_AMP501.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/13/an-ambitious-plan-for-total-peace-in-colombia-is-faltering", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/nfe5p9j899fst1n4655c5ctqf3sdobak", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "An ambitious plan for \u201ctotal peace\u201d in Colombia is faltering", "subheadline": "Total chaos", "datePublished": "2023-04-13T13:28:56Z", "description": "Gustavo Petro\u2019s central policy looks shakier than ever", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230415_AMP004.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/10/brazils-foreign-policy-is-hyperactive-ambitious-and-naive", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/tqfsuih1vhvl930gdrp2bbnhk7rhvokv", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Brazil\u2019s foreign policy is hyperactive, ambitious and naive", "subheadline": "Back in the big league", "datePublished": "2023-04-10T15:27:48Z", "description": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva goes to Beijing with grand plans of a \u201cpeace club\u201d over Ukraine", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230415_AMP001.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/05/evangelicals-may-soon-rival-catholics-in-latin-america", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/4ad5m3gqqa56irhg88uf6ml7s18csdoj", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Evangelicals may soon rival Catholics in Latin America", "subheadline": "Prophets of the ballot box", "datePublished": "2023-04-05T14:42:55Z", "description": "A fifth of the region are evangelical.

Brazil\u2019s president in October, his victory speech hinted at his global ambitions: \u201cToday we say to the world that Brazil is back.\u201d In his first 100 days in office Lula, as he is known, has tried to prove this with a series of trips abroad. In January he visited his Argentine counterpart. In February he went to the United States to meet President Joe Biden. On April 14th, as The Economist went to press, he was due to meet Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, in Beijing. Next week Sergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, will visit Brazil. Lula also wants to lead the fight against climate change and to set up a \u201cpeace club\u201d to end the war in Ukraine. His top foreign policy aide secretly travelled to Moscow to discuss the idea with Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, in March. \nMuch as in his first two terms in office between 2003 and 2010, Lula wants Brazil to have a seat at the table on the thorniest issues of the day. His ambitions should be taken seriously. As president in the early 2000s, Lula charted a pragmatic, independent diplomacy that was bent on pursuing Brazilian interests and creating a \u201cmultipolar\u201d world at a time of American hegemony. He helped found the BRICS\u2014a bloc of emerging economies that includes Russia, India, China and South Africa\u2014and irked the United States by trying to broker a deal over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme together with Turkey, which would have allowed Iran to ship enriched uranium to Turkey rather than close down its programme.\nYet while Lula\u2019s international ambitions have remained grand, Brazil and the world have changed since he was last in office. Brazil is more polarised and Lula\u2019s domestic support has diminished: he won the election last year with a 1.8 percentage-point margin, the narrowest victory since Brazil\u2019s return to democracy in 1989. China is no longer an emerging market but a world power. War has broken out in Europe and human-rights violations in Latin America have worsened. All this has increased the costs of being chummy with everyone. In Lula\u2019s third term, Brazil\u2019s commitment to non-alignment will be severely tested. By trying to play the role of global peacemaker, Lula risks looking naive rather than like an elder statesman.\nIn many ways, Lula\u2019s active diplomacy represents a continuation of Brazilian tradition. Brazil comprises a third of Latin America\u2019s population and almost the same share of its GDP. It fought alongside the Allies in both world wars and has long clamoured for a permanent seat at the UN Security Council. Its mediation in local conflicts has helped make South America the region with the fewest interstate wars. The constitution from 1988 says that foreign policy should be based on non-intervention, the peaceful settlement of conflicts and \u201cequality among states\u201d. \nBrazil\u2019s foreign policy suffered under Lula\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Dilma Rousseff, who succeeded him as president, and under her successor, Michel Temer, who turned inwards after economic mismanagement by Ms Rousseff led to a deep recession in the mid-2010s. Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who was president from 2019 to 2022, worsened matters. He bashed China and mostly visited other nationalists, such as Donald Trump. His enthusiastic support for deforestation made Brazil an international pariah. Lula wants to fix this legacy. \nHis first balancing act will be managing the rivalry between the United States and China. Mauro Vieira, Lula\u2019s foreign minister, has said that Brazil will not have \u201cautomatic alignments\u201d. At their meeting, Lula and Mr Biden focused on democratic values, human rights and the environment. They bonded over their similar experiences with insurrectionists. (Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters attacked government buildings in January, much as some of Mr Trump\u2019s supporters did in January 2021.) Yet, though officials say the trip was a success, the outcome was underwhelming. The United States signalled an intention to donate $50m to the Amazon Fund, a billion-dollar mechanism to reduce deforestation. Germany recently committed more than four times as much. \nWhere\u2019s the beef?\nBy contrast, the agenda with China is more \u201cconcrete, wide-ranging and far-reaching\u201d, says Sergio Amaral, Brazil\u2019s former ambassador to the United States. The trip, originally scheduled for March, was postponed after Lula contracted pneumonia. It was to have included a delegation of five ministers, dozens of legislators and 240 business representatives. \nSigns of goodwill abounded ahead of the original trip. Days before, China lifted a suspension on buying Brazilian beef that had been imposed a month earlier, after a case of mad-cow disease was discovered in Brazil. Under Mr Bolsonaro it took three months to get a similar ban lifted. Brazil\u2019s government is taking steps to allow trade to be settled in yuan, China\u2019s currency. It may sign up to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, an infrastructure programme.\n\nMore than 20 agreements are expected to be signed on the rescheduled trip, ranging from investments in renewable energy to co-operation on science and technology. Marina Silva, Brazil\u2019s environment minister, told The Economist that a priority is to seek investments in renewables, particularly in green hydrogen, a fuel that can be made using solar and wind power. Another important area is satellites. But any new deals could unnerve the United States, which worries that satellites could be used to monitor military activity. \nMost of the agreements will be about foodstuffs. A third of the business representatives in the original delegation\u2014many of whom arrived before Lula postponed his first trip\u2014came from the agriculture sector. Marcio Rodrigues, the head of exports at Masterboi, a meat-packing giant, was in Beijing in March. He says \u201cthe Chinese were very receptive\u201d and points out that, despite Lula not being present, several beef, pork and chicken companies got licences to export to China. Brazil also wants to diversify and add higher-value goods to its export basket. In November China opened its market to Brazilian maize. Now Brazil is set to rival the United States as the world\u2019s biggest exporter of the stuff. Rice and certain types of fruits, such as grapes and limes, could be next.\nThe weight of the agribusiness delegation reflects the nature of the relationship, which is built on the back of Brazilian commodities exports. China surpassed the United States to become Brazil\u2019s biggest trading partner in 2009. Today it imports from Brazil almost two-thirds of its soyabeans, two-fifths of its beef, and a fifth of its iron ore. Yet the United States remains by far the largest investor in terms of FDI. In 2020 it held $124bn in investments in Brazil, compared with only $23bn from China, according to Brazil\u2019s central bank. Much of what Brazil exports to the United States, meanwhile, is of higher value, including planes and steel. \u201cWe depend on both countries,\u201d says Dawisson Bel\u00e9m Lopes of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Deepening trade with China is unlikely to vex the United States. \nLula may alienate Brazil\u2019s partners in his ambitions to be a global peacemaker. His earlier attempts to broker a deal over Iran riled the United States. Lula does not appear to have learnt the lesson. His proposal to set up a \u201cpeace club\u201d to end the war in Ukraine annoys both the West, which believes Lula has been too soft on Russia, and Xi Jinping, who has his own plan. \n  Worth fighting for\n\nSo far Lula\u2019s attempts at non-alignment have seemed rather one-sided. Although Brazil voted at the UN to condemn Russia for invading Ukraine, Lula has said that Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, is \u201cas responsible as Putin for the war\u201d. In January he reiterated the point after rejecting Germany\u2019s request to send ammunition to Ukraine.\nHe has since softened his language. On April 6th he acknowledged that Russia \u201ccannot keep the Ukrainian territory\u201d it has captured since 2022, though he suggested Ukraine may have to surrender Crimea. Even so, when Lula\u2019s top foreign-policy adviser, Celso Amorim, went to Europe in March, he met Mr Putin in Moscow but did not visit Ukraine. The most Lula has done is to Skype with Mr Zelensky. Russia is not just a partner in the BRICS, but supplies a quarter of Brazil\u2019s fertilisers. That Mr Amorim met with Mr Putin, rather than someone of similar rank, suggests Russia benefits from playing up ties to Brazil, too.\n\u201cIf you want to be taken seriously in a conversation to moderate this conflict, you have to visit both sides,\u201d says Bruna Santos of the Wilson Centre, an American think-tank. Beyond appearing partial, Lula risks looking naive. Brazil lacks the geopolitical heft to get either Ukraine or Russia to stick to the terms of a deal, says Oliver Stuenkel of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university. \u201cThere is still a perception that the worst that can happen is that Brazil\u2019s peace initiative just doesn\u2019t have the desired effect. But there is actually a risk that it could undermine Brazil\u2019s relationship with Europe and the United States.\u201d \nBrazil has better chances of mediating closer to home. Shortly before Mr Amorim went to Moscow he met Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s autocrat, and members of the Venezuelan opposition (presidential elections are due there next year). Since returning to power, Lula has revived moribund talking shops on regional co-operation, and is pushing for a deal between the European Union and Mercosur, a trade bloc composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, to be ratified this year. But he may struggle to be an honest broker in Nicaragua, which is ruled by Daniel Ortega, a dictator. Lula compared Mr Ortega\u2019s 16-year rule, consolidated by persecuting rivals, to Angela Merkel\u2019s democratic tenure of a similar length in Germany. That will hardly endear him to the opposition.\nBrazil will, however, have a chance to play a leading role in climate-change policy. Lula is pushing to host COP30, an environmental pow-wow, in 2025. He is also seeking to reactivate the Amazon Pact, a treaty from 1978 that brings together the eight countries that share the rainforest. Between 2004 and 2012 the annual rate of deforestation in the Amazon fell by 80% thanks in part to tougher laws promoted by Ms Silva, Lula\u2019s climate tsar at the time. She is now back in her old job.\nAll this means that Brazil is already a global power on the biggest issue for humanity\u2019s future. Lula\u2019s legacy may be better served by spending his energy on areas where Brazil has clout, such as the environment, rather than on grand political topics where it has little or none. \u25a0", "description": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva goes to Beijing with grand plans of a \u201cpeace club\u201d over Ukraine", "ogDescription": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva goes to Beijing with grand plans of a \u201cpeace club\u201d over Ukraine", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230415_AMP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-04-10T15:27:48Z", "dateModified": "2023-04-13T17:14:46Z", "dateCreated": "2023-04-10T15:27:43Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-04-15T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "S\u00e3o Paulo", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/1r5r6bnrj0k3jfajk4sevtpj9u1867j6", "publication": [{"id": "/content/hoqoi9l5t7v1g3km772m1id3v2v1t0fr", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/kce3bhvhg57m3jji460h7ifn5tos1jt0", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r9of70si8af0nm5ocnmlbs4uin011d69", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g65alsp6875bu9ehhp4ve5fo64f1vf2r", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/hj1uq46tkevmcou02kk8g2f7rcdevps9", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/mou1gib3rmj4m8ov7esog93j33dfq1la", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/qahlng19apr0t51jsf0sc8gf62h1gcbi", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Uruguay is losing its reputation as Latin America\u2019s success story", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/13/uruguay-is-losing-its-reputation-as-latin-americas-success-story", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/nfe5p9j899fst1n4655c5ctqf3sdobak", "publication": [{"id": "/content/hoqoi9l5t7v1g3km772m1id3v2v1t0fr", "context": {"position": 600.29, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/kce3bhvhg57m3jji460h7ifn5tos1jt0", "context": {"position": 600.29, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r9of70si8af0nm5ocnmlbs4uin011d69", "context": {"position": 600.29, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g65alsp6875bu9ehhp4ve5fo64f1vf2r", "context": {"position": 600.29, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/hj1uq46tkevmcou02kk8g2f7rcdevps9", "context": {"position": 600.29, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/mou1gib3rmj4m8ov7esog93j33dfq1la", "context": {"position": 600.29, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/qahlng19apr0t51jsf0sc8gf62h1gcbi", "context": {"position": 600.29, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "An ambitious plan for \u201ctotal peace\u201d in Colombia is faltering", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/13/an-ambitious-plan-for-total-peace-in-colombia-is-faltering", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/tqfsuih1vhvl930gdrp2bbnhk7rhvokv", "publication": [{"id": "/content/hoqoi9l5t7v1g3km772m1id3v2v1t0fr", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/kce3bhvhg57m3jji460h7ifn5tos1jt0", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r9of70si8af0nm5ocnmlbs4uin011d69", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g65alsp6875bu9ehhp4ve5fo64f1vf2r", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/hj1uq46tkevmcou02kk8g2f7rcdevps9", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/mou1gib3rmj4m8ov7esog93j33dfq1la", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/qahlng19apr0t51jsf0sc8gf62h1gcbi", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Brazil\u2019s foreign policy is hyperactive, ambitious and naive", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/10/brazils-foreign-policy-is-hyperactive-ambitious-and-naive", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
