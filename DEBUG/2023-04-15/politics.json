briefly met the main parties in Northern Ireland. The settlement has ensured peace in the province but getting the politics to work has been harder. The agreement requires unionists and nationalists to share power but the devolved assembly has not sat for 40% of the time since 1998, and is suspended now too. The American president then spent three days in Ireland, visiting his ancestral homeland.\nMr Biden tried to reassure America\u2019s allies that there would be no more leaks of classified intelligence, after the release of a trove of documents online from an unknown source. The sensitive materials show the extent of America\u2019s involvement in Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia, including details of Ukrainian battle strengths and weapon deliveries. It was the biggest leak of top-secret information since Edward Snowden\u2019s leak of military papers in 2013. \nIn Ukraine Russia stepped up its bombardments in the front-line Donetsk region, as the battle raged for control of the small but strategically important town of Bakhmut. The commander of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces said the Russians had switched to the type of \u201cscorched earth\u201d tactics that they had used in Syria defending the Assad regime. \nThe Biden administration filed an appeal against a judge\u2019s ruling  that would suspend the sale of mifepristone, an abortion pill. The judge sided with an anti-abortion group in deciding that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of mifepristone in 2000 was unsafe, despite few safety concerns being raised during the 23 years it has been on sale. \nDriving the agenda\nAmerica\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency proposed its most stringent measures to date to reduce car emissions. The new standards are intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. The EPA thinks the new rules will result in EVs accounting for 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales by 2032.  Carmakers were taken by surprise. They are working towards an EV target of 40-50% of car sales by 2030. \nClarence Thomas, a justice on America\u2019s Supreme Court, defended trips he had taken on a jet owned by Harlan Crow, a generous donor to the Republicans, describing him as a close friend with whom he has taken family holidays for 25 years. News of the trips sparked more criticism of the court\u2019s lack of transparency.\nPalestinian militants fired salvoes of rockets into Israel from Gaza, Lebanon and Syria after clashes between Israeli police and protesters on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem; Palestinian gunmen shot and killed three British-Israeli women in the West Bank; and an Arab-Israeli rammed a car into pedestrians in Tel Aviv, killing an Italian tourist. Meanwhile Israel\u2019s embattled prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, reinstated Yoav Gallant as defence minister. His sacking had triggered huge protests and strikes.\n\nPirates seized a Singaporean-registered oil tanker in the Gulf of Guinea. It was the second attack in recent weeks. Pirates boarded a Danish-owned oil tanker and kidnapped some of its crew last month. \nA court in the United Arab Emirates turned down a South African request for the extradition of Atul and Rajesh Gupta, two brothers who are accused of looting state-owned companies during the presidency of Jacob Zuma. \n\nEthiopia\u2019s government said it would disband militias formed by regional governments and integrate their members into the regular police and army. Violent clashes broke out in the Amhara region as people protested against the plan.\nOver three days of military drills China simulated a blockade and \u201cprecision strikes\u201d on Taiwan, the self-governing island that it claims.
