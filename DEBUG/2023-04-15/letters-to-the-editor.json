If asked if it is moral to throw a switch so that a runaway trolley kills a few repairmen on the track to save a much larger number of passengers, the majority said yes. But if asked if it was moral to push one obese person onto the track to save the many the majority said no. The MRI scans showed that only the second scenario activated brain centres involved in emotions and moral choices.\nRichard Waugaman\nClinical professor of psychiatry\nGeorgetown University\nWashington, DC\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin is among the most important scientists to have tackled this problem. As both a scientist and a Jesuit, he showed how scientific theories, among them the Big Bang and Charles Darwin\u2019s work on evolution, could lead to the existence of God, and to another world for humanity. But he also wrote about the evidentiary irrelevance of some Christian dogmas, such as original sin. He used science to give a stronger basis for Christian faith. Needless to say some members of the Catholic church thought he was a heretic and some of his writings were not published until after his death in 1955.\nDenis Apvrille\nMember of the Association des Amis de Teilhard de Chardin\nLab\u00e8ge, France\n\nSubversive creativity\nI read your leader on the future of video games with a groan (\u201cStorm forming\u201d, March 25th). Video games have long been an escape for Western youth. For Generation Z they are an excuse to go wild, create fantasy lands, and be beyond the reach of parental supervision. The corporate push to consolidate and moderate content is another sign that the presence of \u201cthe man\u201d (our parents, anyone over the age of 35), is going to dampen the creative chaos and cathartic relief that video games provide.\nThe business successfully survived attempts in the 1990s and 2000s to censor games like \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d, in part because the game became a sign of teen rebellion and mostly because video-game developers did not have to pander to parents, who were not GTA\u2019s audience or the developer\u2019s market. Now that older generations have been co-opted into video gaming its rebellious nature will suffer as developers try to create games that appeal to little Johnny, Uncle Jimmy and all.\nKellen McGovern Jones\nFort Worth, Texas\n\nBarbie girls and boys\nSchumpeter should not be embarrassed by his excitement about \u201cBarbie\u201d (March 25th). It is eagerly awaited among cinephiles. I will watch it before Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d, which comes out the same day. We\u2019ve seen plenty of atomic bombs on the big screen; Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling playing toy dolls is uncharted territory.\nJames Jiang\nNew York\nIt\u2019s no small thing\nAs a man standing five feet and five inches I can assure you that height plays a significant part in a man\u2019s ability to find dates and partners (Graphic detail, March 25th). Ditto to being America\u2019s president. And probably everything in between. I am a married attorney, by the way. \nBRIAN SHEPPARD\nEncino, California", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "On China and Ukraine, George Orwell, science

Russia\u2019s catastrophic and illegal war in Ukraine (\u201cThe world according to Xi\u201d, March 25th) China is also in breach of the China-Ukraine Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation, under which Beijing assured Kyiv in 2013 that it would help Ukraine defend itself. Through the treaty Ukraine recognised that \u201cthere is only one China in the world\u201d and the People\u2019s Republic of China \u201cis the only legal government representing China\u201d. Ukraine agreed that \u201cTaiwan is an inseparable part of China\u201d. In return, China supported efforts to protect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Article 6 went further, stating that neither country shall take actions that damage the sovereignty of the other or permit third countries to damage either countries\u2019 territorial integrity.\nChina\u2019s violation of this treaty is the thin end of a dangerous geopolitical wedge. Western democracies should be under no illusion about the scale of China\u2019s implicit ambition in cultivating a weak Russia. It is precisely that ambition to which President Xi Jinping was referring when he told Vladimir Putin in Moscow that, \u201cChange is coming that hasn\u2019t happened in 100 years and we are driving this change together.\u201d\nThat change includes Beijing\u2019s ambition to dominate the world. This includes a new concept of conflict across a spectrum of information war, cyberwar and high-end hyper-war. In Mr Xi\u2019s worldview, treaties are merely instruments to constrain and confuse adversaries. Therefore, if China and its vassal Russia succeed there will be a return to the kind of world which preceded both world wars and the destruction of the very institutions which, since 1945, have helped to militate against extreme state aggression.\nIt would thus be helpful now to remind President Xi of China\u2019s responsibilities and its obligations under the China-Ukraine treaty, and to encourage him to cease his further support of Russia\u2019s illegal endeavours in Ukraine. In dealing with Mr Xi\u2019s China the West must speak softly and carry a big stick. \nAir-marshal Sir Christopher Harper\nFormer director-general of the NATO International Military Staff\nLamas, Norfolk\nDr Sarah Kirchberger\nHead of Asia-Pacific strategy and security\nInstitute for Security Policy\nKiel University\nKiel, Germany\nProfessor Julian Lindley-French\nChairman \nAlphen Group\nAlphen, Netherlands \n\nCensoring \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d\nI appreciated Bagehot\u2019s article on self-censorship in British publishing, pegged to the editing of Roald Dahl\u2019s books for sensitivity (March 25th). The column noted that many publishers rejected George Orwell\u2019s anti-Soviet masterpiece, \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d, out of fear of giving offence. Yet it is worth remembering that more traditional censorship played a role as well. One publisher, Jonathan Cape, rejected the manuscript on the advice of Peter Smollett, an official at the British Ministry of Information. Smollett was later revealed to be a Soviet agent. What looks like self-censorship can have surprising, sometimes Orwellian, origins. \nJudge Glock\nAustin, Texas\n\nScience and religion\nMuch as I agree that science and religion need not be in conflict, I must cite a fascinating exception to Nicholas Spencer\u2019s claim that neuroscience stands little chance of \u201cfinding\u2026morality in an MRI scan\u201d (\u201cLeaps of faith\u201d, March 18th). Joshua Greene, Jonathan Cohen and others carried out an ingenious experiment using functional MRI which demonstrated that our inborn sense of right and wrong depends on particular circumstances (published in Science in 2001). \nUsing the hypothetical \u201crunaway trolley\u201d dilemma volunteers were asked about the morality of sacrificing one person to save many others. They gave contradictory answers depending on the context. If asked if it is moral to throw a switch so that a runaway trolley kills a few repairmen on the track to save a much larger number of passengers, the majority said yes. But if asked if it was moral to push one obese person onto the track to save the many the majority said no. The MRI scans showed that only the second scenario activated brain centres involved in emotions and moral choices.\nRichard Waugaman\nClinical professor of psychiatry\nGeorgetown University\nWashington, DC\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin is among the most important scientists to have tackled this problem. As both a scientist and a Jesuit, he showed how scientific theories, among them the Big Bang and Charles Darwin\u2019s work on evolution, could lead to the existence of God, and to another world for humanity. But he also wrote about the evidentiary irrelevance of some Christian dogmas, such as original sin. He used science to give a stronger basis for Christian faith. Needless to say some members of the Catholic church thought he was a heretic and some of his writings were not published until after his death in 1955.\nDenis Apvrille\nMember of the Association des Amis de Teilhard de Chardin\nLab\u00e8ge, France\n\nSubversive creativity\nI read your leader on the future of video games with a groan (\u201cStorm forming\u201d, March 25th). Video games have long been an escape for Western youth. For Generation Z they are an excuse to go wild, create fantasy lands, and be beyond the reach of parental supervision. The corporate push to consolidate and moderate content is another sign that the presence of \u201cthe man\u201d (our parents, anyone over the age of 35), is going to dampen the creative chaos and cathartic relief that video games provide.\nThe business successfully survived attempts in the 1990s and 2000s to censor games like \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d, in part because the game became a sign of teen rebellion and mostly because video-game developers did not have to pander to parents, who were not GTA\u2019s audience or the developer\u2019s market. Now that older generations have been co-opted into video gaming its rebellious nature will suffer as developers try to create games that appeal to little Johnny, Uncle Jimmy and all.\nKellen McGovern Jones\nFort Worth, Texas\n\nBarbie girls and boys\nSchumpeter should not be embarrassed by his excitement about \u201cBarbie\u201d (March 25th). It is eagerly awaited among cinephiles. I will watch it before Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d, which comes out the same day. We\u2019ve seen plenty of atomic bombs on the big screen; Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling playing toy dolls is uncharted territory.\nJames Jiang\nNew York\nIt\u2019s no small thing\nAs a man standing five feet and five inches I can assure you that height plays a significant part in a man\u2019s ability to find dates and partners (Graphic detail, March 25th). Ditto to being America\u2019s president. And probably everything in between. I am a married attorney, by the way. \nBRIAN SHEPPARD\nEncino, California", "description": "A selection of correspondence", "ogDescription": "A selection of correspondence", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230325_LDD001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-04-13T13:28:57Z", "dateModified": "2023-04-13T17:14:46Z", "dateCreated": "2023-04-13T11:13:26Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-04-15T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/llb6471jm4r2dht35vmqorh5osnl1h4e", "publication": [{"id": "/content/hoqoi9l5t7v1g3km772m1id3v2v1t0fr", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/kce3bhvhg57m3jji460h7ifn5tos1jt0", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r9of70si8af0nm5ocnmlbs4uin011d69", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g65alsp6875bu9ehhp4ve5fo64f1vf2r", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/hj1uq46tkevmcou02kk8g2f7rcdevps9", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/mou1gib3rmj4m8ov7esog93j33dfq1la", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/qahlng19apr0t51jsf0sc8gf62h1gcbi", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Letters to the editor", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/letters/2023/04/13/letters-to-the-editor", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
