The photograph seemed to serve Mr Podesta\u2019s idiosyncratic blend of fierce, almost monkish drive and wacky sense of humour. He kept it around to remind himself of what he called his biggest mistake: letting the leader of the free world cuddle a man-eating beast.\nMr Clinton is remembered for a certain appetite for risk in private life\u2014he just had to pat the damn tiger\u2014but for cautious, split-the-difference policymaking. Yet he wanted to be bold in the manner of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mr Clinton wound up sacrificing his plans to use government programmes  to create millions of middle-class jobs on the altar of deficit reduction. \u201cI hope you\u2019re all aware we\u2019re all Eisenhower Republicans,\u201d he fumed to Mr Podesta and other staff in 1993, according to \u201cThe Agenda\u201d, a book by Bob Woodward. \u201cWe\u2019re Eisenhower Republicans here, and we\u2019re fighting the Reagan Republicans. We stand for lower deficits and free trade and the bond market. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d\nThe next Democratic president, who was the next Mr Podesta would serve, found himself in the same straitjacket. Barack Obama got his health-care plan, but he probably never fulfilled his promise to create 5m \u201cgreen jobs\u201d to bolster the middle class. Yet no one can be sure, because not only did that programme succumb to budget cuts\u2014so did the programme to count such jobs.  \nNow Mr Podesta is serving a third Democratic president. But this time he is not shrinking the president\u2019s ambitions, and his own, to fit a straitened consensus about government\u2019s role. Instead, Mr Podesta is out to  transform America\u2019s energy economy by implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, which he calls \u201cthe largest climate and clean-energy bill passed in the history of the United States\u2014and, I think it\u2019s fair to say, probably the largest ever passed in the history of the world.\u201d The legislation commits $369bn to investment in incentives and grants over ten years, more than twice the $150bn Mr Obama hoped to spend but was not able to. It comes on top of two other giant interventions in the economy, the laws to rebuild infrastructure and to support the semiconductor industry.\n\u201cI think the world has changed,\u201d Mr. Podesta says, simply, when asked whether an ideological change in the party, or a change in the political context, has freed Joe Biden to intervene so mightily in the economy. Both parties failed to pay enough attention to industrial strategy, he says, leaving America too dependent on supply chains running through China and other authoritarian states. Facing up to the climate crisis had become inescapable. And Americans \u201chad grown sceptical about the fact that the government had an economic strategy that was about them\u201d. Mr Biden, he says, was able to braid these strands together. It is surprising that of the three presidents, Mr Biden, an instinctive centrist and legislative dealmaker, would get the chance to reach for Roosevelt\u2019s mantle. But, then, he has always been an artist of the possible. \u201cWho he is, and what he thinks, and what his experiences have been, met the moment,\u201d Mr Podesta says.\nAt 74 Mr Podesta is one of the Democrats\u2019 most expert policymakers and scarred political warriors. His roots reach below today\u2019s bicoastal, elitist Democratic Party to its populist springs: he grew up in Chicago, son of a factory worker who finished one year of high school. He became a lawyer and worked on Capitol Hill for years. He founded and ran the Centre for American Progress (cap), a liberal think-tank, before returning to government under Mr Obama. He ran Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed campaign in 2016, then returned to the CAP before Mr Biden brought him back once again. He calls himself \u201ca bad boxer who\u2019s just too dumb to fall down\u201d. \nRepublicans view Mr Podesta as a ruthless partisan and the climate spending as a fat target for investigation. That is a playbook Mr Podesta knows, and it seems far down his list of worries. Nor is he much concerned Republicans will legislate to undermine the climate law itself. New projects are already under way, as the renewable-energy industry begins investing against the legislation\u2019s ten-year horizon. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a fire-breathing Republican representative from Georgia, may have called global warming healthy for the planet, but she has celebrated the new jobs coming to a solar plant in her district. \u201cThis is going to get rooted and be very hard to uproot,\u201d Mr Podesta predicts. \nThe tiger by the tail\nHe seems far more worried by how such projects will find workers at a time when the American construction industry says hundreds of thousands of jobs are already going unfilled. The law provides a bonus to companies that use certified apprentices, which may prompt businesses to work with unions to train women and minorities who might not otherwise have a shot at the new jobs. \nAnother headache for Mr Podesta was the failure of a bill to streamline the process for getting permits for clean energy. That has left state and local governments with tremendous blocking authority. Thousands of projects are awaiting permission to plug into America\u2019s dozens of electricity networks, which are not robust enough to accommodate all the new sources of power. In his first week on the job, Mr Podesta sat down with the secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, and reviewed each major project to identify bottlenecks. At the White House and within the cabinet, Mr Biden\u2019s top officials are committed to hitting deadlines project by project. \u201cThat has not traditionally been a political priority,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that beats management.\u201d\nGenerations of Democrats have longed for the chance Mr Biden has seized, to prove government can be a potent force for good in the lives of all Americans. From atop a neglected if not abused bureaucracy, he may have about two years to get that job done. \u25a0\nRead more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics:\nBut on the right and left,
