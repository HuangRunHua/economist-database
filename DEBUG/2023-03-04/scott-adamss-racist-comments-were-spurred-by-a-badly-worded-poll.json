The comic originated as a satire of the white-collar office, and poked fun at mismanaging bosses and time-wasting meetings. But in recent years Scott Adams, the creator of the oddly shaped bespectacled office worker, has drawn strips on corporate diversity quotas and whether people should be able to choose their pronouns. On February 22nd Mr Adams appeared in a YouTube live-stream in which he called black Americans a hate group and advised white people to \u201cget the hell away\u201d from them. The partner publications of \u201cDilbert\u201d quickly condemned Mr Adams and announced they would stop publishing the comic.\nLike the office workers he satirised, Mr Adams\u2019s career suicide was partly down to abusing data. His source appears to be a poll from Rasmussen Reports, which according to Mr Adams showed that \u201cnearly half\u201d of African-Americans are \u201cnot OK\u201d with white people. \u201cThat\u2019s a hate group,\u201d Mr Adams said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have anything to do with them.\u201d \nThe comic-creator\u2019s comments misconstrue two numbers from the poll, however\u2014and the survey itself is confusing. The poll, which Rasmussen released on February 22nd, asked Americans whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be white\u201d. Seventy-two per cent agreed with this, and 12% disagreed. \nRasmussen was quick to highlight an outlier group: 53% of black Americans said it is \u201cOK to be white\u201d, while 26% disagreed. In addition, 21% of black adults said they were \u201cnot sure\u201d how they felt. Mr Adams appears to have added the last group to the share disagreeing that it\u2019s acceptable to be white. (In the video, Mr Adams says he has been \u201cidentifying as black for years now\u201d because he likes \u201cto be on the winning team\u201d.)\nMany respondents were probably confused by the bizarre question, stuck into a survey that also asked about Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating and whether respondents believed they had suffered \u201cmajor side effects\u201d from covid-19 vaccines. Indeed, 17% of respondents said they were \u201cnot sure\u201d how they felt on the race question. According to Matthew Graham, a scholar of survey research, the higher-than-average share of undecided respondents indicates the question is poorly understood not just by those who answered \u201cnot sure\u201d, but by those who gave an answer, too. It is possible that some people simply said they disagreed with the question because they were not themselves white, for example.\n\nSocial scientists tend to ask people how they feel about racial groups using a \u201cfeeling thermometer\u201d scale. That is where a respondent ranks a group on a scale of \u201ccoldly\u201d to \u201cwarmly\u201d from 0 to 100. According to The Economist\u2019s analysis of such data from the American National Election Studies, a quadrennial academic survey, 60% of black Americans in 2020 rated whites warmly (at least a 51 out of 100). Meanwhile 67% of whites rated \u201cblacks\u201d warmly. Until recently, black Americans felt more warmly towards whites than vice versa. That changed in 2016 (see chart).\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, the statement \u201cit\u2019s OK to be white\u201d was created by white supremacists on 4chan, a message-board site, as a way to provoke progressives into condemning the statement\u2014proving how unreasonable they were being. A non-partisan pollster would probably have avoided asking such a question. \nMark Mitchell, Rasmussen\u2019s head pollster, defended the survey against the \u201chaters\u201d and \u201canti-polling troglodytes\u201d questioning his methods. He says that the firm is asking reasonable questions that \u201cthe media\u201d is not covering; that he knows what America \u201creally thinks\u201d and it\u2019s not what\u2019s being reported by the news. Perhaps what Rasmussen Reports is really after is attention. If so, it got what it wanted.\u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that
