They wrap around the big-bellied pots just beneath their rims, as if anticipating their fullness once packed with cured meats, lard or pickled cucumbers. The verses that appear on some of the 40 surviving \u201cpoem jars\u201d are joyful, even humorous. \u201cWhen you fill this jar with pork or beef\u201d, reads one, \u201cScot will be there; to get a peace.\u201d Keep circling around the brown jars, and near the potter-poet\u2019s signature\u2014\u201cDave\u201d\u2014he has etched the initials \u201cLm\u201d. These stand for Lewis Miles, his enslaver.\nMiles\u2019s pottery business was one of many that flourished in the clay-rich area of Edgefield, South Carolina, between 1810 and 1880. They used slave labour to dig clay, mix glazes and chop and lug wood to fire kilns\u2014but also for the highly skilled work of turning pots on the wheel. The fact that early American stoneware is bound up with industrial slavery, a lesser-known model than the agricultural kind, may be news to visitors at a major exhibition of David Drake\u2019s jars. Twelve feature in a show of pre-civil war ceramics that began at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York last autumn and opens in March at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. \nDrake is remarkable for several reasons. He is the only enslaved potter with a known body of work. South Carolina outlawed literacy for African-Americans in 1834. Yet he wrote on his pieces\u2014including a jar on which he cut one word, \u201cConcatination\u201d, which scholars think refers to the state of being chained. Several of his poems are, in this way, doubly subversive. \u201cNineteen days before Christmas Eve\u201d, Drake inscribed on another jar; \u201cLots of people, after its over, how they will greave.\u201d That is a reference to the practice of selling or leasing slaves on New Year\u2019s Day to settle debts, which split up families.\nSuch vessels, some as large as 40 gallons (150 litres), were produced to store rationed food for enslaved workers on local plantations. That context imbues the exuberance and optimism of Drake\u2019s poems with defiance. His dexterity as a potter is clear: no one else in Edgefield made jars so big. He combined the techniques of wheel-throwing and coiling, and experimented with glazes to produce varying textures and colours, from moss green to ochre.\nA decade ago Drake\u2019s work was relatively unknown, but recognition has come swiftly. In 2021 a 25-gallon jar he made sold at auction for more than $1.5m\u2014the highest-ever price for American pottery and almost double the previous record, set by a teapot made by John Bartlam, a white potter who produced America\u2019s first porcelain in South Carolina\u2019s potteries. When the Met acquired the jar that refers to \u201cScot\u201d in 2020, its director said the addition was \u201ctruly transformative\u201d for the museum\u2019s American collection.\nIn a sign of museums\u2019 surging interest in African-American artistry, a second show of a 19th-century black potter\u2019s work opened this winter at the New-York Historical Society. It is the first dedicated to Thomas Commeraw. Like Drake, Commeraw made thousands of functional pots, of which 22 are on display. He worked in New York, another centre of American stoneware production, near plentiful clay beds in New Jersey and Long Island. But unlike Drake, Commeraw was free. He spoke out about the unequal treatment of the city\u2019s black residents, petitioning the state legislature to incorporate a black mutual-aid society that he helped establish. \nThe Met acquired a Commeraw pot over a century ago, though for years he was assumed to be a white potter of European descent. His glossy grey vessels, salt-glazed and decorated in blue with cobalt oxide, followed a style imported by German potters. Among the first of those were the Crolius family who enslaved Commeraw and his parents. Only in 2003 did an auction house discover from a 19th-century census that Commeraw was black. Freed as a child, he was the only black master-potter in New York in the early 1800s. He owned his home and workshop, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. Few white potters did so then.\nBy 1810 six in seven black New Yorkers were free, a rapid shift from two decades earlier when a majority were slaves. But slavery was not abolished in the city until 1827, and discrimination was rife. Trade societies excluded black artisans. So Commeraw traded with the harbour\u2019s black oystermen, who dominated that brisk business and needed jars in which to hawk their oysters\u2014all the rage among New Yorkers, who ate them fried, pickled and raw. He also sold his wares to middle-class homes and upscale boarding houses: jars for preserving plums, quince and molasses, jugs for cider, kegs and butter churns.\nResearch into Drake and Commeraw is ongoing; some artefacts were found only recently, including a jar by Commeraw that came to light in 2013 during water-mains works in Manhattan. The Drake show is rounded out by pieces made by five black artists working today. One of them, Adebunmi Gbadebo, uses indigo dye, Carolina Gold rice, black human hair and clay dug from the plantation where her ancestors were enslaved. The result is a startling series of works examining land and memory in the American South. As these shows demonstrate, there is still much more history to unearth. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly
