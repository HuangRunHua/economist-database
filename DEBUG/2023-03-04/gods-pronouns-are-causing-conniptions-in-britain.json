He said: \u201cI am the LORD.\u201d He said: \u201cI am\u2026the Almighty.\u201d He said: \u201cI am Alpha and Omega.\u201d However perhaps because He tended to communicate by angels, divine inspiration and stone tablets, rather than by email with sign-off, He did not specify His pronouns. Now an argument is brewing among some in the Church of England (c of e) over whether He is indeed best referred to as He/Him or whether He might also be referred to as She/Her; or neither; or all of the above. Omnipotence allows the non-binary to be so much more expansive.\nNot to mention confusing. All debates over pronouns risk becoming befuddling; debates over which pronouns to use for a bodiless, sexless, omnipresent deity who exists beyond time can become more befuddling still. Naturally this does not prevent theologians from having them. While C of E traditionalists wish to keep Him as Him, some want additional liturgy to be developed to allow them to speak of God in a non-gendered way. The debate is unlikely to be resolved soon: the C of E officially began discussing this in 2014; will begin a joint project on gendered language this spring; and estimates it will be years before it is resolved. Sub specie aeternitatis, that is brisk: Anglicans began discussing transubstantiation 500 years ago and the issue is still not settled.  \nSex and God are currently causing conniptions in other ways in Britain. When Kate Forbes, a Scottish politician and Christian, said that she would have voted against gay marriage, it resulted in the near-scuppering of her bid to be the leader of the Scottish National Party. In February, when the C of E  said it would start allowing the blessing of gay marriages in churches, that resulted in a split in the Anglican Communion (a club of churches) and\u2014a sure sign of Anglican outrage\u2014merciless declarations from bishops worldwide that they were praying for each other. \nBoth debates tend to make traditionalists chunter about woke nonsense. (Vladimir Putin is among those who disapprove.) In truth what is most striking about the debate over God\u2019s sex is its antiquity. Christians have been discussing God\u2019s sex for centuries in ways that make LGBTQI+ categories seem conservative. There are ancient texts in which the Holy Spirit is referred to as \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d and others in which God has breasts which are milked by the Holy Spirit. Sexing a Trinity is tricky.\nBoth sides of these debates tend to turn to the Bible as an authority. Not without reason: the Bible is the inspired word of God. The problem is that God inspired quite a lot of words\u2014modern editions run to 1,000-odd pages in a tiny font\u2014and many of them disagree either with each other or with current Christian doctrine.\nAnglicans today might argue that God is neither male nor female. But the Bible offers ample evidence to the contrary. In its pages, God is a \u201cmale and masculine\u201d deity, says Francesca Stavrakopoulou, professor of Hebrew Bible at Exeter University. The Bible contains verses detailing everything from God\u2019s muscles (big); to his genitals (also large). But those verses tend to find their way into fewer C of E press releases. \nIn truth, Christians have long operated a pious pick\u2019n\u2019mix approach to their quarrels. \u201cThe issue du jour is homosexuality,\u201d says Diarmaid MacCulloch, emeritus professor of the history of the church at Oxford University. But this issue is \u201ca new one, which seems to threaten the masculinity of a great many Anglican bishops worldwide.\u201d Such debates invoke antiquity but are often more revealing of modernity. A concept called politicomorphism argues that instead of things being done on earth as in heaven, often the reverse is true. Many of the bishops who split from the Anglican Communion come from conservative countries such as Sudan, in which homosexuality is illegal. \nBut all Christians have their limits. Anglicans are in mild-mannered disarray over which pronoun to use for God, yet arguably there is a word that solves their debate perfectly. The pronoun \u201cthey\u201d is not only gender neutral but can also, much like a trinitarian God, simultaneously be both singular and plural. However its use in the singular is frowned on by the fuddy-duddy sort of grammarian and, as one Christian theologian observes, \u201cChristian theology has probably not caught up with [its] modern use.\u201d Evidently there are some innovations that even Anglicans can\u2019t abide. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "description": "Anglicans are debating whether He should be He/Him or She/Her or something else.
