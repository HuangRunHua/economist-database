Extending the EU to Ukraine or the western Balkans would boost the figure, and the region\u2019s importance. But this is far from imminent, despite central Europe\u2019s persistent calls.\n\nThe group\u2019s economic weight has been rising, with living standards gradually closing the gap with western Europe. The need for Europe to repatriate some supply chains from China could give it further heft. But a lack of financial integration\u2014Poland is not in the euro\u2014somewhat limits its clout there, too. And all nine Bucharest countries get more from the EU budget than they pay in. In practice, that lowers their influence.\nPoland and some of its allies also fail to punch their weight diplomatically. Small countries like Denmark and Ireland, and even some bigger ones like the Netherlands, can make up for their size by carefully crafting alliances and generating new ideas for the EU. Poland, notably, is not interested in this. \u201cOn any topic other than Ukraine, they don\u2019t even pretend to care,\u201d says one EU diplomat.\nThe conservative coalition in Warsaw, which has been in power since 2015, is often out of step with the more liberal consensus that reigns in Europe, for example on abortion or gay rights. That, and the rule-of-law saga, limits the appetite of many EU members to ally enduringly with Poland. An attempt at regularly including it in Franco-German deliberations, as one point in the so-called Weimar Triangle, has largely fizzled. \nAnd virulent German-bashing by the ruling coalition is a recurring feature of Polish political discourse, which will only increase ahead of elections in the autumn. It includes a poorly thought-through demand for reparations for the second world war to the tune of  \u20ac1.3trn ($1.4trn)\u2014an amount so absurd that Germany has been able to shrug it off. \nFrance, for its part, is frustrated that the Bucharest club shows little interest in bolstering the EU\u2019s \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d, for example by increasing domestic arms production. Poland and the Baltics see NATO, and thus America, as the guarantor of their borders instead; it helps that NATO, a defence alliance, does not lecture them about internal matters like the situation of the courts. Poland\u2019s aggressive stance towards Germany might change if the pro-European liberal opposition wins in the autumn. Poland\u2019s suspicions about French machinations will not.\nCountries in the EU gain influence through their ability and willingness to solve the continent\u2019s common problems. That requires a shared understanding of what those problems are. Poland and its allies will continue to be heard while the focus of Europe and the world is on what is happening near its borders. What happens after that is less clear. \u25a0\nRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Tilting east",

Yet when Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz arrives in Washington for talks with Joe Biden on March 3rd, it might not even count as the American president\u2019s most important contact with Europe that fortnight. During a trip to Poland last week, Mr Biden met leaders of the EU\u2019s eastern fringe, heaping praise on them for their help with the war in Ukraine, from which he had just returned. The sense that the war has rejigged the map of who matters in Europe was palpable.\nThe countries on the eastern fringe of the EU feel their time has come. In their telling, a tectonic shift to the east is taking place. Power is rapidly seeping from the \u201cold Europe\u201d\u2014delegitimised by having been so wrong for so long about Russia\u2014in favour of countries now bearing the brunt of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression. The war is an opportunity for fresh thinking and new leadership. \u201cThis is an existential moment for Europe as a whole,\u201d says Pawel Jablonski, a Polish deputy foreign minister. With Ukraine now a candidate to be part of the club one day, some dream that a new axis between Warsaw and Kyiv could provide a counterweight to the one between Paris and Berlin.\nNot so fast. That the mood in European circles has shifted is in no doubt. That it will translate into enduringly more influence for countries such as Poland, the biggest of the \u201cBucharest Nine\u201d, is far less certain. (The Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and the three Baltic states joined the EU together with Poland in 2004, followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007.) The region has wasted opportunities for a greater EU leadership role before. \n\nEven western Europeans accept that this is central Europe\u2019s moment. Warnings from former Soviet satellites about the risk of relying on Russia for gas used to be treated in Germany as over-anxious; now they are accepted as having been prescient. There is widespread admiration for the manner in which central European countries have taken in millions of Ukrainians fleeing war. The region\u2019s armouries have been drained to succour Ukraine\u2014the first batch of Leopard tanks from Poland has just been delivered\u2014and lots of new military kit ordered. \nAll this has given central Europe a measure of moral leadership\u2014and a louder voice than ever at the EU table. \u201cWe always listened to them,\u201d says one western European diplomat. \u201cNow perhaps we listen a little more.\u201d But the message from the east is not necessarily getting through. \nOne reason is a differing emphasis on the extent of the security threat. For Poland and other frontline states the threat from Russia is unlikely to abate soon. Leaders in the region have long said that Mr Putin\u2019s imperialist ambitions would turn to them one day. \u201cAs long as Putin is in power, even if there is a truce in Ukraine, we assume it will be a pause in fighting, not a settlement,\u201d says Justyna Gotkowska of OSW, a think-tank in Warsaw.\nWestern Europe, on the whole, tends to feel rather differently. Of course, Ukraine matters a great deal there as well: many billions are being spent on aiding the country, EU members\u2019 armed forces are being upgraded and the war has roiled the continent\u2019s economy. Finland is among those that share the security concerns of Poles and Lithuanians; hence its imminent joining of NATO. \nBut seen from Brussels, Dublin or Paris, life goes on despite the war. Energy systems have been rewired. The EU has faced lots of challenges in the past decade, whether around the euro zone, migration or Brexit. It will face more in coming years, no doubt. Ukraine is but one of them. While it is not quite business as usual, there is no reason to overthrow the old EU regime\u2014the one in which central Europe has far less importance. \n\nWhen EU leaders meet in Brussels, the focus is no longer just on Ukraine. Just as important is the manner in which Europe should react to a resurgence in illegal migration, say, or respond to America\u2019s green subsidies (the latter will come up during Mr Scholz\u2019s visit). This is baffling central Europeans, who can feel Mr Putin breathing down their necks. To them, discussing anything other than Ukraine is to underestimate\u2014again!\u2014the threat posed by Russia. Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland\u2019s prime minister, has spoken of the job he has to do to \u201cwake up\u201d the rest of Europe.\nThe life-goes-on approach is bad news for his country in particular. Poland might well hope that its starring role in the war would help resolve a long-standing row with the EU. The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, has accused it of flouting basic principles of the rule of law. In its view, the government is packing courts with politicised judges, and seeking to undermine the primacy of EU law. This has proved a costly exercise: Poland is yet to get \u20ac35bn ($37bn) in grants and loans linked to a pandemic-era recovery fund.  \nClout and charm\nSeasoned Brussels hands point to other reasons for the region\u2019s lack of weight. Influence in the EU stems from population size and economic heft. Failing that, clever diplomatic footwork can help. In none of these areas does central Europe stand out. \nStart with size. Taken together, the Bucharest Nine have a population of 95m, around a fifth of the EU total; their combined GDP is only about a tenth of the EU\u2019s total at market rates. Only one, Poland, counts as a big member state. Nor are they unified. Hungary is currently a pariah, given how its autocratic leader Viktor Orban has stood by Russia. More broadly, only in some fields are the interests of Romania aligned with those of Estonia, or those of Slovakia with Bulgaria. Extending the EU to Ukraine or the western Balkans would boost the figure, and the region\u2019s importance. But this is far from imminent, despite central Europe\u2019s persistent calls.\n\nThe group\u2019s economic weight has been rising, with living standards gradually closing the gap with western Europe. The need for Europe to repatriate some supply chains from China could give it further heft. But a lack of financial integration\u2014Poland is not in the euro\u2014somewhat limits its clout there, too. And all nine Bucharest countries get more from the EU budget than they pay in. In practice, that lowers their influence.\nPoland and some of its allies also fail to punch their weight diplomatically. Small countries like Denmark and Ireland, and even some bigger ones like the Netherlands, can make up for their size by carefully crafting alliances and generating new ideas for the EU. Poland, notably, is not interested in this. \u201cOn any topic other than Ukraine, they don\u2019t even pretend to care,\u201d says one EU diplomat.\nThe conservative coalition in Warsaw, which has been in power since 2015, is often out of step with the more liberal consensus that reigns in Europe, for example on abortion or gay rights. That, and the rule-of-law saga, limits the appetite of many EU members to ally enduringly with Poland. An attempt at regularly including it in Franco-German deliberations, as one point in the so-called Weimar Triangle, has largely fizzled. \nAnd virulent German-bashing by the ruling coalition is a recurring feature of Polish political discourse, which will only increase ahead of elections in the autumn. It includes a poorly thought-through demand for reparations for the second world war to the tune of  \u20ac1.3trn ($1.4trn)\u2014an amount so absurd that Germany has been able to shrug it off. \nFrance, for its part, is frustrated that the Bucharest club shows little interest in bolstering the EU\u2019s \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d, for example by increasing domestic arms production. Poland and the Baltics see NATO, and thus America, as the guarantor of their borders instead; it helps that NATO, a defence alliance, does not lecture them about internal matters like the situation of the courts. Poland\u2019s aggressive stance towards Germany might change if the pro-European liberal opposition wins in the autumn. Poland\u2019s suspicions about French machinations will not.\nCountries in the EU gain influence through their ability and willingness to solve the continent\u2019s common problems. That requires a shared understanding of what those problems are. Poland and its allies will continue to be heard while the focus of Europe and the world is on what is happening near its borders. What happens after that is less clear. \u25a0\nRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war", "description": "But will the EU\u2019s new balance of influence endure?", "ogDescription": "But
