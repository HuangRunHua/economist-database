But the talkfest was a modest success. China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping met Joe Biden for the first time in person since he had become America\u2019s president. The 20-member club issued a joint statement (the most debated paragraph, about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, declared that most members condemned the war). Can Indonesia work the same magic as the new chair of the ten-member Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)?\nThe region could use some leadership. In the past two years Myanmar\u2019s civil war is estimated to have cost 30,000 lives and displaced 2m people. China continues to bully its South-East Asian neighbours in the South China Sea. And ASEAN has struggled to exude the sense of purpose of the Pacific\u2019s newer groupings, including the Quad, an initiative of America, Australia, India and Japan, and aUKUS, consisting of America, Australia and Britain. \nIndonesia\u2019s year-long turn at the helm should at least give asean more prominence. The country is the region\u2019s biggest economy and asean\u2019s so-called \u201cfirst among equals\u201d. Under President Joko Widodo, Indonesia, long a bystander in world affairs, has also exerted itself a bit more abroad. Jokowi, as the president is known, is a fan of \u201cdown to earth\u201d diplomacy, which mainly translates as prioritising Indonesia\u2019s economic advantage.\nAccording to Rizal Sukma, a former Indonesian ambassador to Britain, the country\u2019s diplomats are given three orders: to boost exports, foreign investment and tourism. The slogan of Indonesia\u2019s Asean leadership is \u201cepicentrum of growth\u201d.\nYet that approach does not promise much action against China\u2019s regional aggression. Jokowi\u2019s signature economic policy is to extract more value from Indonesia\u2019s rich mineral deposits. And no country is contributing more to that effort than China, which has invested billions of dollars into helping Indonesia process its nickel reserves, among the world\u2019s largest. This has sometimes caused frictions within Indonesia. Chinese and Indonesian workers have come to blows at some Chinese projects. A China-backed high-speed rail project is running over deadline and budget. Still, Chinese investment of over $8bn in Indonesia in 2022 is a powerful reason for Jokowi not to push back at China to anything like the degree that some asean members and America (which invested $3bn) would like him to.\nThe president is mainly concerned to protect Indonesian waters from Chinese maritime aggression. With that in mind, Indonesia recently signed a deal with Vietnam to demarcate their exclusive economic zones, which the two countries had previously contested. Jokowi is additionally keen to defend Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty against China around the Natunas, east of Singapore. Though China does not claim the Indonesian islands directly, the \u201cnine-dash-line\u201d it has drawn around nearly the entire South China Sea bisects their waters.\nYet though this is an issue that affects most of Asean\u2018s members, Jokowi is not likely to rally them on it. In truth, he appears to have no particular ambitions for Indonesia\u2019s ASEAN helmsmanship beyond attracting more investment and trade.\nHis attitude toward Myanmar\u2019s ruling junta will be a test of this. Last year ASEAN banned the generals from attending its meetings, pending progress on a notional peace plan, which would include a cessation of violence and the appointment of a regional envoy to the war-torn country. Myanmar has not implemented the plan. And ASEAN is split on how to respond.\nThailand tried to negotiate with the junta in December, through an unofficial dialogue which was boycotted by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. Some ASEAN countries may argue that the election that the junta plans to hold in August should lead to a broader regional re-engagement. Jokowi has given conflicting signals. He says ASEAN will not be \u201cheld hostage\u201d by the junta; also that Indonesia will send a general to Myanmar to hold talks. This does not augur a serious effort to end the country\u2019s misery.\nIndonesia is meanwhile gearing up for a presidential election due in February 2024. After two terms in office, Jokowi is not running for re-election. But the domestic issues that will dominate the campaign could still bleed into his foreign policy, one way or another. Fresh conflict between Chinese and Indonesian workers might put pressure on the president to push back on Chinese aggression a little harder. Or, perhaps more likely, it may persuade him to make his thorny regional leadership role even less of a priority than he otherwise would. \u25a0", "description": "Joko Widodo, Indonesia\u2019s
