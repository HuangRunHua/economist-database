David Solomon, its chief executive, raised the possibility of selling parts of its lossmaking consumer services after it has finished scaling back the division. It has become clear \u201cthat we lacked certain competitive advantages\u201d in the business, he said. Markets were left unimpressed by the presentation. Goldman\u2019s share price fell after the event.   \nTesla held its first ever investor day, at which Elon Musk outlined part three of his \u201cMaster Plan\u201d for the company. Senior executives also took part and said an electric car for the mass market was in the works, which is essential for Tesla\u2019s sales ambitions. But the lack of detail about the new model disappointed investors. \nTesla also confirmed that it is building its first factory in Mexico, in Monterrey. It is the latest carmaker to invest in making electric vehicles in Mexico; in February BMW said it would expand production and build a factory to assemble batteries. Mexico is benefiting from the huge green subsidies in America\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, $34bn of which is earmarked for smoothing the supply chain for EVs. \nThe euro zone\u2019s annual inflation rate remained virtually unchanged in February at 8.5%, though the reading was higher than the 8.2% that economists had expected.  Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, increased to 5.6%. Inflation also rose in the currency bloc\u2019s two biggest economies, Germany and France, adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to continue raising interest rates. \nA measure of factory activity in China grew at its fastest rate in a decade, suggesting that the economy is bouncing back from covid-19 lockdowns and other restrictions. The official purchasing managers\u2019 index for manufacturing registered 52.6 for February, up from 50.1 in January (a reading over 50 means manufacturing is growing). The news triggered a rally in Hong Kong\u2019s stockmarket. \nAmerica\u2019s three main stockmarkets declined in February. The S&P 500 was down by 2.6% and the NASDAQ composite by 1.1%. Both indices are still up for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 4.2% in February; it has dropped by over 1% so far this year. \nSorting out the greenwashing\nThe European Commission announced that an agreement had been reached on its proposed standard for EU green bonds. Companies that want to promote their bonds as climate-friendly will have to ensure that the investments meet strict sustainability requirements. It is not yet clear what the penalties will be if companies\u2019 bonds don\u2019t meet the new standards. \nSweden\u2019s economy shrank by 0.9% in the last three months of 2022 compared with the previous quarter. The country is expected to fall into recession this year as soaring prices and higher interest rates knock consumer spending. House prices are falling sharply. Finland\u2019s economy did fall into recession in the fourth quarter, contracting by 0.6% after a 0.1% decline in the third quarter. \nAn accounting charge on stock-based compensation caused Zoom to report its first quarterly loss since 2018. The video-conference company\u2019s revenue grew by just 4%, year on year. A year earlier sales were still growing by 20%. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe share price of Beyond Meat fell back, having rallied after it produced better forecasts for the year than expected. Its stock is up by 38% since the start of 2023, even though revenue fell by 20% in the fourth quarter, year on year, and it made another net loss. Sales for the alternative-meat industry were butchered last year, in part because fake meat hasn\u2019t lived up to the hype of being as tasty as the real thing. \nOcado reported another big annual loss. Revenue from its online-groceries business in Britain fell. It had more customers but they put fewer items in their baskets: 46 on average, down from 52 in 2021. \nInternational Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, made its first annual operating profit since the start of the pandemic: \u20ac1.3bn ($1.4bn). Passenger revenue soared to \u20ac19.5bn from \u20ac5.8bn in 2021. IAG expects profit to climb. \nCome fly with me\nCathay Pacific began giving away free return flights to Hong Kong to residents of South-East Asia as part of the city\u2019s campaign to lure back tourists after lockdown. The government is making 500,000 tickets available. Cathay is providing 80,000. Hong Kong\u2019s main airline has had a turbulent few years, from being ensnared in pro-democracy politics to coming close to collapse amid  covid restrictions. But business is taking off again. Cathay flew 1m passengers in January, up by 4,000%, year on year.", "description": "", "ogDescription": "", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230304_WWP501.jpg",
