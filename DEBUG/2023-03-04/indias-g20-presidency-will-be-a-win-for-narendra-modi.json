Roundabouts, historic monuments and airports are plastered with posters displaying its logo, a green-and-saffron rendering of \u201cG20\u201d. The \u201c0\u201d is represented by a globe cradled within a flowering lotus. It looks like the insignia of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Images of Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, are in close attendance, gazing benignly down.\nThe advertising blitz reflects the Modi government\u2019s ambition for India\u2019s year-long turn at the wheel of the 20-member club\u2014which started last week with a meeting of finance ministers in Bangalore. India wants to promote the G20, whose members account for 85% of the world\u2019s gDP, as a forum for solving big problems. As the self-styled \u201cVoice of the Global South\u201d, it especially wants to stress the importance of powerful developing countries in that effort. Perhaps above all, it wants to use the G20 as a stage for Mr Modi to show off the strides India has made to visiting bigwigs and, with a general election due next year, also to Indian voters.\nThe official agenda for India\u2019s G20 presidency emphasises the demands of poor countries: for inclusive growth, climate finance, more \u201crepresentative\u201d multilateral institutions and progress on the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, which has been set back by the fallout from covid-19. \u201cIndia will probably never get the permanent seat on the UN Security Council that it wants, so it\u2019s trying to work through other forums,\u201d says Mohan Kumar, a former Indian ambassador to France who leads research on the G20 at the Jindal School of International Affairs, near Delhi.\nHow realistic are these ambitions? In some ways, geopolitics is working in Mr Modi\u2019s favour. Western governments also want India to play a bigger global role. They view it as a potential bridge to the developing world, as Joe Biden implied last week by nominating Ajay Banga, an India-born American citizen and former ceo of Mastercard, to head the World Bank. They also see it as a democratic counterweight to China (notwithstanding the bjp\u2019s anti-democratic harassing of its domestic critics). On a visit to India last week, Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, said he was \u201cconvinced that our countries are closely linked, that we have common views, especially when it has to do with democracy\u201d.\nIndia\u2019s G20 presidency seems sure to win the country many more such plaudits. Yet it seems unlikely to inspire much progress towards its goals. An informal grouping with no charter and no secretariat, the G20 relies on consensus among its members to get things done. Formed in 1999 in the wake of the Asian financial crisis as a more inclusive forum to discuss economic co-operation than the G8 (now G7) of rich industrialised countries, it achieved its one standout success in April 2009, when its members, fearing an impending depression, agreed on measures to stabilise global financial markets. These days they are not comparably united on any issue.\nAnyway, thanks for coming\u2026\nThe club is divided by several geopolitical faultlines. America and some of its allies are embroiled in an economic and ideological conflict with China. They are also supplying Ukraine with money and weapons while slapping sanctions on Russia. Some poor and middle-income countries, including India, also worry about China. But when it comes to Ukraine, they, with India again to the fore, are mainly concerned about the damaging effect of Western sanctions on food and energy security and on their public finances.\nThere is little to suggest India will make a serious effort to bridge such gaps. Forging consensus requires horse-trading and compromise, neither of which is prominent in Indian foreign policy. It elevates the pursuit of narrow self-interest, issue by issue and never mind the contradictions, to the level of doctrine. For example, even as India is deepening its ties with America and its many pro-India allies, Mr Modi\u2019s government is playing to its domestic supporters by accusing the same countries of pushing an \u201canti-India\u201d agenda.\nIn an interview last week Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India\u2019s razor-sharp foreign minister, suggested a BBC documentary critical of Mr Modi\u2019s role during a bloody pogrom against Muslims in his native state of Gujarat was an attack on India by foreign powers. \u201cThere is a phrase called \u2018war by other means\u2019. This is politics by other means\u2026I don\u2019t know if election season has started in India, but for sure it has started in London and New York,\u201d he said. India\u2019s Western admirers are to a great extent willing to overlook such nonsense. Still, grandstanding and paranoia are not conducive to global leadership.\nThe G20\u2019s divisions over Ukraine helped ensure the gathering of finance ministers in Bangalore achieved little. The representatives of China and Russia refused to sign a painfully non-judgmental statement on the war and its economic consequences that India had pre-cooked; it stressed the existence of \u201cother views and different assessments of the situation\u201d. Ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers in Delhi this week, Russia accused the West of \u201cdestabilising\u201d the G20 by using \u201cblackmail\u201d to impose an anti-Russian \u201cdiktat\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming difficult for the G20 to engage in constructive discussion because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine,\u201d Japan\u2019s finance minister, Suzuki Shunichi, told reporters in Bangalore.\nRestructuring sovereign debt is also a sticking-point, says Heribert Dieter of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, in Berlin. \u201cChina has made it clear it will not participate in restructuring, and Western countries will not accept haircuts only for the money to be spent on paying China back.\u201d So is another Indian priority, climate finance, which has been stymied by Western countries\u2019 failure to honour long-standing undertakings on the issue, even as developing countries pile up additional demands for compensatory \u201closs and damage\u201d payments. The G20 looks extremely unlikely to reach consensus, let alone take action, on any significant item on India\u2019s agenda.\nIt will burnish Mr Modi, though. Over the course of the year, cities across India, all decorated in G20 and Modi paraphernalia, will host foreign delegates at some 200 meetings. The slogan of India\u2019s presidency is: \u201cVasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u201d, or \u201cOne Earth, One Family, One Future\u201d. And one leader, an Indian observer might add. \u25a0", "description": "But a summit this week will expose bitter global divisions", "ogDescription": "But a summit this week will expose bitter global
