By Tim Alberta. Harper; 496 pages; $35\nThis chronicle of the modern evangelical movement in America is a horror story told from the inside. Its author, a staff writer for the Atlantic, is angry and heartbroken as he watches the religious community in which he was brought up being hijacked by power-hungry hucksters and right-wing nationalists. \nSome People Need Killing. By Patricia Evangelista. Random House; 448 pages; $30. Grove Press; \u00a320\nA rigorously reported look at Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s campaign against illegal drugs from a Filipina journalist.
