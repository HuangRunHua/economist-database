her Instagram feed for the first time in two and half years. The former activist (pictured) was jailed in 2020 for taking part in pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong a year earlier. Upon her release on bail in 2021, national-security agents in the city confiscated her passport. She is still under investigation. On Instagram she said that she lived in fear, avoiding politics and struggling with anxiety and depression.\nShe also outlined the extraordinary steps that the authorities in Hong Kong took in an effort to change her views. She was forced to write a letter expressing regret for her actions and vowing not to contact other activists. In August five agents escorted her to Shenzhen, a city in mainland China. They took her to an exhibit touting the country\u2019s achievements since it began to reform its economy. She was made to pose for photographs at the headquarters of Tencent, a technology giant. In the end, she had to write a thank-you letter to the police for showing her \u201cthe motherland\u2019s great development\u201d. \nMs Chow had to do all that in order to get her passport back. Earlier this year she was accepted into a master\u2019s programme in Canada. In September, a day before she was due to leave, the document was returned to her. Now in Toronto, she has decided not to go back to Hong Kong, perhaps for the rest of her life. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be forced into doing things against my will any more,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cMy body and spirit will collapse.\u201d\nAs the story of Ms Chow shows, the police and officials in Hong Kong are adopting tools often used on the mainland to control residents. These range from forced confessions and so-called \u201cpatriotic tours\u201d to re-education campaigns in prisons. Young people are a particular target. Even as the city tries to woo back tourists and businesses under the banner of \u201cHappy Hong Kong\u201d, its leaders are planning to expand the use of such tactics.\nOfficials in Hong Kong have condemned Ms Chow for jumping bail. \u201cFugitives will be pursued for life unless they turn themselves in,\u201d said John Lee, the city\u2019s chief executive. He added that Ms Chow is a \u201cliar\u201d and a \u201chypocrite\u201d who is suspected of \u201ccollusion with foreign forces to endanger national security\u201d, a vague charge often used to punish activists. Those foreign forces are still trying to infiltrate Hong Kong, said Mr Lee, so the local government intends to enact new security-related measures next year. Article 23 of Hong Kong\u2019s constitution, the Basic Law, mandates the government to form such legislation, but public opposition has delayed the task until now.\nRadical measures\nIn order to control people like Ms Chow the government has also developed what it calls a \u201cderadicalisation\u201d programme. This usually takes place in prison. According to officials, hundreds of detainees have taken part. Most were protesters. A young participant called Tsang Chi-kin was recently interviewed for a television series sponsored by Hong Kong\u2019s police. Shot during a pro-democracy protest in 2019 and later arrested, Mr Tsang said the programme taught him to manage his emotions. \u201cWe must think clearly before acting to avoid being incited and instigated by others.\u201d\nThe programme involves meeting a psychologist, studying Chinese history and culture, and attending career-planning sessions. One government video shows detainees playing the drums. They perform a song called \u201cChinese People\u201d. \u201cI am proud to be Chinese,\u201d says a detainee. \u201cChinese drums were invented by us Chinese people. I feel very accomplished to be a part of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d\nHong Kong officials seem to think the deradicalisation programme is working. There have been no big protests since 2019. But the pandemic and China\u2019s broader crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong are the main reasons for that. Released detainees say they resent the attempted \u201cbrainwashing\u201d. Such coercive methods are good for one thing, though: pushing young people like Ms Chow away. \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world
