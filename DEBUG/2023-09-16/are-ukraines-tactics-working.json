Their solution was smaller, nimbler and well-drilled \u201cstorm troopers\u201d who could cross enemy lines and grab territory, with heavier units moving up later. \u201cSince Ukraine doesn\u2019t have the ability to use air power on any kind of relevant scale, it makes total sense to solve the problem the way it was solved before air power matured,\u201d says Mr Friedman. Many European officers acknowledge that their own better trained and equipped armies would struggle to break the Surovikin line.\nFighting about fighting\nAmerican officials are not well placed to offer lessons on tactical best practice, says Mr Friedman. The bulk of their recent experience of combat has been in mountainous or desert areas where small units cannot take advantage of cover to advance in this way. The two main training centres for America\u2019s ground forces, the army\u2019s site at Fort Irwin and the marines\u2019 location at Twentynine Palms, are both in Californian desert environments, he points out. \u201cUS forces have very little experience facing anything like what Ukraine is facing, whether in combat or in training.\u201d\nThe problem is: nor does Ukraine. Mr Watling and Mr Reynolds argue that attrition of officers and the dramatic expansion of Ukraine\u2019s army over the past 18 months mean that it lacks sufficient junior leaders with expertise in offensive operations. The result, they say, is that decisions are thrown up to more senior officers, overwhelming brigade headquarters that already have a lot on their plate. \n\nThey give the example of a Ukrainian attack on the village of Rivnopil in Donetsk province earlier in the summer. Attackers are supposed to release smoke to cover their movement and confuse the enemy. But only 3% of Ukraine\u2019s artillery-fire missions involved smoke\u2014in part because senior commanders did not want to obscure their own view of the battle from drones circling overhead. The lesson is that Ukraine needs more junior officers who can be trusted to take the initiative even when their bosses cannot watch from afar. \nThe quality of training is important, too. Western training facilities are hobbled by a \u201csafety culture in NATO\u201d, argue Mr Watling and Mr Reynolds. Drones are central to Ukraine\u2019s tactics, allowing artillery units to spot targets and infantry to perform reconnaissance. Yet most NATO training areas impose tight restrictions on when and how drones may be flown, for fear they will veer off course. Safety rules also mean that artillery skills are typically taught later in courses. But in Ukraine \u201ctroops who are not prepared to deal with artillery are not prepared for the fight,\u201d write the RUSI analysts. Europe\u2019s health and safety rules are not a good fit for a war of national survival.\nMost of these issues will not be resolved during the current counter-offensive. Ukraine will eventually need to reintroduce mechanised and armoured forces if it is to exploit any breakthroughs. That could get easier: minefields are less dense beyond the first line of defence. It is thought to have enough ammunition to fight through the autumn. But on September 10th Mark Milley, America\u2019s top general, said that Ukraine probably had 30 to 45 days of combat left before rain and mud would make it too difficult for vehicles to advance. \nIn recent weeks Ukraine has made faster progress in the south by piercing the first of Russia\u2019s three defensive lines in Zaporizhia around the village of Robotyne, widening the resulting salient by pressing east to Verbove and then attacking  towards the village of Novoprokopivka (see map). On September 13th it struck with missiles a shipyard in Crimea used by Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, setting vessels ablaze. Russia has had to commit reserves from its 76th air assault division; but it has been able to because Ukraine threw in its own in August.\nIt is not clear how much fresh manpower either side has left. Rates of attrition appear to favour Ukraine over Russia, but sources suggest that Russia can probably still scrape together enough reserves to plug holes. \u201cUnless there is a collapse of Russian lines, the battles we have seen for the past three months are the ones we will likely continue to see over the next few months,\u201d concludes Mr Muzyka, who argues that only the deployment of larger formations, beyond Ukraine\u2019s capacity, would speed things up. Dozens of Western officials consulted by The Economist are also sceptical that a major breakthrough will come before winter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to extend our timeline,\u201d says one of them. \u201cThis could be a very long struggle.\u201d \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Are Ukraine\u2019s tactics working?", "section": {"url":

"articleBody": "Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\n\nDMYTRO KULEBA, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, is a smooth and affable diplomat, unruffled by the trickiest questions. But on August 31st his patience snapped. \u201cCriticising the slow pace of the counter-offensive equals\u2026spitting into the face of the Ukrainian soldier who sacrifices his life every day,\u201d he told journalists. \u201cI would recommend all critics to shut up, come to Ukraine and try to liberate one square centimetre by themselves.\u201d That outburst was prompted by weeks of stories in the American press, in which anonymous officials took issue with Ukraine\u2019s slow progress on the battlefield and questioned its military tactics. The row is unseemly. But is Ukraine\u2019s approach working?\nAllied debates over strategy are hardly unusual. American and British officials worked closely with Ukraine in the months before it launched its counter-offensive in June. They gave intelligence and advice, conducted detailed war games to simulate how different attacks might play out, and helped design and train the brigades that received the lion\u2019s share of Western equipment. Even so, Ukraine\u2014stung by a big leak of American intelligence documents unearthed in April\u2014kept its own counsel. It delayed the start of the offensive and held plans close to its chest. \nOne big point of contention was Ukraine\u2019s earlier decision, over the first half of the year, to keep fighting for Bakhmut, a town in the eastern Donbas region that has limited strategic significance but became a symbol of resistance. Ukraine\u2019s decision to defend the town at all costs had a \u201cbig influence\u201d on the subsequent counter-offensive, argues Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, a firm that tracks the war. Ukraine burned through its stockpile of shells while Russia gained time to build up its formidable defences in the south\u2014the so-called Surovikin line, named after a now-fired Russian general. \nQuarrels persisted even after the counter-offensive began. American officials had encouraged Ukraine to concentrate its forces on the main axis of attack in the south, towards the Sea of Azov. Instead Ukraine split its forces with the aim of stretching the Russians over a longer front. The most experienced brigades, armed mostly with older gear, were kept in Bakhmut, where they are making modest progress on the town\u2019s flanks. One source  says that politics is playing an unhelpful role in military strategy, with well-connected brigades around Bakhmut getting a larger share of scarce ammunition than military considerations alone might warrant. \nMeanwhile Ukraine deployed less experienced brigades on the more important southern axis, armed with newer kit. They quickly became bogged down in dense minefields covered by Russian artillery, drones and helicopters. Untested commanders made a series of mistakes, such as running into friendly mines and mistiming attacks. \u201cIf more experienced Ukrainian brigades were given the new equipment, they may not have committed many of the errors the new brigades made,\u201d write Michael Kofman and Rob Lee, both experts on Russia\u2019s armed forces, in an essay for War on the Rocks, an online journal. \nSome blame for early missteps lies with those who helped plan the counter-offensive. In a recent paper Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think-tank in London, argue that the assault relied in part on outdated assumptions that did not take into account the threat from new sorts of sensors and drones. They conclude: \u201cMuch of the data supporting the tactics that Ukraine\u2019s international partners sought to train Ukrainian forces to adopt was based on operational analysis from the 20th century that did not contend with a range of technologies employed in Ukraine.\u201d Russian fortifications were also far more substantial than Western planners assumed. \nWherever the fault lies, it is clear that something went wrong. \u201cIt seems that Kyiv had no contingency plans that could be quickly implemented in case the attack stalled,\u201d notes Mr Muzyka. Eventually Ukrainian commanders decided to hold back their heavy armour and switch to a simpler approach. Groups of sappers, often crawling on their bellies, now clear minefields by hand. Platoons and companies, rather than brigades, fight tree line to tree line, advancing on foot so as to present a smaller target. This has helped limit losses of men and equipment, but allows only 700 to 1,200 metres of progress every five days, notes the RUSI paper, giving Russian troops time to \u201creset\u201d their defences (the rate may have picked up a little of late).\nThat leads to two debates. One is whether Ukrainian commanders have been too risk-averse. Some Western officials argue that if Ukraine had stuck with bolder and larger-scale attacks, as planned, they would have taken higher casualties at first but had more luck breaking through Russian lines, shortening the offensive and reducing the overall toll. Ukrainian officials retort that this would only have led to more bloodshed, and that officers could not expect a heavily depleted citizen army to mimic Russian human-wave attacks. \nA second debate is whether Ukraine should emulate a Western way of war or carve out its own path. Western armed forces prize the idea of combined-arms manoeuvre, in which armoured forces synchronise their movement with infantry, artillery, air defence and (increasingly) electronic and cyber-attacks. The five weeks of pre-offensive training given to Ukrainian troops in Germany was not nearly enough to make them proficient in this sort of warfare.\n\u201cThe Ukrainians are still tied to Soviet doctrine,\u201d complains an American official. Heavy artillery barrages, in place of more judicious and precise attacks, are one source of tension, not least because America is playing the lead role in sourcing ammunition for Ukrainian guns. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time for their mindset\u2026and tactics to change,\u201d says the official. \nIn fact the Ukrainian approach is fit for purpose, says B.A. Friedman, a retired artillery officer in the US Marine Corps and author of a book on military tactics. In the spring of 1918, after years of stalemate on the western front of the first world war, the German army realised that large units were too vulnerable to artillery fire. Their solution was smaller, nimbler and well-drilled \u201cstorm troopers\u201d who could cross enemy lines and grab territory, with heavier units moving up later. \u201cSince Ukraine doesn\u2019t have the ability to use air power on any kind of relevant scale, it makes total sense to solve the problem the way it was solved before air power matured,\u201d says Mr Friedman. Many European officers acknowledge that their own better trained and equipped armies would struggle to break the Surovikin line.\nFighting about fighting\nAmerican officials are not well placed to offer lessons on tactical best practice, says Mr Friedman. The bulk of their recent experience of combat has been in mountainous or desert areas where small units cannot take advantage of cover to advance in this way. The two main training centres for America\u2019s ground forces, the army\u2019s site at Fort Irwin and the marines\u2019 location at Twentynine Palms, are both in Californian desert environments, he points out. \u201cUS forces have very little experience facing anything like what Ukraine is facing, whether in combat or in training.\u201d\nThe problem is: nor does Ukraine. Mr Watling and Mr Reynolds argue that attrition of officers and the dramatic expansion of Ukraine\u2019s army over the past 18 months mean that it lacks sufficient junior leaders with expertise in offensive operations. The result, they say, is that decisions are thrown up to more senior officers, overwhelming brigade headquarters that already have a lot on their plate. \n\nThey give the example of a Ukrainian attack on the village of Rivnopil in Donetsk province earlier in the summer. Attackers are supposed to release smoke to cover their movement and confuse the enemy. But only 3% of Ukraine\u2019s artillery-fire missions involved smoke\u2014in part because senior commanders did not want to obscure their own view of the battle from drones circling overhead. The lesson is that Ukraine needs more junior officers who can be trusted to take the initiative even when their bosses cannot watch from afar. \nThe quality of training is important, too. Western training facilities are hobbled by a \u201csafety culture in NATO\u201d, argue Mr Watling and Mr Reynolds. Drones are central to Ukraine\u2019s tactics, allowing artillery units to spot targets and infantry to perform reconnaissance. Yet most NATO training areas impose tight restrictions on when and how drones may be flown, for fear they will veer off course. Safety rules also mean that artillery skills are typically taught later in courses. But in Ukraine \u201ctroops who are not prepared to deal with artillery are not prepared for the fight,\u201d write the RUSI analysts. Europe\u2019s health and safety rules are not a good fit for a war of national survival.\nMost of these issues will not be resolved during the current counter-offensive. Ukraine will eventually need to reintroduce mechanised and armoured forces if it is to exploit any breakthroughs. That could get easier: minefields are less dense beyond the first line of defence. It is thought to have enough ammunition to fight through the autumn. But on September 10th Mark Milley, America\u2019s top general, said that Ukraine probably had 30 to 45 days of combat left before rain and mud would make it too difficult for vehicles to advance. \nIn recent weeks Ukraine has made faster progress in the south by piercing the first of Russia\u2019s three defensive lines in Zaporizhia around the village of Robotyne, widening the resulting salient by pressing east to Verbove and then attacking  towards the village of Novoprokopivka (see map). On September 13th it struck with missiles a shipyard in Crimea used by Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, setting vessels ablaze. Russia has had to commit reserves from its 76th air assault division; but it has been able to because Ukraine threw in its own in August.\nIt is not clear how much fresh manpower either side has left. Rates of attrition appear to favour Ukraine over Russia, but sources suggest that Russia can probably still scrape together enough reserves to plug holes. \u201cUnless there is a collapse of Russian lines, the battles we have seen for the past three months are the ones we will likely continue to see over the next few months,\u201d concludes Mr Muzyka, who argues that only the deployment of larger formations, beyond Ukraine\u2019s capacity, would speed things up. Dozens of Western officials consulted by The Economist are also sceptical that a major breakthrough will come before winter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to extend our timeline,\u201d says one of them. \u201cThis could be a very long struggle.\u201d \u25a0", "description": "Slow progress on the battlefield prompts quarrels over strategy", "ogDescription": "Slow progress on the battlefield prompts quarrels over strategy", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230916_IRP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-09-12T17:29:33Z", "dateModified": "2023-09-14T11:55:21Z", "dateCreated": "2023-09-12T17:29:03Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-09-16T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "Kyiv and Washington, DC", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/hds9rt1nj2on31lqke4u2ne9h76ulktt", "publication": [{"id": "/content/gucrc008ntvkmmigk294c8o88eeftlcb", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r9b9qloc688n26f6c6rnks7vqp9ipe2o", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/uvbnv4g3924v3sfeerdvucjcbhvfkd9v", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4988b1i62ub7fheabvgvng0bh53p5drn", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ntoktkt3mm18unj88g6l01nsa6kqu1fr", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/08rmn1bgdmacrm6k6rbqchqir7cre6jc", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/289bqaauqa2pp3csoebrj224p605vs2l", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/l18s9gdd8upm1gjhop94ch0vd643ksvh", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Are Ukraine\u2019s tactics working?", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/12/are-ukraines-tactics-working", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
