"https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/14/apple-is-only-the-latest-casualty-of-the-sino-american-tech-war", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Few events in the tech calendar create as much buzz as the release of the latest iPhone. On September 12th Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s boss, unveiled what he called \u201ctruly incredible\u201d new devices. Yet it was an earlier, quieter launch of a rival gadget that left the tech world gobsmacked. In late August, with no forewarning, Huawei showed off the Mate 60 Pro. As the first fully Chinese-made smartphone that can tap into 5G networks, it was an instant hit. The processors inside it were made by SMIC, China\u2019s chipmaking champion. It is exactly this type of technology that America has been trying to stop Huawei and other Chinese companies from getting their hands on. \nIf being upstaged by a Chinese rival was not enough to sour Apple\u2019s mood, days later news broke that some Chinese government departments and state-owned firms may be banning iPhones. The American giant\u2019s share price fell by 6%, wiping around $200bn from its market value. \nA ban\u2019s direct impact on Apple would be minimal. A tiny fraction of China\u2019s 7m or so public servants can afford iPhones, reckons Jefferies, an investment bank. Still, the rumours\u2014and they are still that\u2014signal that not even Apple, whose relations with China have long been cosy, is invulnerable to geopolitics. What is more, China\u2019s targeting of America\u2019s most valuable company, combined with SMIC\u2019s newfound chipmaking prowess, may provoke hawks in Washington to tighten anti-Chinese controls. The Chinese may respond, and so on up the escalation ladder. No wonder investors are spooked.\nSo far the tit-for-tat has rocked semiconductor firms the most. Last year America restricted exports to China of advanced chips and the tools to make them. Nvidia, a specialist in processors for artificial intelligence (AI) whose market value surpassed $1trn this year, said that trade controls will cut its quarterly revenue by 6%. Tighter controls could hurt its sales of data-centre AI chips. Between 20% and 25% of these go to China. In August Nvidia said that America\u2019s government was controlling exports of its most advanced AI chips to the Middle East, possibly to prevent Chinese firms from procuring them there. \nThe chipmakers have also suffered from Chinese retaliation. In May China barred memory chips made by Micron from certain infrastructure projects. The Idaho-based company said this could cut annual revenue by more than 10%. Talk of the Apple ban has pulled down the share prices of the iPhone-maker\u2019s American chip suppliers, such as Cirrus, Qualcomm and Skyworks. Chinese regulators have also been dragging out the approval of big American acquisitions, points out Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein, a broker. As a result, in early August Intel, another chipmaker, gave up its attempt to buy Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli firm, for $5.4bn.\nThe situation of American makers of chipmaking tools is more mixed. LAM Research and Applied Materials, two such firms, each warned last year of a $2bn hit to sales in 2023, equivalent to around 10% of revenue. But some of that may be offset by rising sales of equipment used in manufacturing less advanced semiconductors. American companies can keep selling these to China, which is stockpiling them while it still can. According to New Street Research, a firm of analysts, Chinese purchases of such tools have increased roughly four-fold between 2019 and 2023. \nFurther escalation may bruise America\u2019s tech giants, and not just Apple. According to the Wall Street Journal, President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is considering curbing China\u2019s access to American cloud computing. That would bring Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft into the firing line.\nThe biggest losers were, in American eyes, meant to be Huawei, SMIC and China\u2019s other tech titans. They have certainly suffered. But today they are taking advantage of the techno-nationalism that is a byproduct of the geopolitical strife. Huawei\u2019s share of domestic smartphone sales grew from 7% to 13% in the year to the second quarter of 2023, reckons IDC, a research firm. The new 5G device, which sold out in two days, may boost it further\u2014as would an iPhone ban. Huawei also benefits from SMIC\u2019s efforts to innovate around the American controls. In the week after the Mate 60 Pro\u2019s launch, meanwhile, the chipmaker\u2019s share price jumped by 10%. Not quite what the China hawks in Washington had in mind. \u25a0\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",
