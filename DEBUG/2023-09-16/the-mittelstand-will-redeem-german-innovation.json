"Article", "articleBody": "TALK TO GERMAN bosses these days and sooner or later one will bring up \u201cBuddenbrooks\u201d. Thomas Mann\u2019s epic tale of the eponymous clan of grain merchants and their demise is required reading in Germany\u2019s business circles, as well as its schools. Today it serves as a convenient metaphor for the country\u2019s perceived economic decline. GDP may contract this year. Inflation remains stubbornly high. The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party is second in some opinion polls, imperilling Germany\u2019s reputation for openness to skilled foreigners. Iconic companies are fleeing abroad. bASF, the world\u2019s largest chemicals firm, is building its $10bn state-of-the-art factory in China. Linde, an industrial-gas group, delisted from the stock exchange in Frankfurt to escape its cumbersome rules but kept its listing in New York. BioNTech, which helped develop one of the world\u2019s first covid-19 vaccines, is setting up its cancer-research operations in Britain. \nViewed through a tragic Buddenbrookian lens, German decline can seem inevitable. Not to Nicola Leibinger-Kamm\u00fcller, chief executive of Trumpf, a 100-year-old family company based in Ditzingen, near Stuttgart, which makes industrial tools such as laser cutters and punching machines. In Mrs Leibinger-Kamm\u00fcller\u2019s reading, the Buddenbrooks\u2019 downfall was not caused by others. They brought it on themselves, by turning their backs on the virtues of thrift and hard work. That leaves a path to redemption. And this, she believes, runs through the Mittelstand, the German economy\u2019s enterprising backbone.\nThe Mittelstand is home to some 3.5m small and medium-sized businesses. They are as diverse as their wares, which range from chainsaws to industrial software. Some are large and old: Trumpf has 17,000 employees worldwide and annual revenues of \u20ac5.4bn ($5.8bn). Others are small and young, like TeamViewer, an 18-year-old computer-maintenance firm with 1,400 employees, or Marvel Fusion, a nuclear-fusion startup founded in 2019. Despite this diversity, they share two important things in common. They are relentlessly innovative. And, not unrelatedly, their leaders are, like Mrs Leibinger-Kamm\u00fcller, less gloomy about Germany\u2019s prospects than many of their blue-chip counterparts.\nMore than 80% of Mittelstand firms say their situation is stable or good, according to a survey in July by the zGV, an alliance of such businesses. The mood is not rosy, exactly: half reported that sales were down in the second quarter. But it is hopeful. The Mittelstand continues to hire and invest at home. In July Trumpf announced a \u20ac380m investment into its headquarters. \u201cPeople said we have gone mad,\u201d recounts Mrs Leibinger-Kamm\u00fcller.\nIn fact, Trumpf is coldly rational. \u201cThe current wave of pessimism is vastly overdone,\u201d says Holger Schmieding, chief economist of Berenberg, a private bank. Germany enjoys record employment and low public debt. Most of all, he says, it has in the Mittelstand \u201cone of the best search engines for innovation ever invented\u201d. These \u201chidden champions\u201d, world leaders in their market niche, have coped with painful transitions before, such as the aftermath of German reunification in the 1990s. Now they are adapting again, be it to higher energy prices or to chillier relations with China, which has become a large market for the Mittelstand\u2019s products but is itself looking economically enfeebled and geopolitically adversarial. \nTrumpf spends 11% of revenue on research and development, almost twice the average for German industry as a whole. It is constantly comparing notes with clients to tailor its products to their changing needs. It has worked with one client to develop a way of using lasers to cut metal more directly from the coil, which uses less of the newly costly energy than the conventional method of cutting it from sheets. Karl Haeusgen, chairman of Hawe, a maker of hydraulic pumps, says that conversations with domestic customers are his firm\u2019s principal source of innovation. \u201cOur Chinese clients will buy what we have, but our German customers challenge our creativity,\u201d he says. \nOliver Steil, chief executive of TeamViewer, agrees that the Mittelstand contains some of Germany\u2019s most agile and innovative firms. They benefit from closeness to German industrial titans, to which they often act as suppliers, and from the country\u2019s deep pool of technological and engineering know-how. Most important in times of change, they are risk-takers, says Mr Steil. Undaunted by the old saw that fusion power is 20 years away and always will be, Marvel Fusion is intent on developing commercially viable power generation by smashing atoms together using lasers.\nIf there is a Buddenbrook in the latest chapter of the Mittelstand story, it is the German government.

In March the Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation pledged \u20ac90m to support laser-based fusion in Germany, half of which will go to Marvel. At a recent pow-wow in Schloss Meseberg, a castle near Berlin, the government unveiled a \u201cgrowth opportunities law\u201d.
