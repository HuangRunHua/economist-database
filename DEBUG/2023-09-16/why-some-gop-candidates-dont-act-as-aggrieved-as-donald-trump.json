"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/14/why-some-gop-candidates-dont-act-as-aggrieved-as-donald-trump", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "One of Donald Trump\u2019s signature political achievements, which like most of them owes to his genius for shamelessness, has been to convert self-pity from a Republican vice into a virtue. He has likewise turned claims of victimhood inside out, from confessions of weakness into boasts. \u201cI am a victim,\u201d Mr Trump declared twice in announcing his present bid for the presidency. He has called one source of his suffering \u201cthe greatest witch hunt in the history of our country\u201d, and another, simply, \u201ca lynching\u201d. It may be the only Trump whine he has ever managed to sell, but, as he exhorts his supporters to feel sorry for themselves and to rage at their oppressors, and presents himself as their persecuted billionaire champion, they gulp it all down.\nAs effective as this Trumpian theme has been, one category of Republican politician seems particularly reluctant to adopt it: non-white ones. \u201cNo more whining,\u201d Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and a daughter of immigrants from India, likes to instruct voters. \u201cNo more complaining. Now we get to work.\u201d Vivek Ramaswamy, a former entrepreneur whose parents also immigrated from India, published a book called \u201cNation of Victims\u201d in which he regrets that, for Americans of whatever race or ideology, thinking of themselves as victims is \u201cone of the few things we\u2019ve all got left in common\u201d.\nTim Scott, a Republican senator from South Carolina, is campaigning for the Republican nomination on the most classic version of the party\u2019s faith. His America has not become a shadowland in which a heartless, fanged establishment sucks the life out of everyone else. It remains, instead, a sunny upland welcoming anyone with the grit to haul themselves up to it by their bootstraps. \u201cI am so proud to be an American,\u201d Mr Scott said recently at a gathering of voters in Rye, New Hampshire, rendering the word \u201cproud\u201d in a hushed, reverent tone. \u201cI am running for president because I know America can do for anyone what she\u2019s done for me.\u201d\nMr Scott, who is 57, is an effective evangelist for this vision because he can present himself as proof. He speaks of growing up the son of a single mother who worked 16 hours a day as a nurse\u2019s assistant, changing bedpans. \u201cIt was not a glorious job,\u201d he said in Rye. \u201cBut she took pride in helping people. She took pride in going to work.\u201d He describes how his mother encouraged him in his studies\u2014\u201cshoot for the moon,\u201d she would say, because \u201ceven if you miss you\u2019ll be among the stars\u201d\u2014in order to tee up an emotional high point of his coming-of-age tale: the scene when, after he failed freshman year of high school, she had him choose a branch from a tree outside their home for her to beat him with. \nHard work, stern discipline, overcoming obstacles: for his audiences, each theme of Mr Scott\u2019s story derives more power from the fact that he is black. When Mr Scott gave the Republican response to a speech by President Joe Biden to Congress two years ago, \u201cUncle Tim\u201d trended, repulsively, on Twitter. But Mr Scott does not deny the persistence of American bigotry. He has spoken of being pulled over repeatedly by police and even barred from entering the Capitol until white colleagues affirmed his credentials. \nYet Mr Scott, an adherent of motivational speakers, tells voters that he has also \u201cbeen the beneficiary of good people from every community\u201d and has learned to treat racism as another obstacle to be overcome, even to turn it into a source of strength. \u201cToday we are teaching kids how to be victims,\u201d he warned in Rye. \u201cYou never escape victimhood. It comes with the drug of despair.\u201d\nWhite crowds in Iowa and New Hampshire hang on Mr Scott\u2019s words. Donors have poured money into his campaign. As of mid-August, Mr Scott had outspent all other Republican candidates on advertising, according to the Washington Post. A super PAC, Trust in the Mission, is spending tens of millions of dollars more on advertising to promote him. Yet as of mid-September Mr Scott was far back in the crowd, stuck in single digits in national polls and statewide polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. \nRepublican voters and operatives fault Mr Scott for not being more forceful in the first Republican debate, on August 23rd. As the other candidates attacked each other, Mr Scott hung back. No doubt, to gain attention, he needed to join the fray. But to do so would conflict with his politics and even his upbringing. \u201cFor all of my life and for all of my family\u2019s heritage, we had tried to avoid being confrontational,\u201d Mr Scott writes in his memoir, \u201cOpportunity Knocks\u201d. \u201cAlways, we believed, the primary aim should be to find common ground.\u201d Mr Scott may not be able to overcome the handicap of his own inspirational politics. Republican voters may be comforted by his message about America\u2019s fundamental fairness to its non-white citizens, but many of them thrill to Mr Trump\u2019s warnings that they themselves are being screwed.\nWhite man\u2019s burden\nAt the gathering in Rye, one elderly white man introduced his question by saying he had hoped Barack Obama, as president, would \u201cturn the corner on racism\u201d, but that he had failed to do so. He wondered how Mr Scott would accomplish this. What a heavy burden some Americans place on black politicians, asking them not only to smilingly bear the wounds of their own encounters with racism but to relieve white people of having to worry that racism remains a curse. Mr Scott seemed momentarily taken aback, and resorted to condemning socialism. Then he found his way back to his safe theme, that his achievements confirmed \u201cwe live in a nation where the colour of your skin does not determine the outcome of your life.\u201d\nIt says good things about America, and about the Republican Party, that so many non-white Republican candidates\u2014five of a dozen\u2014are competing this year for the nomination. How sad that an even clearer sign of progress will come when they feel entitled to the same privilege as white candidates: to publicly pity themselves, and campaign on their grievances. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.
