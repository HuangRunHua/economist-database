Conspiracy Theories. By Mike Rothschild. Melville House; 336 pages; $32.50 and \u00a330\nBrutal wildfires ravaged Maui in August, killing at least 115 people. Some conspiracy theorists claimed that the fires were caused by energy beamed from satellites, reviving an idea advanced in an online post from 2018 that attributed Californian wildfires to \u201cspace solar generators\u201d. The author, Marjorie Taylor Greene (pictured), speculated about the novel technology\u2019s backers, including a company she identified as \u201cRothschild Inc\u201d. \nWhen Ms Greene wrote those words she was a conservative activist and gym owner, but her past pronouncements faced closer scrutiny when she was, improbably, elected to Congress in 2020. Her  screed, later described as a rant about \u201cJewish space lasers\u201d (a phrase she had not in fact used), drew mockery. It also led to accusations of anti-Semitism, in response to which she insisted that she \u201cdidn\u2019t find out until recently that the Rothschilds were Jewish\u201d.\nMike Rothschild is an American journalist with no connections to the Rothschild family he writes about. \u201cThis is the biography of an idea,\u201d he explains, \u201cand it\u2019s a simple enough one: that Jews control everything, and that the Rothschilds are the \u2018Kings of the Jews\u2019.\u201d \nAfter giving a potted history of the Rothschild banking dynasty that began with Mayer Amschel Rothschild, born in Frankfurt\u2019s Jewish ghetto in 1744, he then highlights conspiracy theorists\u2019 twisted, alternative version. This portrays the Rothschilds as puppet-masters who engineered the American civil war and hired Charles Darwin to invent the theory of evolution so they could promote a godless one-world government. They now supposedly control 80% of global wealth and run sperm banks to expand their bloodline. For reasons not wholly unrelated to his surname, the author is keen to discredit such preposterous notions. (A branch of the Rothschild family owns a stake in The Economist. Make of that what you will.)\nMr Rothschild has immersed himself in anti-Semitic propaganda. Familiar examples include \u201cThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion\u201d, a forgery published in Russia in 1903 that purports to be a Jewish blueprint for world domination, and Eustace Mullins\u2019s anti-Rothschild volume \u201cThe Secrets of the Federal Reserve\u201d (1952). The latter was among the 39 English-language books found on the shelves of Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound when American special forces tracked him down and killed him in 2011. \nIn 1846 Mathieu Georges Dairnvaell, a Frenchman, published a hostile pamphlet after a fatal rail crash on a line owned by James de Rothschild, Mayer Amschel\u2019s youngest son. Dairnvaell attributed the crash to the Rothschilds\u2019 penny-pinching neglect of passenger safety and linked it to the family\u2019s financial gains following the Battle of Waterloo, arguing that \u201cthey have enriched themselves with our impoverishment and our disasters.\u201d (The Rothschilds probably made money from early knowledge of the outcome of Waterloo but did not cause the rail accident.) Dairnvaell\u2019s pamphlet about these \u201cvampires of commerce\u201d is now obscure, but its reach has been long. An inheritor of Dairnvaell\u2019s bile is Alex Jones, a right-wing radio host. The Rothschilds have been mentioned in more than 1,300 episodes of his podcast.\nMr Rothschild\u2019s trawl through libels and canards risks repetitiveness, but he illustrates how and why conspiracy theories spread. They begin with a paranoid aversion to official accounts of events and an eagerness to see causation where there is only correlation; they burgeon because they tap into what terrifies or enrages people, especially those who feel powerless. They travel quickly when they lend themselves to gossipy soundbites, sick humour and tasteless online memes. Like a never-ending laser show, they captivate people and distract them from reality. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly
