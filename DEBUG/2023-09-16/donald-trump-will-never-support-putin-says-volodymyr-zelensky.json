war\n\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKY does not want to think about a long war, let alone talk about the possibility to Ukrainians, many of whom still dream of winning fast. But that is what he is preparing for. \u201cI have to be ready, my team has to be ready for the long war, and emotionally I am ready,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president says in an interview with The Economist. Speaking on the margins of the YES conference, an international pow-wow in Kyiv, he is composed and sombre. At the same setting a year ago, the mood was euphoric; news of Ukrainian forces\u2019 success in pushing Russia back from the Kharkiv region was pinging on every smartphone in the room. \nThis year, the atmosphere is very different. Three months into its counter-offensive, Ukraine has made only modest progress along the all-important southern axis in the Zaporizhia region, where it is trying to sever Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cland bridge\u201d from Russia to Crimea. The questions of how long that will take, and whether it will succeed, weigh on the minds of Western leaders. They still talk the good talk, pledging that they will stand with Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d. But Mr Zelensky, a former TV actor with a keen sense of his audience, has detected a change of mood among some of his partners.  \u201cI have this intuition, reading, hearing and seeing their eyes [when they say] \u2018we\u2019ll be always with you,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I see that he or she is not here, not with us.\u201d Some partners might see Ukraine\u2019s recent difficulties on the battlefield as a reason to force it into negotiations with Russia. But \u201cthis is a bad moment, since Putin sees the same.\u201d\n\nHaving failed to overwhelm Ukraine quickly, Mr Putin seems determined to exhaust the country and to wear out its partners\u2019 resolve to keep funding and supplying it with arms. He aims to make Ukraine a dysfunctional, depopulated state whose refugees cause problems in Europe. But Mr Zelensky says Russia itself is fragile. Mr Putin \u201cdoes not understand that in the long war, he will lose. Because it does not matter that 60% or 70% [of Russians] support him. No, his economy will lose.\u201d As Ukraine increases its strikes inside Russia, Russians will start asking awkward questions about their army\u2019s inability to protect them, \u201cbecause our drones will land\u201d. \nAt the same time, Ukraine\u2019s president is aware of the risks to his country if the West starts to withdraw its economic support. That would damage not just Ukraine\u2019s economy, but its war effort, too. He puts it in stark terms. \u201cIf you are not with Ukraine, you are with Russia, and if you are not with Russia, you are with Ukraine. And if partners do not help us, it means they will help Russia to win. That is it.\u201d \nUkraine\u2019s president has excelled at appealing to Western publics, often over the heads of their politicians. He still believes that the best way \u201cto convince governments, [to make them] believe they are on the right side, is by pushing them via the media. People read, people discuss, people make up their minds and people push,\u201d he says. It was public opinion that drove politicians to increase arms supplies to Ukraine in the early days of the war. Scaling down that help, he argues, may anger not just Ukrainians but Western voters. They will start asking what the whole effort was for. \u201cPeople will not forgive [their leaders] if they lose Ukraine.\u201d \nIf Mr Putin hopes that a win by Donald Trump in America\u2019s presidential election in 2024 would deliver him military victory, he is mistaken. Trump would \u201cnever\u201d support Vladimir Putin. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what strong Americans do.\u201d He expects Joe Biden will stay the course if he is re-elected. (\u201cDo they want Afghanistan, part two?\u201d) And he hopes that the European Union will not only keep supplying aid, but will open negotiations over the accession process for Ukraine this year. (That is widely expected to happen at a summit in December.) \u201cIt will support morale in Ukraine. It will give this energy to people.\u201d\nKeeping morale high is crucial. This is why, Mr Zelensky says, even limited progress on the front line is essential. \u201cNow we have movement. It\u2019s important.\u201d After heavy initial losses, and hastily adapted tactics, Ukrainian soldiers have finally pierced the first of Russia\u2019s three main defensive lines in the Zaporizhia region. A big breakthrough can still come, Mr Zelensky insists: \u201cIf we push them from the south, they will run.\u201d \nOn the counter-offensive\u2019s secondary front, near the eastern town of Bakhmut, Ukrainian forces are also slowly taking back territory. \u201cDuring the first days of the full-scale war, we kept being pushed back. Each day. They took some cities, hundreds of villages,\u201d he says. Now, Ukrainian forces are crawling forward. But troops face a Herculean task to turn advances along either axis into a strategic breakthrough. \nIn answer to Western complaints about the offensive\u2019s slowness, Mr Zelensky says it reflects the extreme level of danger. Winning back territory needs to be balanced with preserving as many lives as possible. Soldiers need to reduce the risks: to carry out reconnaissance, to use drones, to avoid direct clashes. Ukraine would have lost \u201cthousands\u201d had it followed advice to commit many more troops, he says. This is not the sort of war where \u201cthe leader of a country says the price doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d That is the difference between him and Vladimir Putin. \u201cFor him, life is nothing.\u201d \nAfter months of building up expectations for the counter-offensive, Mr Zelensky is adjusting his message to reality. Victory will not come \u201ctomorrow or the day after tomorrow\u201d, he says. But it is not some fantastical dream. Ukraine deserves to win, and the West should back it. The Russian army is losing \u201clots of people\u2019\u2018 and redeploying its reserves to stop the Ukrainian advance, he says: \u201cIt means they lose.\u201d\nTapping loudly on the table, Mr Zelensky rejects outright the idea of compromise with Vladimir Putin. War will continue for \u201cas long as Russia remains on Ukrainian territory\u201d, he says. A negotiated deal would not be permanent. The Russian president has a habit of creating \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d on Russia\u2019s borders (in Georgia, for example), not as ends in themselves but because his goal is to \u201crestore the Soviet Union\u201d. Those who choose to talk to the man in the Kremlin are \u201ctricking themselves\u201d, much like the Western leaders who signed an agreement with Hitler at Munich in 1938 only to watch him invade Czechoslovakia. \u201cThe mistake is not diplomacy. The mistake is diplomacy with Putin. He negotiates only with himself.\u201d \nCurtailing aid to Ukraine would only prolong the war, Mr Zelensky argues. And it would create risks for the West in its own backyard. There is no way of predicting how the millions of Ukrainian refugees in European countries would react to their country being abandoned. Ukrainians have generally \u201cbehaved well\u201d and are \u201cvery grateful\u201d to those who sheltered them. They will not forget that generosity. But it would not be a \u201cgood story\u201d for Europe if it were to \u201cdrive these people into a corner\u201d. \nMeanwhile, a long war of attrition would mean a fork in the road for Ukraine. The country would lose even more people, on the front lines and to emigration. It would require a \u201ctotally militarised economy\u201d. The government would have to put that prospect to its citizens, Mr Zelensky says; a new social contract could not be the decision of one person. Almost 19 months into the war, the president says he is \u201cmorally\u201d ready for the switch. But he will only broach the idea with his people if the weakness in the eyes of his Western backers becomes a \u201ctrend\u201d. Has that moment come? No, not yet, he says. \u201cThank God.\u201d \u25a0", "description": "But Ukraine\u2019s president fears that some of his country\u2019s Western backers are losing faith", "ogDescription": "But
