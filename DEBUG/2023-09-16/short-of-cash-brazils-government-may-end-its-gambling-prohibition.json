"https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/09/14/short-of-cash-brazils-government-may-end-its-gambling-prohibition", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "IN 1946 THE glitzy Copacabana Palace hotel in Rio de Janeiro spun its last roulette wheel. That April Eurico Dutra, Brazil\u2019s president, banned games of chance, shutting casinos, betting shops and bingo halls. Soon such places may reopen. On July 24th the current president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, issued a provisional decree to regulate sports-betting websites, which until now have operated in a legal grey area. This is the first step, perhaps, in a process that will allow all sorts of gambling. \nCongress has until November to amend and vote on Lula\u2019s decree. The government wants to charge an 18% levy on the revenue of sports-betting websites and a 30m-real ($6m) fee for a five-year licence to operate one. It would create a regulator, the National Secretariat for Games and Betting. Opposition in Congress comes mainly from evangelical Christian lawmakers. There are too few to block the measure. \nThe main goal is to raise cash. Lula wants to eliminate the federal government\u2019s primary deficit, which is forecast to be 1.4% of GDP this year, by 2024. His promise not to increase income tax makes that harder. The quest for cash became more urgent this month, when the government published a budget for 2024 that contains expensive promises, like a big increase in the minimum wage. That has shaken investors\u2019 confidence in Lula\u2019s macroeconomic management, which had recently been high. Sports betting could eventually bring 15bn reais a year in revenue, said Fernando Haddad, the finance minister. That is a tenth of what would be needed to erase the deficit next year. \nCurrently, Brazil allows \u201cgames of skill\u201d, like poker and wagering on horse-racing. They constitute a big business, though most of the companies engaged in it operate from offshore. Legal betting companies\u2019 turnover is expected to be 12bn reais this year, 70% higher than in 2020, according to BNLData, a Brazilian group that provides information about the industry. The country is thought to be the world\u2019s eighth-biggest market for online gambling. Betting websites sponsor 19 of the 20 teams in the top domestic football division. Lula\u2019s decree closes a loophole that lets offshore companies operate in Brazil without regulation or paying tax. \nIt does not soften the hard line that Brazil has taken since Dutra\u2019s day on \u201cgames of chance\u201d, such as dice, bingo and roulette, most commonly played in casinos or other venues dedicated to gambling. But that prohibition may fall. A bill to legalise all gambling, languishing in Congress since 1984, has recently gained powerful supporters, including the presidents of both houses and, according to the tourism minister, \u201cthe majority of the government\u201d. \nSuch a step would itself be a gamble. In Brazil the betting business has been a spur to crime. The country\u2019s first mafia arose in the early 20th century to operate the jogo do bicho (animal game), which involves punters guessing which animal\u2019s image will be chosen in a draw and is especially popular in Rio. An estimated 27bn reais a year is spent on illegal gambling in Brazil, more than the drugs trade takes in. \nEven legal forms of gambling pose problems. Criminals use sports-betting websites as unwitting tools in money-laundering and match-fixing schemes. Brazil has a gambling-addiction problem, though it is not as big as in some other countries. A quarter of adult Brazilians who own smartphones wagered on a match last year. An estimated 0.5% of adults are addicted, a psychiatrist told Congress in 2021. That compares with 0.7% in Britain and more than 1% in the United States. \nA big question is whether such ills will get better or worse as Brazil opens up betting further. Lula\u2019s sports-betting decree appeals to cautious supporters of liberalisation like Jorge Kajuru, a senator who chairs the committee considering it. But he draws the line at permitting \u201chard gambling\u201d, which he says enriches organised crime. \u201cBicheiros and sleazy politicians will mostly be the owners of the casinos,\u201d Mr Kajuru says. \nIf wider liberalisation happens despite such qualms, Brazil would join a global trend. Countries such as America, Japan and Thailand are in the process of liberalising gambling. Casino groups are queuing up to invest. Brazil, if it opens up, could \u201cquickly become one of the world\u2019s largest\u201d gambling markets, says a spokesman for Playtech, a gambling-software company.\nAdvocates contend that, unlike gambling itself, liberalisation is a win-win proposition. It would curb criminality by introducing regulation and enrich the government. Some of the extra revenue could be spent on treating addiction. \u201cBy legalising gambling the state has more power to mitigate the negative effects,\u201d says Ricardo de Paula Feij\u00f3, a legal consultant. That sort of argument is gaining adherents. Rio\u2019s roulette wheels may spin once more. \u25a0", "description": "The illegal sort takes in more than the drugs trade", "ogDescription": "The illegal sort takes in more than the drugs trade", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230916_AMP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-09-14T11:55:18Z", "dateModified": "2023-09-14T11:55:20Z", "dateCreated": "2023-09-13T11:11:02Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-09-16T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "S\u00e3o Paulo", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/r92jfc0n0p98q1i6pogg6p0lsfalp842", "publication": [{"id": "/content/gucrc008ntvkmmigk294c8o88eeftlcb", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r9b9qloc688n26f6c6rnks7vqp9ipe2o", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/uvbnv4g3924v3sfeerdvucjcbhvfkd9v", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4988b1i62ub7fheabvgvng0bh53p5drn", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ntoktkt3mm18unj88g6l01nsa6kqu1fr", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/08rmn1bgdmacrm6k6rbqchqir7cre6jc", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/289bqaauqa2pp3csoebrj224p605vs2l", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/l18s9gdd8upm1gjhop94ch0vd643ksvh", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Latin America remains a playground for Russian intelligence", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/09/14/latin-america-remains-a-playground-for-russian-intelligence", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/cvo386httmqk2446sj227kgl1h4hiqog", "publication": [{"id": "/content/gucrc008ntvkmmigk294c8o88eeftlcb", "context": {"position": 600.38, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r9b9qloc688n26f6c6rnks7vqp9ipe2o", "context": {"position": 600.38, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/uvbnv4g3924v3sfeerdvucjcbhvfkd9v", "context": {"position": 600.38, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4988b1i62ub7fheabvgvng0bh53p5drn", "context": {"position": 600.38, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ntoktkt3mm18unj88g6l01nsa6kqu1fr", "context": {"position": 600.38, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/08rmn1bgdmacrm6k6rbqchqir7cre6jc", "context": {"position": 600.38, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/289bqaauqa2pp3csoebrj224p605vs2l", "context": {"position": 600.38, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/l18s9gdd8upm1gjhop94ch0vd643ksvh", "context": {"position": 600.38, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Short of cash, Brazil\u2019s government may end its gambling prohibition", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/09/14/short-of-cash-brazils-government-may-end-its-gambling-prohibition", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
