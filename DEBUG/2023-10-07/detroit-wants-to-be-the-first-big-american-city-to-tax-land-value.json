Look south-east, towards Canada, and you see a skyline thick with cranes. New towers are shooting up, old ones being rebuilt, and the pavements below are thick with pedestrians. Cross to the other bedroom, however, and you get quite a different view. Right up to the edge of a highway entire city blocks are occupied by nothing but tarmac. At 11am an ocean of surface parking is uninterrupted by even a single car.\nJust over a decade ago Detroit became the biggest American city to go bankrupt. Since then its city centre has made a remarkable recovery. The Book Tower, which was completely derelict in 2009, has been rebuilt at a cost of over $300m by Bedrock, a property firm owned by Dan Gilbert, Michigan\u2019s richest man. Yet though downtown is humming, huge parts of the city remain blighted. \nThe city now has a more ambitious plan to reduce the amount of vacant land. It intends to tax it. A lot. Will it work?\nThe idea, proposed by Mike Duggan, the city\u2019s pugnacious mayor, is to replace Detroit\u2019s current property tax with a split tax. In essence, assessors will distinguish between the value of its land and of the buildings on it. This done, the city\u2019s property tax will be reduced from 2% for every $1 of assessed value (which is less than market value) to 0.6%. To make up for the revenues lost, land will be taxed at a new rate of 11.8%, whether or not it has anything built on it. In Michigan changes to property-tax rates have to be approved by voters. A law to allow that cleared its first hurdle in the state House in late September. A referendum could happen in February.\nThe principle of taxing land instead of buildings has a long history. Over a century ago Henry George, a liberal economist, argued that the rich used land ownership to hoard the wealth being created by progress. His most dedicated fans adopted the slogan \u201cDo you see the cat?\u201d (based on a convoluted metaphor), to refer to his ideas that land ownership underpinned high inequality. Yet George\u2019s proposal\u2014a single tax on land value\u2014has barely been tried. If Mr Duggan\u2019s scheme becomes law, Detroit will be one of the first big cities anywhere in the world to implement one. \nHow come Detroit is able to try something so radical? One advantage, says Jay Rising, the city\u2019s chief financial officer, is that the city now raises very little from its current system. In 1959, according to a study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a think-tank in Massachusetts, the city\u2019s property tax raised over $1bn, adjusted for inflation. By 2019, after decades of economic decline, the figure had fallen to just $119m. \u201cIf this was 80% of our revenues, we\u2019d be a lot more nervous,\u201d says Mr Rising. In fact it is just 16%. Moreover, the value of residential land is very low, which makes it an easier sell to voters.\nThe hope is that taxing land more will in fact spur development. Right now, says Alex Alsup of Regrid, a data firm, Detroit has \u201ca very pure version of speculation\u201d. As downtown booms, people who bought land nearby years ago\u2014such as the owners of the car parks\u2014merely have to wait for investment nearby to raise the value of their own land. Higher taxes might force them to sell up to people who will build on it. \u201cIt is entirely possible that this land tax has the ability to free up properties,\u201d says Kofi Bonner, the ceo of Bedrock.\nThe bigger immediate benefit, though, comes from reducing taxes on most residents. The city argues that 97% of homeowners will get a tax cut. Lower tax rates on improvements ought to encourage people to invest in properties\u2014and help some avoid falling behind on their taxes. Though they raise little, Detroit\u2019s property taxes are punishing to poor homeowners. Between 2011 and 2015, according to a study published in 2019, one in four city properties went into tax foreclosure, their owners having fallen behind on payments. \nBut Bernadette Atuahene, one of the authors of that study, suggests that high rates were not the only problem. What mattered more was that after the great financial crisis, Detroit\u2019s assessor systematically overvalued the homes of the poorest residents. When people could not pay, Wayne County, which includes the city, added interest at 18%. Homes ended up auctioned, with any excess over the tax owed banked by the county. Ms Atuahene worries that the proposed new tax does nothing to fix this problem\u2014and if residential land ends up overvalued, may exacerbate it. \u201cWe currently have an assessment division that\u2019s not doing its job,\u201d she says. \nGetting assessments right is one of the long-standing challenges of land-value taxes, and explains why they are so rare. Still, if the city can do that well, there will be real gains. Gabriel McNeil, a 61-year-old former chef who now lives on disability benefits, says that even a small tax cut would help him a lot. Having bought his home for just $8,000 in 2013, he struggles with tax payments of thousands of dollars each year. \u201cThe property tax is not designed for lower-income people at all,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to keep up.\u201d For some, any cut is better than nothing. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which
