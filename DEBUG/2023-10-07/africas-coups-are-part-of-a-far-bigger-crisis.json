But in the 2020s they are back with a vengeance: the nine this decade account for more than a third of successful African putsches this century. At this rate there will be more of them in the 2020s than in any decade since the 1960s. \n\nAside from the latest one, in Gabon on August 30th, the seizures of power have been in the \u201ccoup belt\u201d. It is possible, if inadvisable, to walk some 6,000km from the Atlantic coast of west Africa to the shore of the Red Sea and stride only through countries where there have been coups in the past three years (see map). The trek from Guinea to Sudan would cross the Sahel, the region south of the Sahara where there have been two coups each in Mali and Burkina Faso since August 2020, and one in Niger in July. \nAfrica\u2014which covers an area larger than America, China, India, Japan and western Europe combined\u2014is more than its coup belt. Yet the takeovers are part of a broader political crisis. The most recent surveys by Afrobarometer, a pollster, find that in 24 of 30 countries approval of the idea of military rule has risen since 2014. \n\nContingent support is higher. On average across 36 countries more Africans (53%) would be willing to consider a military government than would rule it out (42%) \u201cif elected officials abused their power\u201d\u2014which they often do (see chart 1). Just 38% expressed satisfaction with \u201cdemocracy\u201d, the lowest share since at least 2014. The backing for potential strongmen or deep dissatisfaction with democracy was common across the coup belt, but also in relatively stable places, including Botswana and South Africa (see chart 2). Afropopulism, for want of a better phrase, is an increasingly potent force. \nWhy is there such widespread discontent? Africans are frustrated with the sham that passes for \u201cdemocracy\u201d in most countries. They are also fed up with flimsy states that provide neither security nor prosperity. Around two-thirds of them, as well as majorities in 28 of 36 polled countries, feel their countries are heading in the wrong direction. Should this continue, many Africans, especially younger ones, may be tempted to reconsider shabby social contracts\u2014and look for radical change.\n\nThe most important failure is the provision of security. African states are often strong in areas where they ought to be weak and weak where they ought to be strong. Many regimes are adept at beating or locking up opponents, but inept at stopping their citizens from being robbed or killed. As a consequence, those promising to restore security, however ruthlessly, can gain support from ordinary citizens. \nAlthough some African wars in the late 20th century were much deadlier, the overall number of African conflicts is rising, according to a paper published last year by the Peace Research Institute Oslo. It noted that small conflicts caused more deaths in 2021 than at any point since its data began in 1989. The number of conflicts in which at least one side is a state was higher in 2021 than a decade earlier. \nMounting chaos\nSince 2021 things have become only bloodier. In Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, a trio of countries where jihadists linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State run riot, deaths in conflict have risen from under 800 in 2016 to over 10,000 in 2022. It is no coincidence that all three have gone from being largely democratic to suffering coups in the 2020s. Putschists have sought to justify their takeovers and gained support by pointing to insecurity under democracy. \nAs the jihadist chaos spills into coastal states, political chaos could follow. Togo, for example, has a dynastic dictatorship like the one recently toppled in Gabon: the Gnassingb\u00e9 family has run the country for 56 years. And it faces growing jihadist insecurity\u2014at least 140 people have been killed since July 2022. \nIn Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, jihadists terrorise the north-east, gangs kidnap hundreds at a time in the north-west and armed separatists pillage the south-east. Clashes between farmers and herders in the centre add to the bloodshed. More than 10,000 people died in conflict in the country in both of 2021 and 2022. This year will be almost as bad. ACLED, a conflict-tracking group, rates Nigeria as having the fifth-most extreme violence globally, behind Ukraine. \nNigeria\u2019s political class, lounging in well-guarded mansions, is out of touch. Turnout in this year\u2019s election was 29%, the lowest ever. More than 40% of Nigerians think it would be legitimate for the armed forces to take over in the event of abuses of power by elected leaders. Before the election senior Nigerian political figures told The Economist they had heard of coup-plotting. That is a troubling development, given that the country was run (abysmally) by military dictators for much of the second half of the 20th century.  \nHarsh ingredients\nOther large countries are riven with conflict. Though the civil war centred on Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region may be over, clashes in Amhara and Oromia spiral on. Resurgent violence in the east of Congo has caused almost 3m people to flee from their homes since March 2022. In April 2023 Sudan plunged into civil war. All three countries are among Africa\u2019s ten most populous. In every place people will seek protection where they think they can find it.\nInsecurity is felt beyond war zones. In a poll of 30 countries around the world released last month by Open Society Foundations, an NGO network, four of the five countries with the highest share of respondents fearing political violence were African: Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. The latter\u2019s murder rate, among the highest in the world, is rising again. Lawlessness increases support for populists and vigilantes. And 72% of South Africans would swap elected governments for a crime-bashing strongman. One former cabinet minister, who campaigned against apartheid, praises Paul Kagame for Rwanda\u2019s apparent lack of crime (but says less about its abuses of human rights). \u201cKagame has the right idea: sometimes you need to crack the whip.\u201d \nEconomic stagnation compounds the political crisis. From 1990 to 2018 the number of people living in extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 284m to 433m, as population growth often outstripped the economic sort. The region has lost another decade: real GDP per person was lower in 2022 than ten years earlier. \nHouseholds and governments are also facing a tightening financial squeeze. The median inflation rate in sub-Saharan Africa has more than doubled since the start of the pandemic. In a region where food makes up 40% of consumption, there is double-digit food-price inflation in 80% of countries. Some 17% of government revenues will be spent on servicing external debt this year, the highest share since 1999. \n\u201cJob creation\u201d is by far the most-cited priority by 18- to 35-year-olds in Afrobarometer polls. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation, a British NGO, reckons that 18m formal jobs must be created annually to absorb the numbers entering the labour force; the current figure is 3m. Almost half of 18- to 24-year-olds in 15 countries surveyed last year by the Africa Youth Survey, a poll by a South African charity, said they were thinking of emigrating. Young Nigerians talk of \u201cadulthood na scam\u201d and hunt ways to japa, Yoruba slang for to emigrate.\nEarlier this year Hakainde Hichilema, whom the West sees as a rare liberal on the continent, warned his outside champions that African democrats need to secure material results or they will face political consequences. \u201c[Y]ou can\u2019t eat democracy,\u201d argued Zambia\u2019s president in an opinion piece urging foreign creditors to speed up debt restructuring. \u201cHuman rights may sustain the spirit, but not the body.\u201d \nThe desperation to meet basic needs partly explains why Africans may be relatively willing to consider strongmen. The Open Society poll asked whether authoritarians would produce better results in ten policy areas, such as creating jobs and fighting crime. In eight cases the sub-Saharan African average was higher than the global one. \u201cInvariably, juntas that promise better material conditions will show up and win enough people\u2019s hearts and minds,\u201d notes Ken Opalo of Georgetown University in America. \nNevertheless, Africans\u2019 faith in what passes for democracy is plummeting not just because of the insecurity and poverty their governments deliver, but also because of the nature of politics itself. In the 1990s and 2000s most African countries ditched one-party systems and embraced multi-party elections. The pageantry of elections, however, obscures the fact that much of Africa has only the patina of democracy. EIU, our sister outfit, classifies just one African country (Mauritius) as a \u201cfull democracy\u201d and six as \u201cflawed\u201d. Between 1990 and 2019 sitting presidents won 88% of the 112 elections they ran in. \nNine leaders have kept power for more than 20 years. These include Uganda\u2019s Yoweri Museveni; Cameroon\u2019s Paul Biya, who spends much of the year in a Swiss hotel; Equatorial Guinea\u2019s Teodoro Obiang, the longest-serving president of any country; and Mr Kagame. All fear fair elections; all may be grooming a son for office. \nEven relative newbies abuse the law, entrenching frustration. In August Zimbabwe\u2019s main opposition party did not contest yet another dubious election because it sees the courts as biased. A month earlier the Central African Republic\u2019s president won a referendum he rammed through the courts that will end term limits. In 2020 Alassane Ouattara, president of Ivory Coast, won a third term after controversially tweaking the constitution so he could get around the two-term limit. Senegal\u2019s Macky Sall this year opted against a similar move after violent protests. But any goodwill earned was undermined by the arrest of hundreds of opposition-party members, including a presidential candidate.\nOn average in Afrobarometer polls only 13% believe that no one in their country\u2019s presidency is corrupt. Transparency International (TI), a watchdog, finds that sub-Saharan African countries are on average seen as less clean than El Salvador, where graft is so endemic that a millennial authoritarian has promised to build a huge jail specially for white-collar criminals. On average, perceptions of corruption in sub-Saharan Africa were slightly worse in 2022 than they were a decade earlier, reckons TI.\nThe Open Society poll found that corruption was the gravest national issue for voters in Ghana and Nigeria. Voters also fret about it in South Africa, where \u201cstate capture\u201d became ubiquitous under Jacob Zuma, president from 2009 to 2018. The looting of state institutions remains a problem in South Africa today\u2014and in many other countries. \u201cThe capture of democratic political systems by private power networks is arguably the greatest threat to civil liberties and inclusive development in Africa,\u201d argues Nic Cheeseman of the University of Birmingham in Britain. \nYouth and experience\nPutschists exploit anger at graft\u2014and it works, at least initially. In a poll before the first coup in Mali, 58% of people thought most or all the people in the presidency were corrupt. Two years and a second coup later, just 25% did. In Guinea the share before the coup was almost 50%. After it the share fell to 28%. \nWhy doesn\u2019t dissatisfaction with sham democracy spur Africans to try to obtain a better version of it? There are several reasons. For a start it is fiendishly difficult to oppose dictatorships. The bad guys usually have the guns. Ruling parties also often co-opt NGOs and youth groups. Many activists have tried to improve democracy and to vote out authoritarians. Yet after decades of failing, some may be concluding that only more radical methods, even coups, can end stagnation and state capture. Guinea\u2019s main opposition leader, for example, told The Economist of his \u201crelief\u201d immediately after the coup that ousted Alpha Cond\u00e9, then president, in 2021.\nSecond, there is reason to believe that support for liberal democracy is softer than its champions would wish. In Mali, for example, support for the idea of military rule had been flat for years at just under 30% before the first coup. Now almost 80% of Malians say they approve or strongly approve of rule by military men. \nAlthough outsiders may point out that liberal democracy has never really been tried in Africa, that is not always the view of Africans. Last month Olusegun Obasanjo, a former Nigerian president, said: \u201cWe have seen that the liberal type of democracy as practised in the West will not work for us.\u201d Mr Kagame has argued similarly. (\u201cThe West does not define democracy in Africa.\u201d) In the Africa Youth Survey just 39% of respondents said that Africans should emulate \u201cWestern democracy\u201d; 53% said Africa needed to find its own version.\nIndeed, too much is often expected of young Africans.

What those look like will vary depending on the context.

But in the 2020s they are back with a vengeance: the nine this decade account for more than a third of successful African putsches this century. At this rate there will be more of them in the 2020s than in any decade since the 1960s. \n\nAside from the latest one, in Gabon on August 30th, the seizures of power have been in the \u201ccoup belt\u201d. It is possible, if inadvisable, to walk some 6,000km from the Atlantic coast of west Africa to the shore of the Red Sea and stride only through countries where there have been coups in the past three years (see map). The trek from Guinea to Sudan would cross the Sahel, the region south of the Sahara where there have been two coups each in Mali and Burkina Faso since August 2020, and one in Niger in July. \nAfrica\u2014which covers an area larger than America, China, India, Japan and western Europe combined\u2014is more than its coup belt. Yet the takeovers are part of a broader political crisis. The most recent surveys by Afrobarometer, a pollster, find that in 24 of 30 countries approval of the idea of military rule has risen since 2014. \n\nContingent support is higher. On average across 36 countries more Africans (53%) would be willing to consider a military government than would rule it out (42%) \u201cif elected officials abused their power\u201d\u2014which they often do (see chart 1). Just 38% expressed satisfaction with \u201cdemocracy\u201d, the lowest share since at least 2014. The backing for potential strongmen or deep dissatisfaction with democracy was common across the coup belt, but also in relatively stable places, including Botswana and South Africa (see chart 2). Afropopulism, for want of a better phrase, is an increasingly potent force. \nWhy is there such widespread discontent? Africans are frustrated with the sham that passes for \u201cdemocracy\u201d in most countries. They are also fed up with flimsy states that provide neither security nor prosperity. Around two-thirds of them, as well as majorities in 28 of 36 polled countries, feel their countries are heading in the wrong direction. Should this continue, many Africans, especially younger ones, may be tempted to reconsider shabby social contracts\u2014and look for radical change.\n\nThe most important failure is the provision of security. African states are often strong in areas where they ought to be weak and weak where they ought to be strong. Many regimes are adept at beating or locking up opponents, but inept at stopping their citizens from being robbed or killed. As a consequence, those promising to restore security, however ruthlessly, can gain support from ordinary citizens. \nAlthough some African wars in the late 20th century were much deadlier, the overall number of African conflicts is rising, according to a paper published last year by the Peace Research Institute Oslo. It noted that small conflicts caused more deaths in 2021 than at any point since its data began in 1989. The number of conflicts in which at least one side is a state was higher in 2021 than a decade earlier. \nMounting chaos\nSince 2021 things have become only bloodier. In Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, a trio of countries where jihadists linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State run riot, deaths in conflict have risen from under 800 in 2016 to over 10,000 in 2022. It is no coincidence that all three have gone from being largely democratic to suffering coups in the 2020s. Putschists have sought to justify their takeovers and gained support by pointing to insecurity under democracy. \nAs the jihadist chaos spills into coastal states, political chaos could follow. Togo, for example, has a dynastic dictatorship like the one recently toppled in Gabon: the Gnassingb\u00e9 family has run the country for 56 years. And it faces growing jihadist insecurity\u2014at least 140 people have been killed since July 2022. \nIn Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, jihadists terrorise the north-east, gangs kidnap hundreds at a time in the north-west and armed separatists pillage the south-east. Clashes between farmers and herders in the centre add to the bloodshed. More than 10,000 people died in conflict in the country in both of 2021 and 2022. This year will be almost as bad. ACLED, a conflict-tracking group, rates Nigeria as having the fifth-most extreme violence globally, behind Ukraine. \nNigeria\u2019s political class, lounging in well-guarded mansions, is out of touch. Turnout in this year\u2019s election was 29%, the lowest ever. More than 40% of Nigerians think it would be legitimate for the armed forces to take over in the event of abuses of power by elected leaders. Before the election senior Nigerian political figures told The Economist they had heard of coup-plotting. That is a troubling development, given that the country was run (abysmally) by military dictators for much of the second half of the 20th century.  \nHarsh ingredients\nOther large countries are riven with conflict. Though the civil war centred on Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region may be over, clashes in Amhara and Oromia spiral on. Resurgent violence in the east of Congo has caused almost 3m people to flee from their homes since March 2022. In April 2023 Sudan plunged into civil war. All three countries are among Africa\u2019s ten most populous. In every place people will seek protection where they think they can find it.\nInsecurity is felt beyond war zones. In a poll of 30 countries around the world released last month by Open Society Foundations, an NGO network, four of the five countries with the highest share of respondents fearing political violence were African: Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. The latter\u2019s murder rate, among the highest in the world, is rising again. Lawlessness increases support for populists and vigilantes. And 72% of South Africans would swap elected governments for a crime-bashing strongman. One former cabinet minister, who campaigned against apartheid, praises Paul Kagame for Rwanda\u2019s apparent lack of crime (but says less about its abuses of human rights). \u201cKagame has the right idea: sometimes you need to crack the whip.\u201d \nEconomic stagnation compounds the political crisis. From 1990 to 2018 the number of people living in extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 284m to 433m, as population growth often outstripped the economic sort. The region has lost another decade: real GDP per person was lower in 2022 than ten years earlier. \nHouseholds and governments are also facing a tightening financial squeeze. The median inflation rate in sub-Saharan Africa has more than doubled since the start of the pandemic. In a region where food makes up 40% of consumption, there is double-digit food-price inflation in 80% of countries. Some 17% of government revenues will be spent on servicing external debt this year, the highest share since 1999. \n\u201cJob creation\u201d is by far the most-cited priority by 18- to 35-year-olds in Afrobarometer polls. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation, a British NGO, reckons that 18m formal jobs must be created annually to absorb the numbers entering the labour force; the current figure is 3m. Almost half of 18- to 24-year-olds in 15 countries surveyed last year by the Africa Youth Survey, a poll by a South African charity, said they were thinking of emigrating. Young Nigerians talk of \u201cadulthood na scam\u201d and hunt ways to japa, Yoruba slang for to emigrate.\nEarlier this year Hakainde Hichilema, whom the West sees as a rare liberal on the continent, warned his outside champions that African democrats need to secure material results or they will face political consequences. \u201c[Y]ou can\u2019t eat democracy,\u201d argued Zambia\u2019s president in an opinion piece urging foreign creditors to speed up debt restructuring. \u201cHuman rights may sustain the spirit, but not the body.\u201d \nThe desperation to meet basic needs partly explains why Africans may be relatively willing to consider strongmen. The Open Society poll asked whether authoritarians would produce better results in ten policy areas, such as creating jobs and fighting crime. In eight cases the sub-Saharan African average was higher than the global one. \u201cInvariably, juntas that promise better material conditions will show up and win enough people\u2019s hearts and minds,\u201d notes Ken Opalo of Georgetown University in America. \nNevertheless, Africans\u2019 faith in what passes for democracy is plummeting not just because of the insecurity and poverty their governments deliver, but also because of the nature of politics itself. In the 1990s and 2000s most African countries ditched one-party systems and embraced multi-party elections. The pageantry of elections, however, obscures the fact that much of Africa has only the patina of democracy. EIU, our sister outfit, classifies just one African country (Mauritius) as a \u201cfull democracy\u201d and six as \u201cflawed\u201d. Between 1990 and 2019 sitting presidents won 88% of the 112 elections they ran in. \nNine leaders have kept power for more than 20 years. These include Uganda\u2019s Yoweri Museveni; Cameroon\u2019s Paul Biya, who spends much of the year in a Swiss hotel; Equatorial Guinea\u2019s Teodoro Obiang, the longest-serving president of any country; and Mr Kagame. All fear fair elections; all may be grooming a son for office. \nEven relative newbies abuse the law, entrenching frustration. In August Zimbabwe\u2019s main opposition party did not contest yet another dubious election because it sees the courts as biased. A month earlier the Central African Republic\u2019s president won a referendum he rammed through the courts that will end term limits. In 2020 Alassane Ouattara, president of Ivory Coast, won a third term after controversially tweaking the constitution so he could get around the two-term limit. Senegal\u2019s Macky Sall this year opted against a similar move after violent protests. But any goodwill earned was undermined by the arrest of hundreds of opposition-party members, including a presidential candidate.\nOn average in Afrobarometer polls only 13% believe that no one in their country\u2019s presidency is corrupt. Transparency International (TI), a watchdog, finds that sub-Saharan African countries are on average seen as less clean than El Salvador, where graft is so endemic that a millennial authoritarian has promised to build a huge jail specially for white-collar criminals. On average, perceptions of corruption in sub-Saharan Africa were slightly worse in 2022 than they were a decade earlier, reckons TI.\nThe Open Society poll found that corruption was the gravest national issue for voters in Ghana and Nigeria. Voters also fret about it in South Africa, where \u201cstate capture\u201d became ubiquitous under Jacob Zuma, president from 2009 to 2018. The looting of state institutions remains a problem in South Africa today\u2014and in many other countries. \u201cThe capture of democratic political systems by private power networks is arguably the greatest threat to civil liberties and inclusive development in Africa,\u201d argues Nic Cheeseman of the University of Birmingham in Britain. \nYouth and experience\nPutschists exploit anger at graft\u2014and it works, at least initially. In a poll before the first coup in Mali, 58% of people thought most or all the people in the presidency were corrupt. Two years and a second coup later, just 25% did. In Guinea the share before the coup was almost 50%. After it the share fell to 28%. \nWhy doesn\u2019t dissatisfaction with sham democracy spur Africans to try to obtain a better version of it? There are several reasons. For a start it is fiendishly difficult to oppose dictatorships. The bad guys usually have the guns. Ruling parties also often co-opt NGOs and youth groups. Many activists have tried to improve democracy and to vote out authoritarians. Yet after decades of failing, some may be concluding that only more radical methods, even coups, can end stagnation and state capture. Guinea\u2019s main opposition leader, for example, told The Economist of his \u201crelief\u201d immediately after the coup that ousted Alpha Cond\u00e9, then president, in 2021.\nSecond, there is reason to believe that support for liberal democracy is softer than its champions would wish. In Mali, for example, support for the idea of military rule had been flat for years at just under 30% before the first coup. Now almost 80% of Malians say they approve or strongly approve of rule by military men. \nAlthough outsiders may point out that liberal democracy has never really been tried in Africa, that is not always the view of Africans. Last month Olusegun Obasanjo, a former Nigerian president, said: \u201cWe have seen that the liberal type of democracy as practised in the West will not work for us.\u201d Mr Kagame has argued similarly. (\u201cThe West does not define democracy in Africa.\u201d) In the Africa Youth Survey just 39% of respondents said that Africans should emulate \u201cWestern democracy\u201d; 53% said Africa needed to find its own version.\nIndeed, too much is often expected of young Africans. Many of them are apathetic when confronted with the fa\u00e7ade of democracy. They are more than twice as likely to say they did not vote in the last election as the over-56s. In Nigeria\u2019s election this year young voters helped Peter Obi to the best-ever result for a third-party candidate but he still came only third. In South Africa\u2019s last general election only 30% of eligible 20-somethings voted\u2014from apartheid to apathy in a single generation. \nSupport for military rule if elected leaders abuse power is highest among the young. On average 56% of 18- to 35-year-olds would contemplate it, versus 46% of those aged 56 and older. It is young men who rally in support after coups, complicating potential efforts by African countries or the West to reverse takeovers. \nNot that outsiders\u2019 commitment to African democracy is especially strong\u2014the third reason for its feebleness. The continental organisation, the African Union, is weak and ultimately the creature of its mostly authoritarian members. Regional hegemons such as South Africa carry less weight: economic stagnation means it has less hard power, while endorsing rigged elections in Zimbabwe and elsewhere means it has less soft power. Meanwhile, China skews aid towards corrupt autocratic regimes, as the Chinese Communist Party preaches its model to Africa\u2019s ruling parties. Russia, whether through the notorious Wagner Group or via arms sales, props up juntas and authoritarians. Newer players such as Turkey and Gulf countries will not promote democratic norms. \nThe West offers half-hearted help and hypocrisy. It sometimes speaks out when elections look sketchy, as was the case this year in Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone. But America decided to whitewash dodgy results in mineral-rich Congo in 2018. Britain is unlikely to criticise Mr Kagame given that it wants to fly asylum-seekers to Rwanda. France rails against coups in countries where it stands to lose influence, such as Niger, but says little when the putschists are in tune with Paris, as was the case with Chad\u2019s coup in 2021.\nFran\u00e7afrique\u2014the term given to how France has maintained influence in former colonies by propping up autocratic elites\u2014is coming back to bite Paris. In Mali a survey in 2021 found that more than a fifth of Malians believed that France\u2019s armed forces in the country were in league with jihadists or separatists. In Burkina Faso the new president, 35-year-old Captain Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, says that he is restoring sovereignty. It is the free choice of his junta, like Mali\u2019s, to ask Russia for help. After Niger\u2019s coup, the junta quickly scapegoated France, which had troops fighting jihadists in the country. Crowds waved Russian flags and decapitated a rooster painted in French colours. In Senegal, protesters against Mr Sall\u2019s flirtation with a third term burned down French-owned supermarkets and petrol stations. Half of Ivorians say that France is the country they trust least, according to Premise Data, a pollster. \nWinter of discontent\nSo long as Africans see\u2014and experience\u2014\u201cdemocracy\u201d as a charade played by corrupt elites with the help of foreigners, then many will consider other options. What those look like will vary depending on the context. In South Africa frustration at meagre progress since apartheid is opening up space for Julius Malema, a hard-left black nationalist, and for ethnic-based parties. In Nigeria the efforts of Nnamdi Kanu, a separatist, to resuscitate the dream of an independent Biafra rely on charisma, populism, disregard for the truth and violence. \nElsewhere populist military men may prove appealing, at least temporarily. In Burkina Faso Captain Traor\u00e9 chooses deliberately to mimic Thomas Sankara, a revered former socialist leader often referred to as Africa\u2019s Che Guevara. He came to power in a coup in 1983 aged 33 before being gunned down four years later. France has been a butt of both men. \nThere is a well-intentioned desire to see Africans, especially younger ones, as a latent progressive force. But it is also patronising to deny, given the present circumstances amid what passes for democracy on the continent, that many Africans will be tempted by authoritarians. They are no more immune to populism than Americans are to Donald Trump, or Turks are to Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They will gravitate to those who seem to meet their needs\u2014or at least offer a change from those who manifestly do not. \u25a0", "description": "Democracy is under threat from graft, stagnation and violence", "ogDescription": "Democracy is under threat from graft, stagnation and violence", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231007_IRP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-10-03T18:51:15Z", "dateModified": "2023-10-05T12:47:58Z", "dateCreated": "2023-10-03T18:46:20Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-10-07T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "CAPE TOWN AND DAKAR", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/7fied3rvfpciktgotman52rbdsobkjfe", "publication": [{"id": "/content/c94lh5bc3u3ega76jbohe6thuilhnnbo", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/tojv0hev5spkhd7ftfak48vr6c18iodm", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/idndovcvf7l7vfi1709s4ri4ofpfahmv", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/j2o6819ri83cq424ue6dtle6baivkv33", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/7pdh11df2vsfr4rakplq70u6aj6aqv1j", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/vbh3d90anttp8os45sqghtq3dmhcesdf", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/i8b0r1crg2h4no736mda7qqr5tep9ukp", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/fhr9icq2av90u2hle5bpjgacs324bc96", "context": {"position": 1300.47, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Africa\u2019s coups are part of a far bigger crisis", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/03/africas-coups-are-part-of-a-far-bigger-crisis", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
