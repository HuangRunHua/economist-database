It features American weapons and military paraphernalia. Some rooms are decorated with American flags. A speech by President Franklin Roosevelt is engraved in stone in the courtyard. This is the Stilwell Museum, a site dedicated to the memory of Joseph Stilwell. The feather-ruffling American general served in China during the second world war.\nThough he has been dead for nearly 80 years, Stilwell\u2019s name has been in the news lately. In August the Chinese embassy in Washington announced that China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, had replied to a letter from Stilwell\u2019s grandson, John Easterbrook. Weeks later it was reported that Mr Xi had also corresponded with two veterans of the \u201cFlying Tigers\u201d, a group of mercenary American pilots who fought on China\u2019s side in the war. In both letters Mr Xi called for better relations with America.\nWhy is Mr Xi reaching out to these people? The Stilwell Museum provides some clues. It describes the general as \u201ca great friend\u201d to China. From 1942 to 1944 he served as commander of American forces in China, Burma and India, and as chief of staff to Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) government in China. The museum is built on the grounds of Stilwell\u2019s residence in Chongqing, which was China\u2019s wartime capital (at that time the city\u2019s name was romanised as Chungking). The general\u2019s main task was to help the Chinese fight the Japanese invaders and to oversee the delivery of American military aid to Chiang\u2019s forces.\nNicknamed \u201cVinegar Joe\u201d, Stilwell had strong opinions about his allies\u2014and was not afraid to air them. He clashed often with Chiang, whom he called \u201cthe peanut\u201d. In his diary he documented the KMT\u2019s corruption, dithering and incompetence. Acting on an appeal from Stilwell in 1944, Roosevelt wrote a letter to Chiang threatening to cut off aid if he didn\u2019t give the general unrestricted command of all Chinese forces. Stilwell hand-delivered it, writing in his diary: \u201cThe harpoon hit the little bugger right in the solar plexus and went right through him.\u201d\nStilwell\u2019s disdain for Chiang may help explain why such a museum is allowed to exist. The KMT, after all, had also been fighting Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists. Stilwell was instructed to get the parties to co-operate against Japan. The museum says he \u201cmade positive contributions\u201d to Mao\u2019s forces and promoted a \u201cbetter and correct understanding\u201d of their cause. That may be overstating it, but Stilwell did support the American army observer mission sent to establish relations with the Communists. He also complained to Roosevelt that Chiang was hoarding supplies in order to use them against Mao\u2019s army after the Japanese were defeated.\nAnother reason for China\u2019s decision to open the museum in 1991\u2014and why Mr Xi is writing letters\u2014may be the Communist Party\u2019s evolving view of the second world war. After seizing control of the mainland in 1949, the party refused to acknowledge America\u2019s help during the conflict owing to its support for the KMT. But its attitude has slowly changed. Today it recognises America\u2019s role in helping China to fight Japan. Moreover, the party under Mr Xi has shifted from portraying China as a victim of the second world war to a victor. This reassessment has helped shape China\u2019s assertiveness abroad and rising nationalism at home, writes Rana Mitter, a British academic who specialises in Chinese history, in his book \u201cChina\u2019s Good War\u201d. \nSome people are evoking Sino-American co-operation during the second world war to call for better relations today. In his letter to the pilots, Mr Xi said America and China \u201cshould and must achieve mutual respect\u201d. But there was little respect between leaders back then. In his diary, Stilwell described an urge to bite a radiator after noting that Chiang \u201csits on his hands and watches with great glee the fool Americans who actually get out and fight.\u201d Not long after he delivered Roosevelt\u2019s note to the KMT leader, the general was recalled.
