But now these red envelopes, stuffed with cash, are part of a push by China\u2019s banks to get citizens thinking about retirement. They are being offered to customers who register for private-pension accounts.\nUnder a law introduced last November, workers may set aside savings in tax-deferred accounts accessible upon retirement, much like America\u2019s Individual Retirement Accounts (iras). Those who want to enrol must open an account with a bank, before allocating their deposits to a licensed wealth manager. Savers can deduct contributions from taxable income; they pay no tax on capital gains and only a 3% tax rate at the time of distribution.\nIf these terms sound attractive, it is because officials cannot afford for the scheme to fail. Chinese workers retire young\u2014as early as 50 for women and 60 for men. Last year the population shrank for the first time since Mao Zedong\u2019s \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d in 1962, even as the number of old folk grew. China\u2019s compulsory basic pension, which has more than a billion enrollees and is paid for through employer contributions, will be in deficit by 2028 and run out entirely by 2035, according to modelling by an official think-tank. \nWhen the reforms were introduced, analysts estimated that they would raise the value of China\u2019s private pensions from $300bn (which had accumulated during the pilot version of the scheme), to at least $1.7trn by 2025. Such a pot would rival the world\u2019s largest pension funds and give officials capital to channel to favoured industries. The scheme would also give Chinese people a new avenue for saving, drawing them away from the country\u2019s troubled property market. Unfortunately, though, things are not going entirely to plan.\nBanks, which are mostly state-owned, have offered customers incentives to open accounts, including discounts on phone bills, rewards for referrals and even free ibuprofen (there was a shortage at the time). Although these have lured customers, with more than 40m having signed up by June, getting them to actually save is a struggle. In March fewer than one-third of accounts contained funds. The government has since stopped releasing figures, but there is little reason to believe that savings have risen in the intervening period. Moreover, the president of one bank estimates that 70% of funds deposited go uninvested, remaining in bank accounts, perhaps because depositors want to enjoy the tax advantages without entering financial markets they perceive to be risky.\nWhat is going wrong? Some of the problems facing the pension system reflect its design. Banks, with which customers are required to open accounts, are unfazed by the low contributions. They simply want to beat their rivals on sign-ups, and some are too busy defusing bad debts to focus on pensions, notes an analyst.\nBut there are deeper issues at play, too. Officials say that workers are unaware of the importance of pension planning. Bankers propose bigger tax breaks and a higher maximum contribution, which is currently 12,000 yuan ($1,700) a year, or 15% of the average disposable income in Shanghai. Neither group wants to confront the possibility that the problem is even more profound. Chinese stockmarkets have long struggled to attract investors, with households preferring property. Financial assets are seen as too volatile\u2014and too vulnerable to political interference.\nThe situation is unlikely to improve any time soon. Pension pots cannot be invested offshore, meaning that they do not offer a way to escape a weak domestic economy. Local stockmarkets are not exactly becoming any more alluring: Shanghai\u2019s main equity index is down this year. The government is also expected to raise the retirement age, which delays when savers can gain access to their investments. Last month the pensions ministry was forced to refuse requests from working-age depositors to withdraw their funds. All this means that another worry\u2014a failing private pension system\u2014can be added to the long list facing Chinese policymakers. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in
