India is hosting the quadrennial Cricket World Cup, which begins on October 5th, as by far the dominant power in the world\u2019s second-biggest game by viewership (after football). The sport is increasingly run according to the demands of Indian administrators, whether in India or the dozen-odd other countries where it is a front-rank pursuit. They are backed by the revenues generated by India\u2019s vast, cricket-mad TV audience. The six-week-long cricket World Cup, which will see the world\u2019s ten strongest national sides compete in the one-day format of the game, may be the richest, most watched and also the most overtly politicised ever held.\nMore than 712m Indians\u2014roughly the number that watched televised cricket in 2018\u2014are expected to tune in, especially if their team does well, as is predicted. Indian companies are vying for their eyeballs, with unicorns such as Upstox, a fintech firm, and Dream11, a gaming one, joining old stagers such as MRF Tyres among the event\u2019s 18 official sponsors. The World Cup will provide a tableau of India\u2019s economic emergence\u2014and the disruption it is bringing to a game sometimes described as Indians\u2019 single shared passion.\nGiven that status, cricket has long been considered illustrative of India, even as the country has changed. Mr Nandy\u2019s book, published in 1989, is remembered for its opening aphorism but not its argument. Which was that cricket\u2019s agrarian roots and leisurely rhythms presented a \u201ccritique of urban industrial society\u201d acutely relevant to underemployed Hindus. If there was ever truth to that, it was already being swept away by a modest rise in India\u2019s economic prospects during the 1980s, in cricket and otherwise. The country\u2019s first hosting of the World Cup, in 1987, provided an early demonstration of this. \nIt also established a pattern. The tournament, by far the biggest international event India hosts, has returned twice to the country, in 1996 and 2011, each time providing a vivid account of India\u2019s progress. The rendition held in 1996 showcased the more impressive growth launched by liberal reforms passed in 1991. It is remembered for a fierce advertising battle between Coca-Cola and Pepsi, both recently given unfettered access to the Indian market.\nThe contest in 2011 marked another step-change. India\u2019s cricket industry had ballooned on the back of a new domestic tournament, the Indian Premier League (IPL), which uses an American-style franchise model. Also striking was a new confidence. When India\u2019s team went on to win the tournament, Indian commentators proclaimed a new era of Indian domination. What, in the light of these World Cup milestones, will the next six weeks reveal?\nMore growth, obviously. Advertising revenues for the tournament are projected to be between 20bn and 22bn rupees ($240m-264m), at least 48% more than was generated by the previous World Cup, held in England. Such numbers explain the Indian cricket board\u2019s dominance. Last year it sold five-year broadcast rights to the IPL for $6bn. Its total revenues were 44% more than those of its closest rival, the England and Wales Cricket Board. \nCricket\u2019s popularity commands political attention, as the tournament will also show. It has indeed long been coveted by Indian politicians; Jawaharlal Nehru captained a Prime Minister\u2019s XI. Yet in recent decades, the growth of television\u2014then smartphone\u2014ownership, which took cricket from a few big cities to India\u2019s furthest corners, hugely increased its political potency. Among the politicians who piled in, Sharad Pawar, India\u2019s agriculture minister between 2004 and 2014, ran cricket in Maharashtra, India and, through the International Cricket Council, the world. As chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi took over the state\u2019s cricket board in 2009. As prime minister he has achieved something new: a systematic takeover of cricket by his Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp).\nThe World Cup\u2019s opening game, pitting England against New Zealand, is in the 130,000-seat Narendra Modi Stadium in the Gujarati city of Ahmedabad. Completed in 2020, the world\u2019s biggest cricket stadium was first used to host a rally for Mr Modi and Donald Trump. It is the prime minister\u2019s Coliseum, a venue for Modi-themed cricket extravaganzas, BJP rallies or both. Ahead of a match between Australia and India there in March Mr Modi appeared alongside his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, in a sort of golden chariot. The adoring crowd reportedly included 80,000 BJP workers, given free tickets. \nIf India makes it to the World Cup final there, on November 19th, Mr Modi will no doubt attend. So will his de facto deputy, Amit Shah, another former boss of cricket in Gujarat; and Mr Shah\u2019s son, Jay Shah, who runs India\u2019s cricket board. Cricket under Mr Modi, like so much else, has been centralised and co-opted.\nAs well as illustrating Mr Modi\u2019s flair for amassing power, his party\u2019s cricket management reflects its troubling use of it. Indian Muslims are fairly represented in cricket. Around 12% of professional players are Muslim, in line with their share of the population. Yet those who play for India are targeted by the Islamophobic trolls that have multiplied under Mr Modi. \nPakistan\u2019s cricketers are faring worse. Once superior to India\u2019s (elegant Indian batsmen struggled against fierce Pakistani fast bowling) cricket in Pakistan has deteriorated with the country. India is twisting the knife. The younger Mr Shah, who also runs the Asian Cricket Council, has helped throttle cricket ties between the two countries. Pakistan\u2019s players, in a gratuitous slight, were the last to receive their visas and schedule for the World Cup.\nSuch bullying Indian behaviour has been a feature of its rise in cricket, which has intensified under the BJP. The spread of private Indian cricket leagues is eroding the primacy of international competition, one of cricket\u2019s distinctive features, and weakening foreign cricket boards. India\u2019s cricket bosses are deaf to the complaints this is raising. Viewing cricket as an arm of national power, they are mainly intent on increasing their control of it. The ICC\u2019s media revenues were in the past split fairly evenly between cricket-playing countries. Between 2024 and 2027 India will pocket 39%. How it spends the cash is unclear. Most Indian cricket loot is handed to state-level boards, often run by politicians. Hardly any provide audited accounts. \nIndian cricket bosses dismiss foreign criticism as sour grapes. In fact the cricket world has accepted the reality of India\u2019s dominance; no one disputes its right to enrich and reshape its game. Yet great power is supposed to bring more responsibility, which India\u2019s bosses seldom display. As an early demonstration of the power India is accruing in many fields, its behaviour in cricket is largely discouraging. \u25a0", "description": "India dominates the sport.
