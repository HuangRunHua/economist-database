But official statistics show that membership has fallen by nearly 20% since Mr Xi became China\u2019s leader. \nThis may not reflect any change in young people\u2019s desire to join. Mr Xi\u2019s reforms have aimed to make the league more elite. Teachers have been told not to sign up entire classes, as once was common (and is still the accepted practice for the Young Pioneers, a league-controlled organisation for children aged six to 14). Schools have been given quotas for how many students they can recruit.\nThe league is not trying to raise the ratio of members to non-members in its target age-group. Indeed, it has set a cap of 30% for 2025, which suggests that it plans little change. But it is trying to expand membership in private firms and NGOs. Among China\u2019s 50m registered private firms, the league\u2019s presence is still tiny. Between 2018 and January 2022, however, the number of league branches in such businesses more than tripled to above 300,000. In Yinchuan this year, league officials announced a plan to establish branches in all of the firms in the western city\u2019s industrial parks by September. With the help of a recently developed database, known as Smart League Building, the organisation can keep much better tabs on such activity. All league members have to register their personal details on this system.\nMr Xi\u2019s eagerness to boost the league\u2019s influence may seem at odds with a common belief that at least part of his decade in power involved a struggle with senior leaders who had once served in senior roles in the league. Such officials are often referred to as members of the tuanpai, or \u201cleague faction\u201d. Under Mr Xi they have become far more marginal at the top of the party hierarchy. But there is little evidence that the league has operated as a factional bastion. More likely, Mr Xi prefers to surround himself with former colleagues, and he has never held office in the league. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Doyon of Sciences Po, a university in Paris, notes that the league\u2019s administration is still a big source of recruitment for leadership positions in the provinces.\nAs Mr Xi sees it, the league has a crucial role to play. Even a decade ago he was warning its officials of a global \u201cclash of ideologies\u201d involving ceaseless efforts by \u201cdomestic and foreign hostile forces\u201d to Westernise and divide China. This was making it even more imperative, he said, to provide China\u2019s youngsters with \u201cstrong guidance\u201d on their ideals and beliefs. Which is why, between occasional outings to revolutionary sites and performing good deeds in their neighbourhoods, recruits can expect plenty of time in the classroom, studying the thoughts of Mr Xi.

Attached was a music video, its lyrics suffused with patriotic rhetoric and interspersed with clips of speeches by Mao Zedong and the country\u2019s current leader, Xi Jinping. So far, so predictable. The surprise was the singer and his style: a rapper whose early songs about drugs and violence were deemed unfit for public airing. gai, as he is known, has turned a new leaf. He is now the league\u2019s mc.\nThe Communist Party\u2019s youth wing is a vast organisation. With 74m members it is nearly as large as the party (98m), from which it is separate although some of its members have both affiliations. It plays a big role in China\u2019s political life. The league indoctrinates people aged between 14 and 28 in the party\u2019s ideology, trains potential party members and helps the party to identify talent that can be groomed for high office. It also has an outward-facing task: spreading the party\u2019s message among young people with no political ties. After he assumed power in 2012, Mr Xi worried that the league was not up to the job. Officials admitted that it had become out of touch with young Chinese.\nFor the party, China\u2019s youth are a growing problem. The economy is stagnating, unemployment is rife among the young and housing costs are sky-high. Late last year small youth-led protests broke out in several cities. They were aimed at Mr Xi\u2019s draconian \u201czero-covid\u201d regime (subsequently abandoned). With extraordinary bravery, a few demonstrators in Shanghai even called on Mr Xi to step down. He will be mindful of the pro-democracy turmoil of 1989, when some of the league\u2019s officials joined the protesters. That period of upheaval across the communist world haunts Mr Xi. He often harks back to the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, which he blames on a breakdown in ideological orthodoxy and discipline. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the Communist Youth League makes a thousand mistakes,\u201d he said in 2015, quoting Deng Xiaoping. \u201cBut one mistake it cannot make is to deviate from the party\u2019s track.\u201d\nIn June Mr Xi declared that since 2012 the organisation had acquired a \u201cbrand new image\u201d. But also that month the league\u2019s chief, A Dong, said that amid \u201cprofound and complex changes\u201d at home and abroad, \u201cthe overall fighting spirit and capabilities of the entire organisation urgently need to be improved.\u201d This will involve pushing ahead with sweeping reforms that began in 2016. They range from cutting bloated management to expanding the league\u2019s grassroots presence and tightening controls over membership.\nHoning the league\u2019s propaganda skills is also part of this effort. People like gai, whose real name is Zhou Yan, are helping. In 2018 Chinese netizens speculated that, after gai\u2019s rise to stardom on reality TV shows, his performing days on officially approved platforms might be numbered: that year the government reportedly ordered broadcasters not to use artists representing \u201chip-hop culture\u201d, or even sporting tattoos (gai has plenty: \u201cBadkidz\u201d says one in English). \u201cHip-hop\u2019s prospects in China seem dim after Chinese rappers removed from TV shows\u201d, said a headline in Global Times, a staunchly party-loving tabloid. The story noted gai\u2019s disappearance from the airwaves. But the newspaper\u2019s prediction soon proved wrong. The league began to turn to rappers, including gai, to make itself appear more in tune with the country\u2019s youth.\nSlick videos featuring these and other singers have been pushed out by the league through a plethora of social-media accounts. By August last year, the organisation\u2019s central administration was running 26 of these with a total of more than 200m followers, according to China Youth Daily, the league\u2019s newspaper. The league\u2019s main account on WeChat had a following of 110m, making it one of the biggest accounts on social platforms, the report said. Online, the organisation began referring to itself as tuantuan (\u201cleague-league\u201d). In Chinese, doubling a syllable makes a name sound cuter\u2014pandas\u2019 names are routinely formed this way.\nAttack, attack\nTo Western ears, the rhetoric used by these accounts is often far from endearing. Mr Xi has pushed the new-look league to the front line of China\u2019s online nationalism, using it to flood the internet with criticism of the West and of anyone in China with negative views of the party. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we voice our opinions?\u201d he asked the league\u2019s leaders in 2013. \u201cGood prevails over evil. When positive voices online become powerful, the impact of negative public opinion can be reduced.\u201d\nLeague accounts have been used to heap vitriol on Western journalists, sow disinformation and to attack dissidents suspected of trying to foment a \u201ccolour revolution\u201d. In 2021 the league promoted a conspiracy theory that sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19, was developed in an American military lab. The hashtag the league created on Weibo to spread this story has been viewed about 1.5bn times\u2014an average of more than once per person in China. In recent weeks the league\u2019s accounts have whipped up public anger against Japan for releasing treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant, which was destroyed by a tsunami 12 years ago\u2014ignoring support for the plan among many scientists elsewhere.\nThere is no doubt that nationalist rhetoric excites many young Chinese. It is less clear, however, how much the league\u2019s online presence is helping it recruit the kind of people it says it needs to create \u201chealthy and vigorous new blood\u201d for the party itself. Of Chinese aged between 14 and 28, about one-third are members (the league\u2019s officials can be older). But official statistics show that membership has fallen by nearly 20% since Mr Xi became China\u2019s leader. \nThis may not reflect any change in young people\u2019s desire to join. Mr Xi\u2019s reforms have aimed to make the league more elite. Teachers have been told not to sign up entire classes, as once was common (and is still the accepted practice for the Young Pioneers, a league-controlled organisation for children aged six to 14). Schools have been given quotas for how many students they can recruit.\nThe league is not trying to raise the ratio of members to non-members in its target age-group. Indeed, it has set a cap of 30% for 2025, which suggests that it plans little change. But it is trying to expand membership in private firms and NGOs. Among China\u2019s 50m registered private firms, the league\u2019s presence is still tiny. Between 2018 and January 2022, however, the number of league branches in such businesses more than tripled to above 300,000. In Yinchuan this year, league officials announced a plan to establish branches in all of the firms in the western city\u2019s industrial parks by September. With the help of a recently developed database, known as Smart League Building, the organisation can keep much better tabs on such activity. All league members have to register their personal details on this system.\nMr Xi\u2019s eagerness to boost the league\u2019s influence may seem at odds with a common belief that at least part of his decade in power involved a struggle with senior leaders who had once served in senior roles in the league. Such officials are often referred to as members of the tuanpai, or \u201cleague faction\u201d. Under Mr Xi they have become far more marginal at the top of the party hierarchy. But there is little evidence that the league has operated as a factional bastion. More likely, Mr Xi prefers to surround himself with former colleagues, and he has never held office in the league. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Doyon of Sciences Po, a university in Paris, notes that the league\u2019s administration is still a big source of recruitment for leadership positions in the provinces.\nAs Mr Xi sees it, the league has a crucial role to play. Even a decade ago he was warning its officials of a global \u201cclash of ideologies\u201d involving ceaseless efforts by \u201cdomestic and foreign hostile forces\u201d to Westernise and divide China. This was making it even more imperative, he said, to provide China\u2019s youngsters with \u201cstrong guidance\u201d on their ideals and beliefs. Which is why, between occasional outings to revolutionary sites and performing good deeds in their neighbourhoods, recruits can expect plenty of time in the classroom, studying the thoughts of Mr Xi.
