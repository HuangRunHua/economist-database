There\u2019s \u201cDaddy Robot\u201d, where Bandit can be assigned chores, and \u201cHotel\u201d, where the workers (the children) repeatedly wake up the guest (Bandit). No five-star review for them. \n\u201cBluey\u201d, a hit series about four Blue Heeler dogs, first aired on Australian television on October 1st five years ago. It is, at heart, a celebration of the whimsical games adults and children play together. The creator, Joe Brumm, who is an Australian animator, draws on his own experience of bringing up little ones. He has said that playing make-believe with his two girls is \u201cjust like being in a \u2018Monty Python\u2019 sketch\u201d. Youngsters know a bit about how a caf\u00e9 or hospital works, but they have to ad lib to fill the gaps\u2014usually with surreal and amusing results.\nMr Brumm envisaged \u201cBluey\u201d as Australia\u2019s answer to \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d, a beloved (and lucrative) British animated series. He has succeeded. The pups\u2019 antics are watched in more than 60 countries. In America, more than 23m hours of \u201cBluey\u201d were streamed in a single week in July: an impressive feat given each instalment is around seven minutes long. \nWhy has it become such a global success? There is the wholesome premise: a family having fun, which parents like to show their children. There is an instructive element, too, as the dogs usually learn something about the real world as a result of their japes. For children who expect a present from every party they go to, \u201cPass the Parcel\u201d teaches them about the joy of generosity. \u201cBluey\u201d is also beautifully designed, with calming hues and soft music. It makes a pleasant change from the gaudy colours and ear-splitting noise used in many kids\u2019 programmes. \nThe show has its critics. It revolves around a bog-standard two-parent, two-child unit, even though families come in all shapes and sizes. Some gender stereotypes persist, too. Although Bandit is involved in parenting, he is, like Daddy Pig, too often the fun parent while Chilli, the mother, does domestic chores and organises the family. Some claim the show puts pressure on parents to be constant play companions to their children.\nBut also \u201cBluey\u201d entertains parents, who will have played many made-up games with their own children. Parents empathise with Bandit\u2019s sighs and understand why Chilli \u201clikes being by herself\u201d. The characters provide a model for young and old alike. Bandit and Chilli evince a saintly patience and calm. Few, for instance, would let their children make an almighty mess as they discover just how many eggs need to be broken to make an omelette. But when it comes to cracking the recipe for a happy family\u2014and audience\u2014\u201cBluey\u201d has done it. \u25a0", "description": "The surprise hit show first aired five years ago and has
