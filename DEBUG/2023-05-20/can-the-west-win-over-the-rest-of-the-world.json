As Mr Putin has demonstrated, dictators unconstrained by pesky checks and balances at home find it easier to launch illegal attacks on their neighbours. And as Ukrainians have shown, standing up to those attacks is easier when there are clearly articulated and prized values, as well as territory, to fight for. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Reviving the G7", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Asia"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/rs4nm4v2h4rdrnt5hrncvqkmtr2sbrr4", "tegID": "rs4nm4v2h4rdrnt5hrncvqkmtr2sbrr4", "headline": "Asia", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/18/the-taliban-go-big-on-animal-welfare", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/us7tg03dpk4vecb1i89h1tl74rcq139r", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "The Taliban go big on animal welfare", "subheadline": "Pooches of the Panjshir", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T12:47:34Z", "description": "The Islamist fanatics also castrate dogs", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230520_ASP004.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/18/myanmars-conflict-is-dividing-south-east-asia", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/fqf015pkffjkmrerqnajl7js8oc7vg5g", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Myanmar\u2019s conflict is dividing South-East Asia", "subheadline": "Banyan", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T12:47:34Z", "description": "The region\u2019s leaders disagree on what to do about the conflagration.

In the ensuing decades the club of the world\u2019s largest rich democracies led the way on global economic policy. But its relevance faded as its share of the global economy declined. In 2009 Barack Obama, then America\u2019s president, declared that the G20, a broader grouping that includes China and other big developing countries, would become the pre-eminent forum; Donald Trump, his successor, went further, calling the G7 \u201coutdated\u201d. In the past year, however, the G7 has found a new sense of purpose amid another crisis, emerging as a forum for co-ordinating assistance to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. \nThose tasks will top the agenda at the next leaders\u2019 summit, to be held on May 19th-21st in Hiroshima, the hometown of Japan\u2019s prime minister, Kishida Fumio. Combating Russian sanction-busting is a priority. Japan, whose laws bar it from supplying lethal military aid, will also take up the mantle of post-war reconstruction in Ukraine, drawing on its experience in rebuilding after natural disasters. In a city emblematic of the horror of atomic destruction, Ukraine would like to see the G7 send Russia a \u201cclear message on nuclear threats\u201d, says Sergiy Korsunsky, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the big guys to say no and draw a clear line.\u201d \nYet the G7\u2019s support for Ukraine has also shown up the distance between the rich and developing world on the war. Even if disturbed by Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion, many poorer countries hesitate to condemn it forcefully and mainly grumble about its impact on food and energy markets. That discordance worries Japan, the G7\u2019s chair (and only Asian member). \nJapanese officials have therefore been on a listening tour ahead of the gathering in Hiroshima. In the past two months, Mr Kishida has visited Egypt, Ghana, India, Kenya, Mozambique and Singapore; his foreign minister, Hayashi Yoshimasa, toured Latin America. \u201cIn the midst of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, some global-south countries are facing great difficulties\u2026there is also a movement to try to divide the world by taking advantage of such situations,\u201d says Mr Kishida in an interview with The Economist and other outlets, using characteristically careful language.\n\nIn private, Japanese officials and diplomats are blunter: the West is losing to China when it comes to outreach to the global south. The G7\u2019s relative economic strength has been declining, and with it the pull of the international order it represents: the club-members\u2019 share of global GDP in nominal terms peaked at nearly 70% in the late 1980s, but dipped to under 45% in 2021. In purchasing-power parity terms, the BRICS grouping, of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has surpassed the G7\u2019s share (see chart). Japanese envoys reckon that the West is failing to convince many poorer countries of the benefits of the current order. They report hearing a litany of complaints about America from leaders elsewhere: concerning the tumult in American domestic politics; a lack of economic offerings in American trade policies; a lack of respect in American diplomacy. They fret that ruling elites in many developing countries are starting to prefer dealing with China, which offers more stability, more roads and bridges, and fewer lectures. In Japan\u2019s estimation, American preaching about democracy has been especially ineffective. \u201cLiberal democracy has proved a poor rallying cry,\u201d says one Japanese official.\nJapan hopes to tamp down the talk (favoured by President Joe Biden) of a battle between democracy and autocracy in favour of strong G7 support for the rule of law. Japanese officials reckon that standing for the inviolability of borders, rather than more nebulous values, will appeal to a wider range of potential partners and make clearer the benefits of an international system based on rules rather than raw power. It also avoids forcing countries into a binary choice, between liberal and illiberal powers, another Japanese official suggests: \u201cWe don\u2019t support creating new blocs.\u201d\nMr Kishida articulated that thinking in March in India, which is chairing the G20 this year and sees itself as the global south\u2019s leader. India is one of eight guests invited to observe the summit in Hiroshima, along with Indonesia, the current ASEAN chair; the Comoros, the African Union\u2019s chair; the Cook Islands, the Pacific Islands Forum chair; and Australia, Brazil, South Korea and Vietnam. Japan is trying to \u201cexpand whom we talk to, and how we talk to them,\u201d says Rahm Emanuel, America\u2019s ambassador to Japan. \u201cThe United States is 100% behind it in support of that.\u201d\nJapan also hopes to use this year\u2019s summit to connect the security concerns of the largely Euro-Atlantic G7 and the Indo-Pacific region. The meeting is \u201cboth a response to the war and a reminder of how to deter a future one,\u201d says Mr Emanuel. Mr Kishida has linked the fighting in Ukraine to China\u2019s threats against Taiwan. \u201cThe use of force to change the status quo must not be tolerated in any region, be it Europe or Asia.\u201d When the G7\u2019s foreign ministers met last month, they sought to project unified support for Taiwan in the wake of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s visit to Beijing, a trip that dismayed Japanese officials. The leaders\u2019 meeting in Hiroshima may produce a follow-up statement on a common approach to \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d, or China\u2019s practice of using trade and finance to punish others for geopolitical defiance. \nThe summit thus reflects the diplomatic role\u2014consensus-building and strategic\u2014that Japan sees itself playing in a changing world. \u201cJapan needs to bridge,\u201d says Jimbo Ken of Keio University in Tokyo. Japanese diplomacy is well suited to it, especially in the Indo-Pacific. Japan understands the region \u201cmuch better than any other G7 member,\u201d says Bilahari Kausikan, a former senior Singaporean diplomat. It can help by \u201ctempering the wilder flights of fancy\u201d of other Western G7 members. \nYet Japan\u2019s measured approach has some downsides. Its officials talk about the rule of law \u201cinternationally but not internally\u201d, notes Sahashi Ryo of the University of Tokyo. Keeping quiet on rights abuses or democratic backsliding for the sake of coalition-building risks letting future problems fester. As Mr Putin has demonstrated, dictators unconstrained by pesky checks and balances at home find it easier to launch illegal attacks on their neighbours. And as Ukrainians have shown, standing up to those attacks is easier when there are clearly articulated and prized values, as well as territory, to fight for. \u25a0", "description": "The G7 wants to
