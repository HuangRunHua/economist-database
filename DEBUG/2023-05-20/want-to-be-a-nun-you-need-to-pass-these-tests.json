The 14th-century saint and mystic had many virtues: she could pray for hours, fast for days and devoted herself to God for years. Some of the statements found on a typical psychometric form, such as \u201c136. I cannot keep my mind on one thing\u201d, would have held no fear for Saint Catherine.\nBut she might have had more difficulty with others. For she was also tormented by pornographic visions in which she saw \u201cshameless crowds dancing\u201d. She believed she had been married to Christ in a secret ceremony, and that she wore his invisible foreskin on her finger in lieu of a wedding ring. Having to respond to statements such as number 257 (\u201cI have strange and peculiar thoughts\u201d) might have tripped her up.\nNone of this mattered to Catherine\u2019s career in the medieval era: she was canonised after her death and is revered as a saint to this day. But it would have been more problematic in the modern one, because since 2005 the Catholic church in Britain has been using stringent psychometric tests to screen applicants to religious and to holy orders. Those who feel called by an invisible, intangible God to become a monk, nun or priest now have to commit not only to poverty, chastity and obedience but also to three days\u2019 worth of psychiatric interviews and tests (among them, the double-edged \u201c139. I often hear voices without knowing where they come from.\u201d)\nThe church started such tests for many reasons. One obvious one was an attempt to screen out potential abusers\u2014but the decision \u201cwas not only focused on \u2018We have to rule out paedophiles\u2019,\u201d says Rev Dr Gerard Fieldhouse-Byrne, who runs the British testing centre, St Luke\u2019s, in Manchester. The idea stemmed instead from a \u201cbroader\u201d vision\u2014to select people who could cope with the demands of a life of service and celibacy. \u201cWhat we want are healthy priests.\u201d\nThe Catholic church has long recognised that a life of celibate solitude and prayer can test even the sturdiest mental constitutions. Father Gerard enjoys his career but admits that \u201cthere are times\u2026when I feel the loneliness\u201d. Since the fourth century the church has produced monastic \u201cRules\u201d\u2014self-help guides governing every hour of a monk\u2019s day and night with precision and, at times, great wisdom. Read such guides and they will tell you to intersperse the rigours of  intellectual work with hearty exercise; to make sure to toady to the boss (\u201cLet no one dare to dispute insolently with his abbot\u201d); and to avoid boozing in the workplace since \u201cwine makes even the wise to fall away\u201d. \nLike all rules, they hint at their own inefficacy. Read them closely and you catch glimpses of behaviour that, after decades of solitude spent behind monastic walls, has started to stray from social norms. One unexpected but unarguable rule states that if anyone wishes to \u201cdefecate into a pot or a jar or any other vessel\u2026they shall ask the Male Eldest\u201d.  \nThere \u201ccan be a fine line\u201d between extreme religiosity and psychopathology, says Thomas Plante, a professor of psychology at Santa Clara University in California who administers similar tests in America. William James, a pioneering Victorian psychologist, was one of the first to suggest that immortal visions might be affected by the psychology of the mortal mind that was experiencing them. James recorded the case of a man who, whenever he was high on laughing gas, believed he knew the secret of the universe, but forgot it when he sobered up. Finally, with great effort, he managed to write it down while still intoxicated, and once sober, rushed to see what he had written. There he read: \u201cA smell of petroleum prevails throughout.\u201d\nEccentricity is not unique to religion, says Father Timothy Radcliffe, a Dominican friar and fellow of Blackfriars Hall in Oxford. \u201cWould you think any artist would be completely normal?\u201d Instead of normality, he suggests joy as a measure of the religious life. Partly since those who enjoy it have \u201cdiscovered the deepest happiness\u201d. And also since if \u201cyou want to give yourself to this crazy life\u201d, then \u201cprobably you\u2019re not going to be completely normal\u201d. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest
