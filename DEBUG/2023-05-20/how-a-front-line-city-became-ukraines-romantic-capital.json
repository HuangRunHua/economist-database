Of the passengers who aren\u2019t soldiers on their way to nearby Bakhmut, almost all on board are the wives and girlfriends of those already fighting. Viktoria, 27, and Karolina, 29, have travelled to see their men Alexander, 32, and Vladimir, 33, who are waiting for them on the platform. A day before, Alexander and Vladimir were fighting fierce battles in Bakhmut. Now they have swapped their rifles for roses. The couples embrace silently, and depart for rented apartments on the outskirts.  \nKramatorsk, an industrial city of 150,000 before the latest invasion, is reinventing itself as a romantic destination. On the front line since 2014, Russia\u2019s renewed onslaught in February 2022 brought its very existence into question. Within a few weeks, Kramatorsk\u2019s factories shut down and most of its civilian population fled. Now the city is profoundly militarised. But it exudes a new kind of energy as a romantic hub for soldiers who aren\u2019t allowed to travel far from fighting in Bakhmut and Avdiivka. There may be no hotels\u2014they closed after one was bombed last summer\u2014but a network of apartments, rentable by the day or hour, fills the gap. The city\u2019s tourist infrastructure\u2014flower shops, gift shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s\u2014has prospered. \n\nArtyom, an estate agent, says he has done good trade ever since the Kyiv train started running again in October. Some 80% of his business is now short-term lets to soldiers and their partners; the rest is long-term accommodation for refugees. At 1,000 hryvnia ($27) for 24 hours, Artyom\u2019s going rate is twice the pre-war level, and as expensive as in parts of Kyiv. But demand is strong, fuelled by good military salaries. The women usually arrive on the express train on Saturday, he says, and stay for a day or two. \u201cThe town comes to life at weekends, with couples walking arm-in-arm through the park, even with the booms and sirens of war.\u201d The nearest Russian positions to Kramatorsk are 20km away, putting the city within easy range of multiple-rocket systems and S-300 missiles. \nThere is a lively market for commercial love, too. Two brothels have opened since the fighting began last year. One, tucked away in the city\u2019s industrial district, operates under the close watch of the army. On May 14th four soldiers waited in a queue outside the building. The madam was initially reluctant to admit them all\u2014one was obviously drunk\u2014but eventually did. This reporter was invited to sign up for a 4,000-hryvnia slot on the next day. Business is obviously thriving. \u201cNow is not the time to tackle morality,\u201d says a military official. \u201cThe only thing we are concerned about is that the soldiers don\u2019t say things they shouldn\u2019t, and the girls don\u2019t pass on things to the enemy.\u201d\nThe source need not be too concerned. A conversation with the sex workers later reveals that they see themselves as integral parts of the war effort. \u201cWe are here to lift our wonderful boys\u2019 spirits,\u201d says Natalie, a blonde in her mid-20s. \u201cThey are defending us, and we want to help them in any way we can.\u201d Natalie says her collective works 24/7, through air raids, and has even done outcalls to positions nearer the front lines. Before Kramatorsk the women were based in Mykolaiv, another front-line city in southern Ukraine, but they moved when they heard that their regular customers deployed to Bakhmut: \u201cWe knew that many of them wouldn\u2019t return alive, and we wanted to be near them.\u201d The women say they frequently hear about clients who have been killed or severely injured. \nManiasha says her 18-year-old son is fighting in the army. She tried to stop him from enlisting, but is proud he did. Now, even the appearance of a young soldier at the brothel makes her cry. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop yourself thinking this lad will head to the front lines and never return,\u201d she says. \u201cYou do whatever you can to give him confidence, to caress him. You tell him he is a fighter, a hero.\u201d The encounters are not always about sex, says Natalie. \u201cSometimes the soldiers simply want the warmth of another human being.\u201d Bakhmut has traumatised many of them. \u201cThe psychological condition of those coming out of there is dreadful, just dreadful.\u201d \nFor the first time in months the news coming from the blackened town down the road is encouraging. An unexpected surge from Ukraine is turning the tide of the battle, a full 11 months after it began. Much of the high ground on the town\u2019s northern and southern flanks is now back under Ukrainian control. The Wagner mercenary group, the most aggressive of Russian forces, is much diminished; the Russians have been suffering staggering losses. Yet the Ukrainian soldiers returning after their weekends in Kramatorsk are guarded about any possible success. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant danger,\u201d says Alexander, who will be back at his position within two days. His wife, Viktoria, says the pair made many plans during their weekend together. \u201cLove is a powerful weapon. It\u2019s the little fire that will keep my man alive.\u201d \u25a0\nSign up to The War Room, our new newsletter covering defence and international security.", "description": "Just 30km from the
