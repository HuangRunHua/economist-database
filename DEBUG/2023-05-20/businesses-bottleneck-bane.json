The first is its unusual genre. First published in 1984, it is a management tome dressed up in the clothes of a thriller. The book, written by Eliyahu Goldratt and Jeff Cox, tells the story of Alex Rogo, a plant manager who has to overhaul his factory within three months or face closure. \nTo the objection that this is not thrilling at all, consider that it could have been a lot worse (\u201cAlan Key must format a slide deck by midnight or he won\u2019t get enough sleep to function properly the next day\u201d). And Rogo\u2019s efforts to reduce excess inventory and win over Bill Peach, his hard-driving boss, are weirdly entertaining. In any case readers lapped it up. \u201cThe Goal\u201d sold millions. It has been reprinted several times. It even got turned into a graphic novel.\nIts second contribution was to popularise thinking about bottlenecks. The novel was written to get across Goldratt\u2019s \u201ctheory of constraints\u201d, a method for identifying those resources whose capacity does not match the demands placed on them. (This definition comes from one of the book\u2019s protagonists\u2014Jonah, a brilliant, globe-trotting business adviser whose resemblance to a real person seems unlikely to be coincidental.) \nBottlenecks are often thought of as physical constraints. In Rogo\u2019s factory, for example, the bottlenecks are two particular machines whose through-put must be increased in order to ship orders faster. In recent years the pandemic has increased awareness of such bottlenecks in the wider supply chain, whether because of the impact of semiconductor shortages or the effect of backlogs at congested ports. \nPolicies can be bottlenecks, too. The pandemic also forced vaccine manufacturers to ditch normal patterns of working. In \u201cVaxxers\u201d, a book about their work to develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca covid-19 jab, Sarah Gilbert and Catherine Green describe how they did more \u201cat risk\u201d work, doing things in parallel that would usually have been done sequentially. That would have meant wasted work if they had hit a problem, but also that scientists got stuff done much faster than usual. Bill Peach would have approved.   \nPeople are also bottlenecks. Within organisations, managers themselves are frequently the points at which things get bunged up. That might be because executives simply have too much to do. Estimates vary on how many direct reports a manager should ideally have. But if they don\u2019t all fit in a lift, you almost certainly have too many. \nIt might be their own fault\u2014if they are micromanagers, say, offering up helpful opinions on everything from font sizes to office furniture. It might be because no one is comfortable making a decision for fear of being hauled over the coals later by their own boss. It might be because there is jockeying and confusion over who has the right to make a call (an \u201cupward status disagreement\u201d, if you like jargon; a \u201cpissing contest\u201d, if you don\u2019t).              \nBottlenecks can stem from good behaviour as well as bad. Collaboration is normally celebrated, but it can easily result in more delays if people\u2019s time is being soaked up on non-essential tasks. Similarly, the person who responds to every message quickly and clears their inbox every night looks like the very opposite of a bottleneck, but that depends on two things: on what work they are not doing while they manically check their email, and on whether those messages are about trivial things. If people are responding at great speed on matters of zero importance\u2014especially if they are high up the ladder and colleagues are therefore likely to respond to them in turn\u2014they are probably creating trouble of some sort. \nWhatever the causes of congestion, the costs can be material. Daniel Ek, the boss of Spotify, attributed a recent restructuring at the music-streaming company to the need to make faster decisions. Consultants at McKinsey have estimated that about 530,000 days of managers\u2019 time each year may be wasted on broken decision-making processes at a typical Fortune 500 company. \n\u201cThe Goal\u201d is not the greatest thriller ever. No one dies. The only real violence done is to the English language (\u201cIt\u2019s not until I\u2019m busy with my delicious veal parmesan that my thoughts start to crystallise\u201d). But it is a lot more readable than most business books, and it makes you think about a subject that is relevant not only to supply-chain managers and operations managers but to bosses everywhere.
