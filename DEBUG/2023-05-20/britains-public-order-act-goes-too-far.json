At the National Gallery they upended a can of tomato soup over van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d before gluing themselves to the wall. On the M25 they climbed the gantries, forcing the motorway to close for hours. They have tunnelled beneath railway lines and chained themselves to bridges, halting construction and traffic. \nOn May 2nd, in an attempt to curb this sort of behaviour, the government implemented the Public Order Act, which makes it a criminal offence to obstruct major transport works and interfere with \u201ckey national infrastructure\u201d. It also makes it an offence to \u201clock on\u201d to \u201canother person, to an object or to land\u201d in a way that could cause \u201cserious disruption\u201d to two or more individuals or an organisation. More significantly, it criminalises the mere act of carrying locking-on equipment \u201cwith the intention\u201d to use it for this purpose.\nCivil-rights groups describe the law, which also gives the police new powers to stop and search, as draconian. Volker T\u00fcrk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said it imposed \u201cserious and undue restrictions\u201d on freedom of expression. Both it and another law passed in April 2022, that gave police powers to restrict public assemblies, have fuelled fears about the erosion of civil liberties in Britain. Planned legislation\u2014from a minimum-service-level law, that would curtail the ability to strike, to an online safety bill, which could limit freedom of expression\u2014show that the government is \u201cinherently censorious\u201d, says Mark Johnson of Big Brother Watch, a civil-liberties group.  \nThe first (recorded) use of the Public Order Act was seized upon by critics. On the morning of May 6th, the day of King Charles III\u2019s coronation, the Metropolitan Police used the law to arrest six members of Republic, an anti-monarchy group. It judged, it said, that \u201citems\u201d found among the group\u2019s \u201cNot my King\u201d placards, might have been intended for some sort of locking-on offence. It released the protesters without charge 16 hours later.\nIt is not uncommon for the police to make arrests that are not followed by charges. They may be more likely to do so at large public gatherings. Policing protests is tough and doing so at big, globally televised events especially so. Had the Met allowed protesters to block the king\u2019s procession route, say, it would have been savaged. Sir Mark Rowley, the Met\u2019s commissioner, has said intelligence led it to fear widespread disruption was planned. \nAnd although the right to protest is a fundamental part of a liberal democracy, the law has long placed limits upon it. The Human Rights Act 1998 both upholds that right and talks about \u201clawful restrictions\u201d necessary to protect \u201cnational security or public safety\u201d, \u201cthe rights and freedoms of others\u201d and to prevent \u201cdisorder or crime\u201d. On the day of the coronation dozens of people were also arrested for breaking older laws, including the Public Order Act 1986, which stops people causing \u201charassment, alarm and distress\u201d, and for breaching the peace (the 1936 version). \nYet the new Public Order Act goes too far. By giving police power to arrest people for carrying locking-on equipment, which could cover anything from bike locks to glue, it risks criminalising peaceful protest to a degree that many lawyers say is unacceptable. \u201cEveryday items could potentially be relied upon by police as a reason to arrest,\u201d says Kirsty Brimelow, a barrister and chair of the Criminal Bar Association. The vague yet broad wording of this part of the Public Order Act exacerbates the risk, she says. \u201cLaws need to be clear.\u201d\nFurther indicators of the Home Office\u2019s authoritarian tendencies have emerged in the days following the coronation. On May 11th the House of Lords said that the government department had tried to reintroduce as secondary legislation (a process which allows the government to modify laws with less scrutiny) parts of the Public Order Act that Parliament\u2019s upper chamber had rejected in February. \nThese elements include reducing the threshold for \u201cserious\u201d disruption, thus allowing the police to intervene in more circumstances. Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, a previous lord chief justice, said that this appeared to be the first time a government had tried to change the law through secondary legislation \u201ceven though those same changes had been rejected by Parliament when introduced a short while before in primary legislation\u201d.\nNone of this may matter much to most voters. A YouGov poll published on May 11th found that only three in ten Britons thought the police were too harsh on the day of the coronation. That may help explain why Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he won\u2019t repeal the Public Order Act. Sir Keir, anxious to sidestep Tory claims he is soft on crime, has said the law needs time to \u201csettle in\u201d. \nRichard Ekins, a law professor at Oxford and head of the judicial power project at Policy Exchange, a centre-right think-tank, says the law\u2019s inclusion of a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d defence means it will often be \u201cdifficult for police to know whether an arrest will be lawful and, especially, whether a prosecution is likely to succeed\u201d. Far from being authoritarian, he argues, the law is a \u201cfeeble\u201d attempt at reform.\nA law does not need to put people in prison to cause damage, however. This one risks further eroding trust in the police. Following a serious of dreadful scandals at the Met, Sir Mark has said he wants to restore \u201cpolicing by consent\u201d. Increasing the police\u2019s powers with a badly written law seems unlikely to achieve that.\nMore worrying, perhaps, the law seems likely to deter some people from protesting at all. Some activists, who reckon that getting arrested, ideally on film, is part of the point, may step up their actions. Others, fearful that joining a march or waving placards may leave them with a criminal record, may decide to stay at home. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "description": "The right to protest has long had limits.
