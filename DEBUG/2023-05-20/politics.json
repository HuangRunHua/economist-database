Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the candidate of an opposition alliance of six parties, got 45%. Mr Kilicdaroglu may now struggle to unseat Turkey\u2019s strongman, who has presided over rampant inflation. In a bad night for the opposition Mr Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development (AK) party retained a comfortable majority in parliament. \nOn a wing and a prayer\nVolodymyr Zelensky paid brief visits to Britain, France, Germany and Italy to drum up support for a \u201cjets coalition\u201d. France said it would train Ukrainian pilots to use combat aircraft. Germany promised \u20ac2.7bn ($2.9bn) in military aid and is to build a tank-repair factory in Ukraine. Britain pledged more air-defence systems and Storm Shadow missiles, Ukraine\u2019s first long-range cruise weapons. Mr Zelensky also met Pope Francis in Rome.  \nRussia launched more intense waves of missile attacks against Ukraine. One assault was described by officials as being \u201cexceptional in density\u201d. They said six hypersonic missiles had been shot down. Russia is increasing its bombardments ahead of an expected Ukrainian offensive. \nA deal that allows Ukraine to export grains safely across the Black Sea was extended by two months. The deal was first brokered by Turkey and the UN last July. Russia had threatened to pull out. It agreed to the last-minute extension, but said its conditions for taking part are still unmet. \nGunmen opened fire on an American embassy convoy in Nigeria\u2019s Anambra state, killing two policemen and two Nigerian embassy employees. Nigerian authorities blamed the attack on a Biafran secessionist group.\n\nA BBC investigation into Nigeria\u2019s presidential election in February uncovered significant discrepancies between the total number of votes cast at individual polling stations and the official results. The BBC\u2019s own count in Rivers state suggested that Peter Obi had the most votes; the official result declared the state was won by Bola Tinubu, the president-elect. \n\nThe commander of South Africa\u2019s army visited Russia to discuss military co-operation and how to improve the combat readiness of both countries\u2019 armies. The visit will further strain South Africa\u2019s relations with America after accusations that it had sent weapons and ammunition to Russia in breach of its stated position of neutrality.\nA court in Tunisia sentenced Rached Ghannouchi, a prominent opposition politician, to a year in prison.
