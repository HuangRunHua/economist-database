They are living on New York City\u2019s dime, but about 60 miles farther up the Hudson river.\nLast summer the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, began offering people who crossed the border seeking asylum free bus rides to New York City. New York\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams, blasted the tactic as inhumane and unAmerican. But in May, with the city\u2019s shelters full, Mr Adams began inviting migrants to catch buses northward. \nNewburgh\u2019s new residents are making the best of it, using Google Translate to talk to each other and watching Netflix; some are bingeing \u201cWelcome to Eden\u201d, a Spanish thriller about visitors to a place that is not the paradise it seems. As they wait for the government to decide if they merit asylum, they seem to have one big need. \u201cI want to ask you something,\u201d a man from Senegal said softly to a stranger outside the Crossroads. \u201cWe are looking for work.\u201d\nOscar Eduardo Angula Rivas, who is 29, said he could make just $15 a month as a policeman in his native Venezuela. So more than a year ago he left his wife and baby son at home and walked for three months, dodging immigration patrols and predatory smugglers, before fording the Rio Grande and requesting asylum. Unable to work legally, he said he considered returning home, but as a police officer who had left his post, he would be in danger. Mr Rivas, a tall man with an aristocratic bearing, held himself together until he showed a picture of his son, now two. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to leave your family behind,\u201d he said, taking off his glasses to wipe away tears. \nMr Rivas said he was robbed while living in a shelter in New York City, which he found crowded with migrants. He jumped at the chance when the city offered him a ride to Newburgh, believing it would be safer. \nIn sending his buses, Mr Abbott, a Republican, revelled in the politics, noting New York was a \u201csanctuary city\u201d that claimed to welcome immigrants. But he was also trying to focus national attention on the crisis at the border. He has sent migrants off to Washington, DC, Chicago and Philadelphia as well. \nMr Adams has accused Mr Abbott, who is white, of targeting \u201cblack-run cities\u201d. But he has also excoriated President Joe Biden. In April he said Mr Biden had \u201cfailed\u201d the city, and warned it was \u201cbeing destroyed by the migrant crisis\u201d. More than 60,000 people seeking asylum have arrived in New York since last spring, only some on Mr Abbott\u2019s buses. Roughly 41,000 are in shelters operated or paid for by the city. It expects to spend $2.9bn caring for them in the year ahead, more than on its fire  department.\nIn a twist on Mr Adams\u2019s accusation, upstate officials complain that the mayor, a Democrat, is targeting Republican areas such as Orange County, which includes Newburgh, and Rockland County just south of it. They say their shelters and schools are already strained by asylum-seekers who came on their own. Mr Adams is doing far more than Mr Abbott in promising to support the people on his buses for four months, but upstate officials wonder what will happen after that. They are suing to block the buses.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t operate this way,\u201d says Thomas Humbach, the Rockland county attorney, who successfully sought a temporary restraining order to stop Mr Adams from sending migrants there. \u201cYou have jurisdictional borders, you have territorial borders for a reason, so that people can run their areas the way they think they should be run.\u201d Like Mr Adams and Mr Abbott, Mr Humbach believes the federal government should rationalise immigration rather than leave each state, county or city struggling to harden its own borders. Some New York officials also want expedited permission for asylum-seekers to work.\nAfter Title 42, a pandemic-era border restriction, expired earlier this month, officials feared a surge of migrants. But new penalties for illegal crossings imposed by the Biden administration, combined with new mechanisms for receiving asylum requests, appear to have headed that off. Mr Biden, who has shifted to the centre on immigration as he runs for re-election, has come under criticism from his left for the restrictions and from his right as not being tough enough. The White House rightly says immigration reform requires action from Congress, where many representatives seem to prefer to have the problem to campaign on. \nThe real MAGA saga\nIf they would pause to weigh what has helped make America great, even before Queen Anne paid for Palatine refugees to settle Newburgh in 1709, they might consider the story of Melida Ramos, which began like that of Mr Rivas. Leaving a two-year-old son behind, Mrs Ramos left Honduras in the late 1980s and crossed the border with a coyote. She made her way to New York state, held down two jobs, and was later joined by her husband, who also crossed illegally.  The couple was later able to gain legal status and bring their son, by then nine, from Honduras. \nThey had a daughter in America in 1992 and called her Genesis. Genesis Ramos is now the county legislator representing much of Newburgh, where she was born, where her family has lived and worked for decades. She is trying to make the asylum-seekers welcome, and is frustrated with the county officials who want them out, and, to a degree, with Mr Adams. She wonders if fewer people might be shouting hate at the migrants from passing pickup trucks if Orange County had been better prepared. \nMs Ramos\u2019s family does not talk much about their story. \u201cIt is tough, and it is something that I think folks are made to feel ashamed of,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed. Because I seriously cannot imagine the courage it had to take. And I\u2019m proud of my mom for what she did.\u201d \u25a0\nRead more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics:\nDonald Trump has become more dangerous (May 11th)\nWhat walking from Washington to New York reveals about America (May 4th)\nWhy Israel is becoming a partisan cause in the United States (Apr 27th)\nAlso: How the Lexington column got its name", "description": "America\u2019s officials don\u2019t respect each other\u2019s borders.
