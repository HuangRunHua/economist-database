For all its shortcomings, it kept the peace between superpowers and underpinned decades of growth that lifted billions out of poverty. Today that order, based on global rules, free markets and an American promise to uphold both, is fraying. Toxic partisanship at home has corroded confidence in America\u2019s government. The financial crisis of 2007-09 dented faith in markets. America\u2019s failures in Iraq and Afghanistan undermined its claim to spread democracy. Today most countries refuse to heed its call to enforce sanctions on Russia. And China\u2019s rise has spurred American politicians to take a more selfish, zero-sum approach to geopolitics.\nChina\u2019s rise has also increased the threat of war. In a conversation with The Economist, Henry Kissinger, who will be 100 this month, warns that China and America are \u201con the path\u201d to confrontation. \u201cBoth sides have convinced themselves that the other represents a strategic danger,\u201d he says. The stakes could not be higher: both are nuclear-armed. Both are also dabbling with unpredictable artificial intelligence (ai). The elder statesmen\u2019s eldest statesman worries that, just as before the first world war, the superpowers will stumble into catastrophe.\nSince arriving in the Oval Office in 2021, Joe Biden has developed a new strategy to preserve American pre-eminence and reduce the risk of conflict. Jake Sullivan, the latest of Mr Kissinger\u2019s successors as national security adviser, recently gave the fullest account yet of this Biden doctrine. His narrative weaves together middle-class prosperity, defence and climate change. He repudiates the free-market \u201cWashington consensus\u201d and calls for the government to play a muscular role in society, with a strong emphasis on national security.\nThis means hyperactive industrial policy. Big subsidies will catalyse private investment in semiconductors and clean energy. Export controls will create \u201ca small yard and high fence\u201d to keep selected technology with potential military uses out of unfriendly hands. At the same time, the administration is softening its rhetoric. Instead of \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China\u2019s economy, it talks of \u201cde-risking\u201d. It wants to find common ground on climate change, African debt and even Ukraine. On May 10th and 11th Mr Sullivan spent eight hours with his Chinese counterpart, the first high-level contact for months.\nBehind the doctrine is a belief that a virtuous circle can make America and the world safer. State intervention and protectionism will boost industry, helping the middle class and cooling America\u2019s populist fevers. Less erratic leadership (after Donald Trump\u2019s) will restore America\u2019s authority abroad, even if the Biden team breaks a few global economic rules. The relationship with China will be managed with \u201cstrategic maturity\u201d. As a precaution America will keep spending large sums on its military forces to deter China from aggression. \nWill the new doctrine work? After the chaos of the Trump years, Mr Biden\u2019s commitment to diplomacy is welcome. It will be on display at the G7 summit this week. He is right that American foreign policy must deal with new challenges, from Chinese coercion to climate change. However, especially when compared with the post-1945 order, the Biden doctrine is flawed. Its diagnosis of America\u2019s problems is too pessimistic, and some of its prescriptions would make America weaker.    \nStart with the economy. Despite what many believe, America\u2019s economic power is not declining. With 4% of the world\u2019s people, it generates 25% of global output, a share unchanged since 1980. No other big country is as prosperous or innovative. As we noted last week, the size of China\u2019s economy is unlikely ever to surpass America\u2019s by much. The main source of America\u2019s strength is creative destruction and open markets in a rules-based global economy. So although Mr Biden is right to reinforce the social safety-net, his state-led, insular economic vision may ultimately erode living standards and American clout. \nThe Biden doctrine seeks to stabilise relations with an autocratic and paranoid China. In this task it is hampered by a second flaw: it muddles legitimate policies with America-first rule-bending. Mr Sullivan wants to combine export controls with co-operative trade, and an arms race with collaboration. But China\u2019s leaders think this strategy is meant to keep China down. America\u2019s case would be stronger if export controls didn\u2019t keep expanding, if Trump-era tariffs were not still in place and if its politicians were not vying to outhawk each other on China. The lack of agreement on trade makes everything harder. Never mind rules on ai, America and China have no system for nuclear-arms control: China\u2019s arsenal will almost quadruple by 2035. \nThe final flaw concerns allies. Mr Biden has backed Ukraine and revived nato and alliances in Asia. Yet America\u2019s unpredictable economic nationalism and unwillingness to offer access to its markets undermines its influence. Europe fears a subsidy race and worries escalating tensions with China will cause it severe damage: our calculations show Germany\u2019s economy is twice as exposed to China as America\u2019s is.  The decay of global rules is accelerating the embrace of a transactional approach to foreign policy by emerging economies. The post-1945 order rested on American constancy: each administration was guided by predictable interests. Today allies and enemies know chaos may follow the election in 2024. Trumpian dysfunction is not Mr Biden\u2019s fault, but it makes it vital to be predictable and open now.\nFree, open and predictable\nAmericans need to be persuaded that a more optimistic, positive-sum approach is in their interests. This is the key that will keep their country strong and unlock a better foreign policy, by allowing it to help forge new global rules on trade, climate, ai and more that old allies and new ones can rely on. Such a revived global order would be the best defence against an autocratic one led by China. Unfortunately the Biden doctrine fails to rebut the narrative of American decline and so has not resolved the tension between the country\u2019s toxic politics and its role as the linchpin of a liberal order. Unless America looks out at the world with self-confidence, it will struggle to lead it.\u25a0 \nFor subscribers only: to see how we design each week\u2019s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story
