Go to S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, Beijing in China, or many other cities across the emerging world and you find something similar. \u201cMost people only want to use UPI,\u201d says Govind, a seaside-snack vendor at Juhu, referring to India\u2019s fast-growing payments network. \nThe Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a platform that allows free and fast account-to-account transfers using fintech apps such as PhonePe or Google Pay. Unlike Alipay in China, it is open, so users are not locked into a single company and can take their financial history to competitors, notes Praveena Rai, the chief operating officer of the National Payments Corporation of India (NpCI), which manages the platform. And it is facilitated by QR codes or easy-to-remember virtual IDs.\nUPI is drawing attention from across the world. \u201cLook at what India has accomplished with the UPI, Aadhaar and the payments stack,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, has marvelled. Overall, it processed over $1trn in transactions in 2022, equivalent to a third of India\u2019s GDP. It was bolstered by the government\u2019s surprise \u201cdemonetisation\u201d of 2016, when multiple high-denomination banknotes were discontinued. UPI also benefited when covid left consumers scared of cash. It has grown from around 17% of 31bn digital transactions in 2019 to 52% of 88.4bn transactions by 2022. \u201cIndia leads the world in real-time digital payments by clocking almost 40% of all such transactions,\u201d Narendra Modi, the prime minister, has boasted.\nThe Indian model is inspiring others. Brazil\u2019s Pix, which facilitates bank-to-bank payments with a small fee, was launched in November 2020. It now accounts for some 30% of Brazil\u2019s electronic payments (credit and debit cards take up around 20% each). Such open instant-payment systems are an alternative both to the bank/card model in the rich world and to the closed fintech one in China. \u201cWhat we have shown is that it doesn\u2019t cost that much to move money if your network is well designed,\u201d says Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of the Indian tech giant Infosys, and an architect of India\u2019s \u201cdigital stack\u201d, including UPI. \nAn even bigger prize than efficiency is the chance to supercharge development. Raghuram Rajan, a former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, notes that digital payments generate real-time data on sellers\u2019 businesses and buyers\u2019 purchasing habits. That allows lenders or insurers to reach customers who may have neither the financial history nor enough assets to participate in traditional finance. As Patrick Collison of Stripe, a payments firm, puts it, \u201cThe provision of credit is more socially valuable the less legible the creditworthiness of the borrower.\u201d \nDigital development\nDigital forms of money have long been a source of progress in emerging markets. In 2007 M-PESA, a mobile-money service, was launched in Kenya by the telecoms giant Safaricom. Users give cash to designated agents to top up an account linked to their phone\u2019s SIM card. Payments are sent by SMS to friends, family or retailers. M-PESA is now used by over 90% of Kenyan households. It makes it much easier than before to send money to relatives over distances. Consumer spending tends to go up when money can be moved with less friction. Academic estimates suggest that M-PESA has reduced extreme poverty in Kenya by at least 2%. \nIn China Ant Group, which was spun out of Alibaba, an e-commerce giant, and its fellow payments firm, WeChat Pay, have largely digitised the payments business. Once the fintech behemoths have lured consumers, they can offer loans and other financial services, helped by algorithms that gobble up data. More than 90% of digital payments in China now occur on these two apps. Before the recent government crackdown, Ant was involved in over 20% of Chinese short-term consumer credit. But Chinese fintech firms have had several high-profile clashes with the government: Ant\u2019s planned flotation was blocked and the lending of fintech firms was forced to shrink. Yet Christopher Beddor of Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-based research firm, says the worst of the attack on tech is over. In December 2022 Ant won approval to raise $1.5bn in capital.\nThe Alipay model is being widely copied elsewhere. PayTM, an Indian fintech giant that listed publicly at a value of nearly $20bn in 2021, has tried to replicate Alipay by creating a similar closed fintech ecosystem in India. It counts Ant as one of its biggest investors. Grab and Gojek, two South-East Asian superapps, have pursued similar attempts at digitisation.\nThe benefits of digital finance tend to be bigger in emerging economies than in the rich world, says Saurabh Mukherjea of Marcellus, an asset manager. That is because people in rich countries already have access to most modern financial services through well-kept record systems, as well as assets that can be collateralised. The hope is that UPI and similar systems might now let some poorer countries leapfrog the West. The Indian government has given nearly all households a bank account in a scheme called \u201cJan Dhan Yojana\u201d that is making UPI far more accessible. New payments systems may even foster a credit boom. EY, a consultancy, says that fintech lending in India reached $270bn in 2022, up from just $9bn a decade earlier. This could be supercharged by the Account Aggregator scheme, which, like open banking in Europe, allows users to carry their financial history to a competitor.\nOpen payments systems may not produce another giant with the clout of Ant in China. Alipay charges 0.1% for withdrawals above a certain threshold. Retailers pay an average of 0.55% in transaction fees. Its lending division once made comparable revenues. That open payments reduce the likelihood of a similar Indian giant emerging is partly by design. \u201cWithout UPI we\u2019d get something like Ant without the tools to deal with it,\u201d says one Indian grandee, referring to the inability of the government to curb monopoly abuse.\nState support has been critical to the open platforms\u2019 success. Chinese fintechs thrived partly because of scant regulation. India\u2019s central bank has heavily promoted UPI, even requiring retailers above a particular size to accept it. It also mandates zero fees and subsidises participants. Brazilian banks are similarly mandated to offer Pix. Though it is not free, its fees average only around 0.2% for traders, compared with over 2% for credit cards.\nCompetitive advantage\nBoosters of India\u2019s system like noting that UPI promotes competition among fintechs and banks. Consumers want to use the most accepted payment systems; retailers similarly need access to the widely used. That is why card networks or closed systems often end up favouring a few players. Visa and Mastercard dominate the rich world, as Alipay and WeChat Pay dominate China, giving them huge market power. The architects of UPI and Pix see their models as breaking such a trend to concentration. \u201cWe see UPI as a public utility,\u201d says Ms Rai of NPCI.\nYet the state-led, zero-fee model has downsides. Indian bankers claim that a shortage of revenue has dissuaded banks and fintech firms from investing in consumer protection. \u201cThere are tech costs, maintenance costs, fraud and dispute costs,\u201d complains one. \u201cWhy would a financial firm incur all those expenditures when there\u2019s no revenue stream?\u201d asks Ajay Shah of the XKDR Forum, a think-tank in Mumbai. \u201cThis is a wake up call\u2026maybe the answer is to charge a little more,\u201d says Mr Rajan, the former RBI governor. \nMs Rai counters that UPI\u2019s zero cost boosts economic growth. The government compensated banks and some fintechs with just over 2,000 crore rupees ($250m) in 2022 as a subsidy for their public service in sustaining UPI. But that is a paltry 0.025% of the total value of transactions, and also far less than what it costs to run the UPI system, reckons one banker. Despite calls either to allow fees or to raise the public subsidy, India\u2019s 2023 budget will cut it by about 25%. \n\nCustomer protection has suffered. A survey by Renuka Sane, an Indian economist, and her co-authors, found that 18% of UPI users had some grievance with the system, such as fraud or a mistaken payment. Less than 30% have seen their complaints resolved. Uttam Nayak, a former boss of Visa in India, notes that, although UPI has rapidly growing volumes, the overall transaction value has not taken off as much. Consumers prefer safer payment methods for big-ticket items. \u201cI use UPI to buy chai. But I wouldn\u2019t use it for a plane ticket,\u201d says one architect based in Mumbai.\nThere are other flaws with UPI. Transaction success rates, a key metric that can encourage more spending, are lower than for payment systems in developed markets. Financial-data sharing, which promotes competition among banks and unlocks access to credit, has been slow to take off. Sahamati, an association of account aggregators, finds that the number of linked accounts has grown to 5m in April 2023. But that is small when set against India\u2019s vast population. \nDeveloping UPI will require more investment. Ms Rai notes that it offers a useful customer-acquisition channel for banks and fintechs that could benefit from its massive amounts of data. \u201cWe see digital payments as a way to onboard customers,\u201d says Harshjit Sethi, managing director at Sequoia India, a VC firm. \u201cThen you layer other financial services around them\u2026like the holy grail of lending.\u201d Sameer Shetty of Axis Bank, one of India\u2019s largest, says that \u201cAccount aggregator is where UPI was in 2017.\u201d\nBut such change can happen only if the fintechs are let in. BhratPe, one leading Indian fintech, has a lending licence. Others such as PayTM, Google Pay and PhonePe do not. Politics could get in the way. A paper from the RBI in August 2022 looked at fees for larger value payments. Insiders familiar with the NPCI, the RBI and the finance ministry say the first two are open to transaction fees, but the government has all but shut the door on the idea.\nNo instant-payment system is perfect, but UPI is a clear improvement on cash Will state-directed entities be able successfully to maintain such a technologically advanced payment system? \u201cWhat you want is for the market to churn rather than picking winners,\u201d says Mr Shah of the XKDR Forum. \u201cUPI was central planning.\u201d Even those who champion UPI see a need for multiple payment options. One grandee talks of \u201cconcentration risk\u201d. They note that \u201cIf NPCI goes down, then the whole payment system goes down,\u201d adding that there \u201ccould be a role for a second NPCI.\u201d\nNo instant-payment system is perfect, but UPI is a clear improvement on cash. In March the RBI launched UPI for feature-phones equipped with buttons, not touchscreens, which could expand access to the system. And it is spreading abroad. Already UPI is integrated with Singapore\u2019s payments system, letting people send remittances with a relatively low 3% fee. India wants UPI to become a payment option abroad, just as Alipay is widely accepted outside China.  Ms Rai says other countries may even adopt the entire UPI stack. Mr Nilekani hopes UPI will eventually be used everywhere. \u201cIf I go to Lulu in Dubai or Harrods in London, I should be able to make a payment with UPI.\u201d That would surely create new competition for the bank/card behemoths in the West.\u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "A payments revolution", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Special report"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/ak20usde603e242i79e6aq83sbjgoos9", "tegID": "ak20usde603e242i79e6aq83sbjgoos9", "headline": "Special report", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023-05-20", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/4jtv9bhqpenl2pjpma56dj397jbpo9ri", "type": ["PublicationIssue", "Report", "SpecialReport"], "headline": "Cashless talk", "subheadline": "Digital finance", "datePublished": "2023-05-20T00:00:00Z", "description": "The fight over payments systems is hotting up around the world.

Go to S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, Beijing in China, or many other cities across the emerging world and you find something similar. \u201cMost people only want to use UPI,\u201d says Govind, a seaside-snack vendor at Juhu, referring to India\u2019s fast-growing payments network. \nThe Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a platform that allows free and fast account-to-account transfers using fintech apps such as PhonePe or Google Pay. Unlike Alipay in China, it is open, so users are not locked into a single company and can take their financial history to competitors, notes Praveena Rai, the chief operating officer of the National Payments Corporation of India (NpCI), which manages the platform. And it is facilitated by QR codes or easy-to-remember virtual IDs.\nUPI is drawing attention from across the world. \u201cLook at what India has accomplished with the UPI, Aadhaar and the payments stack,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, has marvelled. Overall, it processed over $1trn in transactions in 2022, equivalent to a third of India\u2019s GDP. It was bolstered by the government\u2019s surprise \u201cdemonetisation\u201d of 2016, when multiple high-denomination banknotes were discontinued. UPI also benefited when covid left consumers scared of cash. It has grown from around 17% of 31bn digital transactions in 2019 to 52% of 88.4bn transactions by 2022. \u201cIndia leads the world in real-time digital payments by clocking almost 40% of all such transactions,\u201d Narendra Modi, the prime minister, has boasted.\nThe Indian model is inspiring others. Brazil\u2019s Pix, which facilitates bank-to-bank payments with a small fee, was launched in November 2020. It now accounts for some 30% of Brazil\u2019s electronic payments (credit and debit cards take up around 20% each). Such open instant-payment systems are an alternative both to the bank/card model in the rich world and to the closed fintech one in China. \u201cWhat we have shown is that it doesn\u2019t cost that much to move money if your network is well designed,\u201d says Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of the Indian tech giant Infosys, and an architect of India\u2019s \u201cdigital stack\u201d, including UPI. \nAn even bigger prize than efficiency is the chance to supercharge development. Raghuram Rajan, a former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, notes that digital payments generate real-time data on sellers\u2019 businesses and buyers\u2019 purchasing habits. That allows lenders or insurers to reach customers who may have neither the financial history nor enough assets to participate in traditional finance. As Patrick Collison of Stripe, a payments firm, puts it, \u201cThe provision of credit is more socially valuable the less legible the creditworthiness of the borrower.\u201d \nDigital development\nDigital forms of money have long been a source of progress in emerging markets. In 2007 M-PESA, a mobile-money service, was launched in Kenya by the telecoms giant Safaricom. Users give cash to designated agents to top up an account linked to their phone\u2019s SIM card. Payments are sent by SMS to friends, family or retailers. M-PESA is now used by over 90% of Kenyan households. It makes it much easier than before to send money to relatives over distances. Consumer spending tends to go up when money can be moved with less friction. Academic estimates suggest that M-PESA has reduced extreme poverty in Kenya by at least 2%. \nIn China Ant Group, which was spun out of Alibaba, an e-commerce giant, and its fellow payments firm, WeChat Pay, have largely digitised the payments business. Once the fintech behemoths have lured consumers, they can offer loans and other financial services, helped by algorithms that gobble up data. More than 90% of digital payments in China now occur on these two apps. Before the recent government crackdown, Ant was involved in over 20% of Chinese short-term consumer credit. But Chinese fintech firms have had several high-profile clashes with the government: Ant\u2019s planned flotation was blocked and the lending of fintech firms was forced to shrink. Yet Christopher Beddor of Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-based research firm, says the worst of the attack on tech is over. In December 2022 Ant won approval to raise $1.5bn in capital.\nThe Alipay model is being widely copied elsewhere. PayTM, an Indian fintech giant that listed publicly at a value of nearly $20bn in 2021, has tried to replicate Alipay by creating a similar closed fintech ecosystem in India. It counts Ant as one of its biggest investors. Grab and Gojek, two South-East Asian superapps, have pursued similar attempts at digitisation.\nThe benefits of digital finance tend to be bigger in emerging economies than in the rich world, says Saurabh Mukherjea of Marcellus, an asset manager. That is because people in rich countries already have access to most modern financial services through well-kept record systems, as well as assets that can be collateralised. The hope is that UPI and similar systems might now let some poorer countries leapfrog the West. The Indian government has given nearly all households a bank account in a scheme called \u201cJan Dhan Yojana\u201d that is making UPI far more accessible. New payments systems may even foster a credit boom. EY, a consultancy, says that fintech lending in India reached $270bn in 2022, up from just $9bn a decade earlier. This could be supercharged by the Account Aggregator scheme, which, like open banking in Europe, allows users to carry their financial history to a competitor.\nOpen payments systems may not produce another giant with the clout of Ant in China. Alipay charges 0.1% for withdrawals above a certain threshold. Retailers pay an average of 0.55% in transaction fees. Its lending division once made comparable revenues. That open payments reduce the likelihood of a similar Indian giant emerging is partly by design. \u201cWithout UPI we\u2019d get something like Ant without the tools to deal with it,\u201d says one Indian grandee, referring to the inability of the government to curb monopoly abuse.\nState support has been critical to the open platforms\u2019 success. Chinese fintechs thrived partly because of scant regulation. India\u2019s central bank has heavily promoted UPI, even requiring retailers above a particular size to accept it. It also mandates zero fees and subsidises participants. Brazilian banks are similarly mandated to offer Pix. Though it is not free, its fees average only around 0.2% for traders, compared with over 2% for credit cards.\nCompetitive advantage\nBoosters of India\u2019s system like noting that UPI promotes competition among fintechs and banks. Consumers want to use the most accepted payment systems; retailers similarly need access to the widely used. That is why card networks or closed systems often end up favouring a few players. Visa and Mastercard dominate the rich world, as Alipay and WeChat Pay dominate China, giving them huge market power. The architects of UPI and Pix see their models as breaking such a trend to concentration. \u201cWe see UPI as a public utility,\u201d says Ms Rai of NPCI.\nYet the state-led, zero-fee model has downsides. Indian bankers claim that a shortage of revenue has dissuaded banks and fintech firms from investing in consumer protection. \u201cThere are tech costs, maintenance costs, fraud and dispute costs,\u201d complains one. \u201cWhy would a financial firm incur all those expenditures when there\u2019s no revenue stream?\u201d asks Ajay Shah of the XKDR Forum, a think-tank in Mumbai. \u201cThis is a wake up call\u2026maybe the answer is to charge a little more,\u201d says Mr Rajan, the former RBI governor. \nMs Rai counters that UPI\u2019s zero cost boosts economic growth. The government compensated banks and some fintechs with just over 2,000 crore rupees ($250m) in 2022 as a subsidy for their public service in sustaining UPI. But that is a paltry 0.025% of the total value of transactions, and also far less than what it costs to run the UPI system, reckons one banker. Despite calls either to allow fees or to raise the public subsidy, India\u2019s 2023 budget will cut it by about 25%. \n\nCustomer protection has suffered. A survey by Renuka Sane, an Indian economist, and her co-authors, found that 18% of UPI users had some grievance with the system, such as fraud or a mistaken payment. Less than 30% have seen their complaints resolved. Uttam Nayak, a former boss of Visa in India, notes that, although UPI has rapidly growing volumes, the overall transaction value has not taken off as much. Consumers prefer safer payment methods for big-ticket items. \u201cI use UPI to buy chai. But I wouldn\u2019t use it for a plane ticket,\u201d says one architect based in Mumbai.\nThere are other flaws with UPI. Transaction success rates, a key metric that can encourage more spending, are lower than for payment systems in developed markets. Financial-data sharing, which promotes competition among banks and unlocks access to credit, has been slow to take off. Sahamati, an association of account aggregators, finds that the number of linked accounts has grown to 5m in April 2023. But that is small when set against India\u2019s vast population. \nDeveloping UPI will require more investment. Ms Rai notes that it offers a useful customer-acquisition channel for banks and fintechs that could benefit from its massive amounts of data. \u201cWe see digital payments as a way to onboard customers,\u201d says Harshjit Sethi, managing director at Sequoia India, a VC firm. \u201cThen you layer other financial services around them\u2026like the holy grail of lending.\u201d Sameer Shetty of Axis Bank, one of India\u2019s largest, says that \u201cAccount aggregator is where UPI was in 2017.\u201d\nBut such change can happen only if the fintechs are let in. BhratPe, one leading Indian fintech, has a lending licence. Others such as PayTM, Google Pay and PhonePe do not. Politics could get in the way. A paper from the RBI in August 2022 looked at fees for larger value payments. Insiders familiar with the NPCI, the RBI and the finance ministry say the first two are open to transaction fees, but the government has all but shut the door on the idea.\nNo instant-payment system is perfect, but UPI is a clear improvement on cash Will state-directed entities be able successfully to maintain such a technologically advanced payment system? \u201cWhat you want is for the market to churn rather than picking winners,\u201d says Mr Shah of the XKDR Forum. \u201cUPI was central planning.\u201d Even those who champion UPI see a need for multiple payment options. One grandee talks of \u201cconcentration risk\u201d. They note that \u201cIf NPCI goes down, then the whole payment system goes down,\u201d adding that there \u201ccould be a role for a second NPCI.\u201d\nNo instant-payment system is perfect, but UPI is a clear improvement on cash. In March the RBI launched UPI for feature-phones equipped with buttons, not touchscreens, which could expand access to the system. And it is spreading abroad. Already UPI is integrated with Singapore\u2019s payments system, letting people send remittances with a relatively low 3% fee. India wants UPI to become a payment option abroad, just as Alipay is widely accepted outside China.  Ms Rai says other countries may even adopt the entire UPI stack. Mr Nilekani hopes UPI will eventually be used everywhere. \u201cIf I go to Lulu in Dubai or Harrods in London, I should be able to make a payment with UPI.\u201d That would surely create new competition for the bank/card behemoths in the West.\u25a0", "description": "How emerging economies from India to Brazil built alternative payments models", "ogDescription": "How emerging economies
