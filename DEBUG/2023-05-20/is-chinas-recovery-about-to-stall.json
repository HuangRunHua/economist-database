Many of those aged 16 to 24, after all, are still in school or university and therefore not seeking employment. In recent years, their job prospects have nonetheless compelled attention and raised alarm. Last month, overall unemployment in China fell from 5.3% to 5.2%, according to figures released on May 16th. This improvement was overshadowed by a rise in youth unemployment to 20.4%, the highest recorded since the data began 2018.\nThe enormous attention paid to issues like youth unemployment is a symptom of China\u2019s emerging \u201cconfidence trap\u201d, argue Xiangrong Yu of Citigroup, a bank, and his colleagues. Even as the country\u2019s economic recovery largely surpassed expectations in the first three months of the year, investors seemed to focus on its \u201cweak links\u201d. These included lacklustre imports, soft inflation, the failure of manufacturing to match the strength in services\u2014and jobless youngsters. Foreign investors have soured on China as geopolitical tensions have risen: on May 17th the yuan slid past seven to the dollar. But \u201cpessimism is also significantly prevalent and persistent on the domestic side\u201d, the Citigroup economists note.\nIt is evident in China\u2019s stockmarkets, which have given up many of their gains from the initial reopening rally. And pleasant surprises in the economic data have barely registered in eeyorish fixed-income markets: government bond yields are only a bit higher than they were in the depths of the covid-19 pandemic. Although consumer confidence looks healthier than last year, it remains far below levels in 2019.\n\nChina\u2019s uneven recovery has so far failed to lift the mood. The danger now is that the mood will sink China\u2019s recovery. In April, for example, credit grew surprisingly slowly. Retail sales, though strong compared with April last year, when Shanghai and other big cities entered lockdowns, were weak compared with professional forecasts (see chart). Industrial production also fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations.\nInvestment by state-owned enterprises was reasonably strong, but spending by private enterprises was only 0.4% higher in April than a year earlier, according to Oxford Economics, a research firm. Part of the explanation for this disappointing growth can be found in China\u2019s property market, where a nascent recovery now appears to be in doubt. At the urging of the government, developers have prioritised completing unfinished building projects, rather than investing in new ones. Housing starts fell by more than 20%, even as completed floorspace grew by almost 19%.\nThe weakness in the property market has prompted some economists to reduce their growth forecasts for the year. Ting Lu of Nomura, a bank, cut his figure from 5.9% to 5.5%, for example. \u201cThe recovery has stalled,\u201d he explained, \u201cdue partly to Beijing\u2019s inability to boost confidence among consumers and business investors. As disappointment kicks in, we see a rising risk of a downward spiral.\u201d\nChina could seek to revive the recovery and confidence by easing monetary policy more forcefully. Inflation fell to only 0.1% in April, leaving plenty of room for stimulus. But since China\u2019s official growth target for this year is only 5%, the government may not rush to the rescue. Foreign investors and Chinese consumers do not have great faith in China\u2019s recovery this year. The government\u2019s unambitious growth target, set in March, suggests it does not have great confidence either. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and
