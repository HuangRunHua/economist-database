By Emma Cline. Random House; 304 pages; $28. Chatto & Windus; \u00a318.99\nAN OMINOUS mood sets in early in \u201cThe Guest\u201d and persists for the duration of this taut, tense novel. Alex, the story\u2019s 22-year-old protagonist, is not just down on her luck: she is completely out of options. Her work as an escort is not proving lucrative, and she is barred from many of the hotel bars where she used to pick up clients. She has been kicked out of her shared flat for stealing pills and failing to pay the rent. Simon, an older man\u2014he is a benefactor first, a lover second\u2014offers salvation in the form of a stay in his luxurious beach house for the summer. \nBut Alex is unable to make the good times last for long. High on painkillers, she crashes Simon\u2019s car; later she gets drunk and disgraces herself at a party. She is soon cast out of this home, too. She cannot return to the city (which city is not mentioned). She stole cash and drugs from Dom, an acquaintance, before she absconded, and he is violent and vengeful. \nAlex decides that Simon only needs some space and that they will reunite at another upcoming party. In the subsequent days, she survives using her charm and wits alone. She finds places to sleep and food to eat by adapting to the opportunities presented to her. She ingratiates herself first with a group of partygoers, then a kindly housekeeper, then a troubled teenage boy. \n\u201cThe Guest\u201d is a strong follow-up to Emma Cline\u2019s bestselling debut novel, \u201cThe Girls\u201d. Her prose is limpid and propulsive, sustaining an atmosphere of dread. Alex\u2019s broken phone offers a reprieve from Dom\u2019s constant messages, but it also means he could appear without warning. Ms Cline witheringly evokes her affluent country set: the \u201cdaughters of the rich\u201d were \u201cpitiable because, in the end, they could buy everything but beauty\u201d. \nUnlike Edith Wharton\u2019s \u201cThe House of Mirth\u201d, which chronicles a woman\u2019s narrowing choices and descent into poverty, \u201cThe Guest\u201d does not say how Alex came to be in this position. Her upbringing was \u201cordinary\u201d, so her self-destructive tendencies are not reducible to \u201csome logical equation\u2014x had happened to her, some terrible thing, and so now y was her life.\u201d \nThis can be frustrating for a reader hoping to understand Alex more fully, yet it underlines how adept she is at performance. By the end of the novel, Alex\u2019s sense of self has been eroded entirely. \u201cMaybe she was the ghost she had always imagined herself to be,\u201d Ms Cline writes. \u201cMaybe it was a relief.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter", "description": "The author of \u201cThe
