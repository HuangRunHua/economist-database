By Burkhard Bilger. Random House; 336 pages; $28.99. William Collins; \u00a325\nGermans born in the 1940s came of age in a shattered world. The Kriegskinder, or children of the war, inherited a country of ruins and silence. Cities were choked by rubble; millions of people were displaced.\nYet the recent Nazi past was rarely discussed. The breakneck post-war German recovery rested on a shame that, for many people, was too deep for acknowledgment. It emerged in subtle and unspoken ways nevertheless. One Kriegskind ascribed his lifelong fear of swimming to a memory of being strafed by Allied planes as he played in the River Weser. During the first Gulf war of 1990-91, some elderly Germans hoarded food and water, instinctively bracing for a conflict that was happening thousands of miles away.\nBurkhard Bilger\u2019s parents were part of that silent generation. In \u201cFatherland\u201d, Mr Bilger, a German-American writer for the New Yorker, reckons with the weight of Germany\u2019s Nazi past\u2014and his own troubling genealogy. His book tells the story of his maternal grandfather, Karl G\u00f6nner, a soldier, teacher and Nazi administrator in the small village of Bartenheim in occupied Alsace. Mr Bilger\u2019s search was prompted in part by the realisation that, as his mother and her siblings aged, he would soon lose his last living links to the war. \n\u201cFatherland\u201d evokes G\u00f6nner\u2019s upbringing in the Black Forest with aplomb. This, in Mr Bilger\u2019s telling, was a spectral landscape, almost medieval in its grinding, candlelit poverty. G\u00f6nner\u2019s family, in particular, seems haunted. His father, a drunken gambler, died by suicide; his mother saw spirits. One of their homes had been owned by a conjuror who studied the occult in a secret annexe. G\u00f6nner himself wanted to be a priest, but was drafted to the Western Front during the deadly final spasms of the first world war. A landmine killed his best friend in autumn 1918; G\u00f6nner himself went home \u201chobbled and half-blind\u201d. He carried that war inside him as Europe lurched towards the next.\nMr Bilger\u2019s central concern is the question of complicity. To what extent was his grandfather a willing participant in the Nazi war machine? The evidence appears damning. G\u00f6nner joined the National Socialists well after Hitler\u2019s expansionist ambitions and noxious anti-Semitism were obvious. As a teacher in occupied France, he was on the front line of the Nazi propaganda push: \u201cEvery lesson was an indoctrination, every field trip a political rally.\u201d As his grandson puts it, he served in \u201ca war fought with erasers and chalk\u201d.\nAs he digs deeper, though, Mr Bilger unearths a more complex picture. Like the Alsace region, which changed hands four times between 1862 and 1945, G\u00f6nner\u2019s biography splinters into a \u201cspider\u2019s web\u201d of conflicting loyalties. As a local party boss, he turned a blind eye to draft-dodgers, even as thousands of Alsatian men were sent to the Eastern Front; many perished in Soviet prisoner-of-war camps in appalling conditions. Tracked down during Mr Bilger\u2019s dogged reporting, G\u00f6nner\u2019s French students remember him as firm but fair. None was among the estimated 5,000 Alsatian children who died in Nazi facilities after being torn from their parents.\nOn balance, Mr Bilger exculpates his grandfather\u2014and, by emotional if irrational extension, himself. \u201cHis story belies the idea of irredeemable sin,\u201d he concludes. Though history often preserves the imprint of horror, he notes, the eddies of individual consciences are generally lost. Compared with this moral inquiry, the analogies Mr Bilger tries to draw with right-wing politics and anti-immigrant sentiment in contemporary America seem flimsy. The gulf between his grandfather\u2019s tale and today is too wide.\nThis is still a wonderful book. In a powerful passage, Mr Bilger takes part in a Familienaufstellung. Part-s\u00e9ance, part-therapy, these ceremonies encourage Germans to revisit moments from the past, so exorcising their tortured history. \u201cFatherland\u201d achieves a catharsis of its own.
