For a sobering analysis of this growing antagonism\u2014and a plan to prevent it causing a superpower war\u2014visit the 33rd floor of an Art Deco building in midtown Manhattan, the office of Henry Kissinger. \nOn May 27th Mr Kissinger will turn 100. Nobody alive has more experience of international affairs, first as a scholar of 19th-century diplomacy, later as America\u2019s national security adviser and secretary of state, and for the past 46 years as a consultant and emissary to monarchs, presidents and prime ministers. Mr Kissinger is worried. \u201cBoth sides have convinced themselves that the other represents a strategic danger,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are on the path to great-power confrontation.\u201d\nAt the end of April The Economist spoke to Mr Kissinger for over eight hours about how to prevent the contest between China and America from descending into war. These days he is stooped and walks with difficulty, but his mind is needle-sharp. As he contemplates his next two books, on artificial intelligence (AI) and the nature of alliances, he remains more interested in looking forward than raking over the past. \nMr Kissinger is alarmed by China\u2019s and America\u2019s intensifying competition for technological and economic pre-eminence. Even as Russia tumbles into China\u2019s orbit and war overshadows Europe\u2019s eastern flank, he fears that AI is about to supercharge the Sino-American rivalry. Around the world, the balance of power and the technological basis of warfare are shifting so fast and in so many ways that countries lack any settled principle on which they can establish order. If they cannot find one, they may resort to force. \u201cWe\u2019re in the classic pre-world war one situation,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere neither side has much margin of political concession and in which any disturbance of the equilibrium can lead to catastrophic consequences.\u201d \nStudy war some more \nMr Kissinger is reviled by many as a warmonger for his part in the Vietnam war, but he considers the avoidance of conflict between great powers as the focus of his life\u2019s work. After witnessing the carnage caused by Nazi Germany and suffering the murder of 13 close relatives in the Holocaust, he became convinced that the only way to prevent ruinous conflict is hard-headed diplomacy, ideally fortified by shared values. \u201cThis is the problem that has to be solved,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I believe I\u2019ve spent my life trying to deal with it.\u201d In his view, the fate of humanity depends on whether America and China can get along. He believes the rapid progress of AI, in particular, leaves them only five-to-ten years to find a way.\nMore on this:\nEight highlights of the conversation\nA full transcript\nOur daily podcast on the interview \n\n\nMr Kissinger has some opening advice to aspiring leaders: \u201cIdentify where you are. Pitilessly.\u201d In that spirit, the starting-point for avoiding war is to analyse China\u2019s growing restlessness.  Despite a reputation for being conciliatory towards the government in Beijing, he acknowledges that many Chinese thinkers believe America is on a downward slope and that, \u201ctherefore, as a result of an historic evolution, they will eventually supplant us.\u201d\nHe believes that China\u2019s leadership resents Western policymakers\u2019 talk of a global rules-based order, when what they really mean is America\u2019s rules and America\u2019s order. China\u2019s rulers are insulted by what they see as the condescending bargain offered by the West, of granting China privileges if it behaves (they surely think the privileges should be theirs by right, as a rising power). Indeed, some in China suspect that America will never treat it as an equal and that it\u2019s foolish to imagine it might.\nHowever, Mr Kissinger also warns against misinterpreting China\u2019s ambitions. In Washington, \u201cThey say China wants world domination\u2026The answer is that they [in China] want to be powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not heading for world domination in a Hitlerian sense,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not how they think or have ever thought of world order.\u201d \nIn Nazi Germany war was inevitable because Adolf Hitler needed it, Mr Kissinger says, but China is different. He has met many Chinese leaders, starting with Mao Zedong. He did not doubt their ideological commitment, but this has always been welded onto a keen sense of their country\u2019s interests and capabilities. \nMr Kissinger sees the Chinese system as more Confucian than Marxist. That teaches Chinese leaders to attain the maximum strength of which their country is capable and to seek to be respected for their accomplishments. Chinese leaders want to be recognised as the international system\u2019s final judges of their own interests. \u201cIf they achieved superiority that can genuinely be used, would they drive it to the point of imposing Chinese culture?\u201d he asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know. My instinct is No\u2026[But] I believe it is in our capacity to prevent that situation from arising by a combination of diplomacy and force.\u201d \nOne natural American response to the challenge of China\u2019s ambition is to probe it, as a way to identify how to sustain the equilibrium between the two powers. Another is to establish a permanent dialogue between China and America. China \u201cis trying to play a global role. We have to assess at each point if the conceptions of a strategic role are compatible.\u201d If they are not, then the question of force will arise. \u201cIs it possible for China and the United States to coexist without the threat of all-out war with each other? I thought and still think that it [is].\u201d But he acknowledges success is not guaranteed. \u201cIt may fail,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore, we have to be militarily strong enough to sustain the failure.\u201d\n\nThe urgent test is how China and America behave over Taiwan. Mr Kissinger recalls how, on Richard Nixon\u2019s first visit to China in 1972, only Mao had the authority to negotiate over the island. \u201cWhenever Nixon raised a concrete subject, Mao said, \u2018I\u2019m a philosopher. I don\u2019t deal with these subjects. Let Zhou [Enlai] and Kissinger discuss this.\u2019\u2026But when it came to Taiwan, he was very explicit. He said, \u2018They are a bunch of counter-revolutionaries. We don\u2019t need them now. We can wait 100 years. Someday we will ask for them. But it\u2019s a long distance away.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr Kissinger believes that the understanding forged between Nixon and Mao was overturned after only 50 of those 100 years by Donald Trump. He wanted to inflate his tough image by wringing concessions out of China over trade. In policy the Biden administration has followed Mr Trump\u2019s lead, but with liberal rhetoric. \nMr Kissinger would not have chosen this path with respect to Taiwan, because a Ukrainian-style war there would destroy the island and devastate the world economy. War could also set back China domestically, and its leaders\u2019 greatest fear remains upheaval at home. \n\u201cIt is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere\u201dThe fear of war creates grounds for hope. The trouble is that neither side has much room to make concessions. Every Chinese leader has asserted his country\u2019s connection to Taiwan. At the same time, however, \u201cthe way things have evolved now, it is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere.\u201d\nMr Kissinger\u2019s way out of this impasse draws on his experience in office. He would start by lowering the temperature, and then gradually build confidence and a working relationship. Rather than listing all their grievances, the American president would say to his Chinese counterpart, \u201cMr President, the two greatest dangers to peace right now are us two. In the sense that we have the capacity to destroy humanity.\u201d China and America, without formally announcing anything, would aim to practise restraint.\nNever a fan of policymaking bureaucracies, Mr Kissinger would like to see a small group of advisers, with easy access to each other, working together tacitly. Neither side would fundamentally change its position on Taiwan, but America would take care over how it deploys its forces and try not to feed the suspicion that it supports the island\u2019s independence. \nMr Kissinger\u2019s second piece of advice to aspiring leaders is: \u201cDefine objectives that can enlist people. Find means, describable means, of achieving these objectives.\u201d Taiwan would be just the first of several areas where the superpowers could find common ground and so foster global stability. \nIn a recent speech Janet Yellen, America\u2019s treasury secretary, suggested that these should include climate change and the economy. Mr Kissinger is sceptical about both. Although he is \u201call for\u201d action on the climate, he doubts it can do much to create confidence or help establish a balance between the two superpowers. On the economy, the danger is that the trade agenda is hijacked by hawks who are unwilling to give China any room to develop at all.\nThat all-or-nothing attitude is a threat to the broader search for detente. If America wants to find a way to live with China, it should not be aiming for regime change. Mr Kissinger draws on a theme present in his thought from the very beginning. \u201cIn any diplomacy of stability, there has to be some element of the 19th-century world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the 19th-century world was based on the proposition that the existence of the states contesting it was not at issue.\u201d \nSome Americans believe that a defeated China would become democratic and peaceful. Yet, however much Mr Kissinger would prefer China to be a democracy, he sees no precedent for that outcome. More likely, a collapse of the communist regime would lead to a civil war that hardened into ideological conflict and only added to global instability. \u201cIt\u2019s not in our interest to drive China to dissolution,\u201d he says. \nRather than digging in, America will have to acknowledge China has interests. A good example is Ukraine. \nChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, only recently contacted Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Many observers have dismissed Mr Xi\u2019s call as an empty gesture designed to placate Europeans, who complain that China is too close to Russia. By contrast, Mr Kissinger sees it as a declaration of serious intent that will complicate the diplomacy surrounding the war, but which may also create precisely the sort of opportunity to build the superpowers\u2019 mutual trust.\n\nMr Kissinger begins his analysis by condemning Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. \u201cIt was certainly a catastrophic mistake of judgment by Putin at the end,\u201d he says. But the West is not without blame. \u201cI thought that the decision to\u2026leave open the membership of Ukraine in NATO was very wrong.\u201d That was destabilising, because dangling the promise of NATO protection without a plan to bring it about left Ukraine poorly defended even as it was guaranteed to enrage not only Mr Putin, but also many of his compatriots. \nThe task now is to bring the war to an end, without setting the stage for the next round of conflict. Mr Kissinger says that he wants Russia to give up as much as possible of the territory that it conquered in 2014, but the reality is that in any ceasefire Russia is likely to keep Sevastopol (the biggest city in Crimea and Russia\u2019s main naval base on the Black Sea), at the very least. Such a settlement, in which Russia loses some gains but retains others, could leave both a dissatisfied Russia and a dissatisfied Ukraine. \n\nIn his view, that is a recipe for future confrontation. \u201cWhat the Europeans are now saying is, in my view, madly dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the Europeans are saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want them in NATO, because they\u2019re too risky. And therefore, we\u2019ll arm the hell out of them and give them the most advanced weapons.\u2019\u201d His conclusion is stark: \u201cWe have now armed Ukraine to a point where it will be the best-armed country and with the least strategically experienced leadership in Europe.\u201d\nTo establish a lasting peace in Europe requires the West to take two leaps of imagination. The first is for Ukraine to join NATO, as a means of restraining it, as well as protecting it. The second is for Europe to engineer a rapprochement with Russia, as a way to create a stable eastern border. \n\nPlenty of Western countries would understandably balk at one or other of those aims. With China involved, as an ally of Russia\u2019s and an opponent of NATO, the task will become even harder. China has an overriding interest to see Russia emerge intact from the war in Ukraine. Not only does Mr Xi have a \u201cno-limits\u201d partnership with Mr Putin to honour, but a collapse in Moscow would trouble China by creating a power vacuum in Central Asia that risks being filled by a \u201cSyrian-type civil war\u201d.\nFollowing Mr Xi\u2019s call to Mr Zelensky, Mr Kissinger believes that China may be positioning itself to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. As one of the architects of the policy that pitted America and China against the Soviet Union, he doubts that China and Russia can work together well. True, they share a suspicion of the United States, but he also believes that they have an instinctive distrust of one another. \u201cI have never met a Russian leader who said anything good about China,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never met a Chinese leader who said anything good about Russia.\u201d They are not natural allies. \n\nThe Chinese have entered diplomacy over Ukraine as an expression of their national interest, Mr Kissinger says. Although they refuse to countenance the destruction of Russia, they do recognise that Ukraine should remain an independent country and they have cautioned against the use of nuclear weapons. They may even accept Ukraine\u2019s desire to join NATO. \u201cChina does this, in part, because they do not want to clash with the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are creating their own world order, in so far as they can.\u201d\nThe second area where China and America need to talk is AI. \u201cWe are at the very beginning of a capability where machines could impose global pestilence or other pandemics,\u201d he says, \u201cnot just nuclear but any field of human destruction.\u201d\nHe acknowledges that even experts in AI do not know what its powers will be (going by the evidence of our discussions, transcribing a thick, gravelly German accent is still beyond its capabilities). But Mr Kissinger believes that AI will become a key factor in security within five years. He compares its disruptive potential to the invention of printing, which spread ideas that played a part in causing the devastating wars of the 16th and 17th centuries. \n\u201cThere are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable\u2026[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness\u201d\u201c[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness,\u201d Mr Kissinger warns. Despite the doctrine that a human should be in the loop, automatic and unstoppable weapons may be created. \u201cIf you look at military history, you can say, it has never been possible to destroy all your opponents, because of limitations of geography and of accuracy. [Now] there are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable.\u201d\nAI cannot be abolished. China and America will therefore need to harness its power militarily to a degree, as a deterrent. But they can also limit the threat it poses, in the way that arms-control talks limited the threat of nuclear weapons. \u201cI think we have to begin exchanges on the impact of technology on each other,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to take baby steps towards arms control, in which each side presents the other with controllable material about capabilities.\u201d Indeed, he believes that the negotiations themselves could help build mutual trust and the confidence that enables the superpowers to practise restraint. The secret is leaders strong and wise enough to understand that AI must not be pushed to its limits. \u201cAnd if you then rely entirely on what you can achieve through power, you\u2019re likely to destroy the world.\u201d \nMr Kissinger\u2019s third piece of advice for aspiring leaders is to \u201clink all of these to your domestic objectives, whatever they are.\u201d For America, that involves learning how to be more pragmatic, focusing on the qualities of leadership and, most of all, renewing the country\u2019s political culture.\nMr Kissinger\u2019s model for pragmatic thinking is India. He recalls a function at which a former senior Indian administrator explained that foreign policy should be based on non-permanent alliances geared to the issues, rather than tying up a country in big multilateral structures. \nSuch a transactional approach will not come naturally to America. The theme running through Mr Kissinger\u2019s epic history of international relations, \u201cDiplomacy\u201d, is that the United States insists on depicting all its main foreign interventions as expressions of its manifest destiny to remake the world in its own image as a free, democratic, capitalist society. \nThe problem for Mr Kissinger is the corollary, which is that moral principles too often override interests\u2014even when they will not produce desirable change. He acknowledges that human rights matter, but disagrees with putting them at the heart of your policy. The difference is between imposing them, or saying that it will affect relations, but the decision is theirs. \n\n\u201cWe tried [imposing them] in Sudan,\u201d he notes. \u201cLook at Sudan now.\u201d Indeed, the knee-jerk insistence on doing the right thing can become an excuse for failing to think through the consequences of policy, he says. The people who want to use power to change the world, Mr Kissinger argues, are often idealists, even though realists are more typically seen as willing to use force.\nIndia is an essential counterweight to China\u2019s growing power. Yet it also has a worsening record of religious intolerance, judicial bias and a muzzled press. One implication\u2014though Mr Kissinger did not directly comment\u2014is that India will therefore be a test of whether America can be pragmatic. Japan will be another. Relations will be fraught if, as Mr Kissinger predicts, Japan takes moves to secure nuclear weapons within five years. With one eye on the diplomatic manoeuvres that more or less kept the peace in the 19th century, he looks to Britain and France to help the United States think strategically about the balance of power in Asia.\nBig-shoe-fillers wanted\nLeadership will matter, too. Mr Kissinger has long been a believer in the power of individuals. Franklin D. Roosevelt was far-sighted enough to prepare an isolationist America for what he saw as an inevitable war against the Axis powers. Charles de Gaulle gave France a belief in the future. John F. Kennedy inspired a generation. Otto von Bismarck engineered German unification, and governed with dexterity and restraint\u2014only for his country to succumb to war-fever after he was ousted. \nMr Kissinger acknowledges that 24-hour news and social media make his style of diplomacy harder. \u201cI don\u2019t think a president today could send an envoy with the powers that I had,\u201d he says. But he argues that to agonise about whether a way ahead is even possible would be a mistake. \u201cIf you look at the leaders whom I\u2019ve respected, they didn\u2019t ask that question. They asked, \u2018Is it necessary?\u2019\u201d\nHe recalls the example of Winston Lord, a member of his staff in the Nixon administration. \u201cWhen we intervened in Cambodia, he wanted to quit. And I told him, \u2018You can quit and march around this place carrying a placard. Or you can help us solve the Vietnam war.\u2019 And he decided to stay\u2026 What we need [is] people who make that decision\u2014that they\u2019re living in this time, and they want to do something about it, other than feel sorry for themselves.\u201d\nLeadership reflects a country\u2019s political culture. Mr Kissinger, like many Republicans, worries that American education dwells on America\u2019s darkest moments. \u201cIn order to get a strategic view you need faith in your country,\u201d he says. The shared perception of America\u2019s worth has been lost.\nHe also complains that the media lack a sense of proportion and judgment. When he was in office the press were hostile, but he still had a dialogue with them. \u201cThey drove me nuts,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that was part of the game\u2026they weren\u2019t unfair.\u201d Today, in contrast, he says that the media have no incentive to be reflective. \u201cMy theme is the need for balance and moderation. Institutionalise that. That\u2019s the aim.\u201d\nWorst of all, though, is politics itself. When Mr Kissinger came to Washington, politicians from the two parties would routinely dine together. He was on friendly terms with George McGovern, a Democratic presidential candidate. For a national security adviser from the other side that would be unlikely today, he believes. Gerald Ford, who took over after Nixon resigned, was the sort of person whose opponents could rely on him to act decently. Today, any means are considered acceptable. \n\u201cI think Trump and now Biden have driven [animosity] over the top,\u201d Mr Kissinger says. He fears that a situation like Watergate could lead to violence and that America lacks leadership. \u201cI don\u2019t think Biden can supply the inspiration and\u2026I\u2019m hoping that Republicans can come up with somebody better,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great moment in history,\u201d he laments, \u201cbut the alternative is total abdication.\u201d \nAmerica desperately needs long-term strategic thinking, he believes. \u201cThat\u2019s our big challenge which we must solve. If we don\u2019t, the predictions of failure will be proved true.\u201d\nIf time is short and leadership lacking, where does that leave the prospects for China and the United States finding a way to live together in peace?\n\u201cWe all have to admit we\u2019re in a new world,\u201d Mr Kissinger says, \u201cfor whatever we do can go wrong. And there is no guaranteed course.\u201d Even so he professes to feel hope. \u201cLook, my life has been difficult, but it gives ground for optimism. And difficulty\u2014it\u2019s also a challenge. It shouldn\u2019t always be an obstacle.\u201d \n\nHe stresses that humanity has taken enormous strides. True, that progress has often occurred in the aftermath of terrible conflict\u2014after the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic wars and the second world war, for example, but the rivalry between China and America could be different. History suggests that, when two powers of this type encounter each other, the normal outcome is military conflict. \u201cBut this is not a normal circumstance,\u201d Mr Kissinger argues, \u201cbecause of mutually assured destruction and artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s possible that you can create a world order on the basis of rules that Europe, China and India could join, and that\u2019s already a good slice of humanity. So if you look at the practicality of it, it can end well\u2014or at least it can end without catastrophe and we can make progress.\u201d\nThat is the task for the leaders of today\u2019s superpowers. \u201cImmanuel Kant said peace would either occur through human understanding or some disaster,\u201d Mr Kissinger explains. \u201cHe thought that it would occur through reason, but he could not guarantee it. That is more or less what I think.\u201d\nWorld leaders therefore bear a heavy responsibility. They require the realism to face up to the dangers ahead, the vision to see that a solution lies in achieving a balance between their countries\u2019 forces, and the restraint to refrain from using their offensive powers to the maximum. \u201cIt is an unprecedented challenge and great opportunity,\u201d Mr Kissinger says.\nThe future of humanity depends on getting it right. Well into the fourth hour of the day\u2019s conversation, and just weeks before his birthday celebrations, Mr Kissinger adds with a characteristic twinkle, \u201cI won\u2019t be around to see it either way.\u201d \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "How to prevent a third world war", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Briefing"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/ig92fd080i1j2q35gel3sev1e8r72j9r", "tegID": "ig92fd080i1j2q35gel3sev1e8r72j9r", "headline": "Briefing", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/17/henry-kissinger-explains-how-to-avoid-world-war-three", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/ljr6qha8c5njtiqbn0u45vjmrjjcduc6", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Henry Kissinger explains how to avoid world war three", "subheadline": "One hundred years of inquietude", "datePublished": "2023-05-17T14:41:32Z", "description": "America and China must learn to live together.

In Washington they are adamant that China is scheming to supplant the United States as the world\u2019s leading power. For a sobering analysis of this growing antagonism\u2014and a plan to prevent it causing a superpower war\u2014visit the 33rd floor of an Art Deco building in midtown Manhattan, the office of Henry Kissinger. \nOn May 27th Mr Kissinger will turn 100. Nobody alive has more experience of international affairs, first as a scholar of 19th-century diplomacy, later as America\u2019s national security adviser and secretary of state, and for the past 46 years as a consultant and emissary to monarchs, presidents and prime ministers. Mr Kissinger is worried. \u201cBoth sides have convinced themselves that the other represents a strategic danger,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are on the path to great-power confrontation.\u201d\nAt the end of April The Economist spoke to Mr Kissinger for over eight hours about how to prevent the contest between China and America from descending into war. These days he is stooped and walks with difficulty, but his mind is needle-sharp. As he contemplates his next two books, on artificial intelligence (AI) and the nature of alliances, he remains more interested in looking forward than raking over the past. \nMr Kissinger is alarmed by China\u2019s and America\u2019s intensifying competition for technological and economic pre-eminence. Even as Russia tumbles into China\u2019s orbit and war overshadows Europe\u2019s eastern flank, he fears that AI is about to supercharge the Sino-American rivalry. Around the world, the balance of power and the technological basis of warfare are shifting so fast and in so many ways that countries lack any settled principle on which they can establish order. If they cannot find one, they may resort to force. \u201cWe\u2019re in the classic pre-world war one situation,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere neither side has much margin of political concession and in which any disturbance of the equilibrium can lead to catastrophic consequences.\u201d \nStudy war some more \nMr Kissinger is reviled by many as a warmonger for his part in the Vietnam war, but he considers the avoidance of conflict between great powers as the focus of his life\u2019s work. After witnessing the carnage caused by Nazi Germany and suffering the murder of 13 close relatives in the Holocaust, he became convinced that the only way to prevent ruinous conflict is hard-headed diplomacy, ideally fortified by shared values. \u201cThis is the problem that has to be solved,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I believe I\u2019ve spent my life trying to deal with it.\u201d In his view, the fate of humanity depends on whether America and China can get along. He believes the rapid progress of AI, in particular, leaves them only five-to-ten years to find a way.\nMore on this:\nEight highlights of the conversation\nA full transcript\nOur daily podcast on the interview \n\n\nMr Kissinger has some opening advice to aspiring leaders: \u201cIdentify where you are. Pitilessly.\u201d In that spirit, the starting-point for avoiding war is to analyse China\u2019s growing restlessness.  Despite a reputation for being conciliatory towards the government in Beijing, he acknowledges that many Chinese thinkers believe America is on a downward slope and that, \u201ctherefore, as a result of an historic evolution, they will eventually supplant us.\u201d\nHe believes that China\u2019s leadership resents Western policymakers\u2019 talk of a global rules-based order, when what they really mean is America\u2019s rules and America\u2019s order. China\u2019s rulers are insulted by what they see as the condescending bargain offered by the West, of granting China privileges if it behaves (they surely think the privileges should be theirs by right, as a rising power). Indeed, some in China suspect that America will never treat it as an equal and that it\u2019s foolish to imagine it might.\nHowever, Mr Kissinger also warns against misinterpreting China\u2019s ambitions. In Washington, \u201cThey say China wants world domination\u2026The answer is that they [in China] want to be powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not heading for world domination in a Hitlerian sense,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not how they think or have ever thought of world order.\u201d \nIn Nazi Germany war was inevitable because Adolf Hitler needed it, Mr Kissinger says, but China is different. He has met many Chinese leaders, starting with Mao Zedong. He did not doubt their ideological commitment, but this has always been welded onto a keen sense of their country\u2019s interests and capabilities. \nMr Kissinger sees the Chinese system as more Confucian than Marxist. That teaches Chinese leaders to attain the maximum strength of which their country is capable and to seek to be respected for their accomplishments. Chinese leaders want to be recognised as the international system\u2019s final judges of their own interests. \u201cIf they achieved superiority that can genuinely be used, would they drive it to the point of imposing Chinese culture?\u201d he asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know. My instinct is No\u2026[But] I believe it is in our capacity to prevent that situation from arising by a combination of diplomacy and force.\u201d \nOne natural American response to the challenge of China\u2019s ambition is to probe it, as a way to identify how to sustain the equilibrium between the two powers. Another is to establish a permanent dialogue between China and America. China \u201cis trying to play a global role. We have to assess at each point if the conceptions of a strategic role are compatible.\u201d If they are not, then the question of force will arise. \u201cIs it possible for China and the United States to coexist without the threat of all-out war with each other? I thought and still think that it [is].\u201d But he acknowledges success is not guaranteed. \u201cIt may fail,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore, we have to be militarily strong enough to sustain the failure.\u201d\n\nThe urgent test is how China and America behave over Taiwan. Mr Kissinger recalls how, on Richard Nixon\u2019s first visit to China in 1972, only Mao had the authority to negotiate over the island. \u201cWhenever Nixon raised a concrete subject, Mao said, \u2018I\u2019m a philosopher. I don\u2019t deal with these subjects. Let Zhou [Enlai] and Kissinger discuss this.\u2019\u2026But when it came to Taiwan, he was very explicit. He said, \u2018They are a bunch of counter-revolutionaries. We don\u2019t need them now. We can wait 100 years. Someday we will ask for them. But it\u2019s a long distance away.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr Kissinger believes that the understanding forged between Nixon and Mao was overturned after only 50 of those 100 years by Donald Trump. He wanted to inflate his tough image by wringing concessions out of China over trade. In policy the Biden administration has followed Mr Trump\u2019s lead, but with liberal rhetoric. \nMr Kissinger would not have chosen this path with respect to Taiwan, because a Ukrainian-style war there would destroy the island and devastate the world economy. War could also set back China domestically, and its leaders\u2019 greatest fear remains upheaval at home. \n\u201cIt is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere\u201dThe fear of war creates grounds for hope. The trouble is that neither side has much room to make concessions. Every Chinese leader has asserted his country\u2019s connection to Taiwan. At the same time, however, \u201cthe way things have evolved now, it is not a simple matter for the United States to abandon Taiwan without undermining its position elsewhere.\u201d\nMr Kissinger\u2019s way out of this impasse draws on his experience in office. He would start by lowering the temperature, and then gradually build confidence and a working relationship. Rather than listing all their grievances, the American president would say to his Chinese counterpart, \u201cMr President, the two greatest dangers to peace right now are us two. In the sense that we have the capacity to destroy humanity.\u201d China and America, without formally announcing anything, would aim to practise restraint.\nNever a fan of policymaking bureaucracies, Mr Kissinger would like to see a small group of advisers, with easy access to each other, working together tacitly. Neither side would fundamentally change its position on Taiwan, but America would take care over how it deploys its forces and try not to feed the suspicion that it supports the island\u2019s independence. \nMr Kissinger\u2019s second piece of advice to aspiring leaders is: \u201cDefine objectives that can enlist people. Find means, describable means, of achieving these objectives.\u201d Taiwan would be just the first of several areas where the superpowers could find common ground and so foster global stability. \nIn a recent speech Janet Yellen, America\u2019s treasury secretary, suggested that these should include climate change and the economy. Mr Kissinger is sceptical about both. Although he is \u201call for\u201d action on the climate, he doubts it can do much to create confidence or help establish a balance between the two superpowers. On the economy, the danger is that the trade agenda is hijacked by hawks who are unwilling to give China any room to develop at all.\nThat all-or-nothing attitude is a threat to the broader search for detente. If America wants to find a way to live with China, it should not be aiming for regime change. Mr Kissinger draws on a theme present in his thought from the very beginning. \u201cIn any diplomacy of stability, there has to be some element of the 19th-century world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the 19th-century world was based on the proposition that the existence of the states contesting it was not at issue.\u201d \nSome Americans believe that a defeated China would become democratic and peaceful. Yet, however much Mr Kissinger would prefer China to be a democracy, he sees no precedent for that outcome. More likely, a collapse of the communist regime would lead to a civil war that hardened into ideological conflict and only added to global instability. \u201cIt\u2019s not in our interest to drive China to dissolution,\u201d he says. \nRather than digging in, America will have to acknowledge China has interests. A good example is Ukraine. \nChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, only recently contacted Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Many observers have dismissed Mr Xi\u2019s call as an empty gesture designed to placate Europeans, who complain that China is too close to Russia. By contrast, Mr Kissinger sees it as a declaration of serious intent that will complicate the diplomacy surrounding the war, but which may also create precisely the sort of opportunity to build the superpowers\u2019 mutual trust.\n\nMr Kissinger begins his analysis by condemning Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. \u201cIt was certainly a catastrophic mistake of judgment by Putin at the end,\u201d he says. But the West is not without blame. \u201cI thought that the decision to\u2026leave open the membership of Ukraine in NATO was very wrong.\u201d That was destabilising, because dangling the promise of NATO protection without a plan to bring it about left Ukraine poorly defended even as it was guaranteed to enrage not only Mr Putin, but also many of his compatriots. \nThe task now is to bring the war to an end, without setting the stage for the next round of conflict. Mr Kissinger says that he wants Russia to give up as much as possible of the territory that it conquered in 2014, but the reality is that in any ceasefire Russia is likely to keep Sevastopol (the biggest city in Crimea and Russia\u2019s main naval base on the Black Sea), at the very least. Such a settlement, in which Russia loses some gains but retains others, could leave both a dissatisfied Russia and a dissatisfied Ukraine. \n\nIn his view, that is a recipe for future confrontation. \u201cWhat the Europeans are now saying is, in my view, madly dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the Europeans are saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want them in NATO, because they\u2019re too risky. And therefore, we\u2019ll arm the hell out of them and give them the most advanced weapons.\u2019\u201d His conclusion is stark: \u201cWe have now armed Ukraine to a point where it will be the best-armed country and with the least strategically experienced leadership in Europe.\u201d\nTo establish a lasting peace in Europe requires the West to take two leaps of imagination. The first is for Ukraine to join NATO, as a means of restraining it, as well as protecting it. The second is for Europe to engineer a rapprochement with Russia, as a way to create a stable eastern border. \n\nPlenty of Western countries would understandably balk at one or other of those aims. With China involved, as an ally of Russia\u2019s and an opponent of NATO, the task will become even harder. China has an overriding interest to see Russia emerge intact from the war in Ukraine. Not only does Mr Xi have a \u201cno-limits\u201d partnership with Mr Putin to honour, but a collapse in Moscow would trouble China by creating a power vacuum in Central Asia that risks being filled by a \u201cSyrian-type civil war\u201d.\nFollowing Mr Xi\u2019s call to Mr Zelensky, Mr Kissinger believes that China may be positioning itself to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. As one of the architects of the policy that pitted America and China against the Soviet Union, he doubts that China and Russia can work together well. True, they share a suspicion of the United States, but he also believes that they have an instinctive distrust of one another. \u201cI have never met a Russian leader who said anything good about China,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never met a Chinese leader who said anything good about Russia.\u201d They are not natural allies. \n\nThe Chinese have entered diplomacy over Ukraine as an expression of their national interest, Mr Kissinger says. Although they refuse to countenance the destruction of Russia, they do recognise that Ukraine should remain an independent country and they have cautioned against the use of nuclear weapons. They may even accept Ukraine\u2019s desire to join NATO. \u201cChina does this, in part, because they do not want to clash with the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are creating their own world order, in so far as they can.\u201d\nThe second area where China and America need to talk is AI. \u201cWe are at the very beginning of a capability where machines could impose global pestilence or other pandemics,\u201d he says, \u201cnot just nuclear but any field of human destruction.\u201d\nHe acknowledges that even experts in AI do not know what its powers will be (going by the evidence of our discussions, transcribing a thick, gravelly German accent is still beyond its capabilities). But Mr Kissinger believes that AI will become a key factor in security within five years. He compares its disruptive potential to the invention of printing, which spread ideas that played a part in causing the devastating wars of the 16th and 17th centuries. \n\u201cThere are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable\u2026[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness\u201d\u201c[We live] in a world of unprecedented destructiveness,\u201d Mr Kissinger warns. Despite the doctrine that a human should be in the loop, automatic and unstoppable weapons may be created. \u201cIf you look at military history, you can say, it has never been possible to destroy all your opponents, because of limitations of geography and of accuracy. [Now] there are no limitations. Every adversary is 100% vulnerable.\u201d\nAI cannot be abolished. China and America will therefore need to harness its power militarily to a degree, as a deterrent. But they can also limit the threat it poses, in the way that arms-control talks limited the threat of nuclear weapons. \u201cI think we have to begin exchanges on the impact of technology on each other,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to take baby steps towards arms control, in which each side presents the other with controllable material about capabilities.\u201d Indeed, he believes that the negotiations themselves could help build mutual trust and the confidence that enables the superpowers to practise restraint. The secret is leaders strong and wise enough to understand that AI must not be pushed to its limits. \u201cAnd if you then rely entirely on what you can achieve through power, you\u2019re likely to destroy the world.\u201d \nMr Kissinger\u2019s third piece of advice for aspiring leaders is to \u201clink all of these to your domestic objectives, whatever they are.\u201d For America, that involves learning how to be more pragmatic, focusing on the qualities of leadership and, most of all, renewing the country\u2019s political culture.\nMr Kissinger\u2019s model for pragmatic thinking is India. He recalls a function at which a former senior Indian administrator explained that foreign policy should be based on non-permanent alliances geared to the issues, rather than tying up a country in big multilateral structures. \nSuch a transactional approach will not come naturally to America. The theme running through Mr Kissinger\u2019s epic history of international relations, \u201cDiplomacy\u201d, is that the United States insists on depicting all its main foreign interventions as expressions of its manifest destiny to remake the world in its own image as a free, democratic, capitalist society. \nThe problem for Mr Kissinger is the corollary, which is that moral principles too often override interests\u2014even when they will not produce desirable change. He acknowledges that human rights matter, but disagrees with putting them at the heart of your policy. The difference is between imposing them, or saying that it will affect relations, but the decision is theirs. \n\n\u201cWe tried [imposing them] in Sudan,\u201d he notes. \u201cLook at Sudan now.\u201d Indeed, the knee-jerk insistence on doing the right thing can become an excuse for failing to think through the consequences of policy, he says. The people who want to use power to change the world, Mr Kissinger argues, are often idealists, even though realists are more typically seen as willing to use force.\nIndia is an essential counterweight to China\u2019s growing power. Yet it also has a worsening record of religious intolerance, judicial bias and a muzzled press. One implication\u2014though Mr Kissinger did not directly comment\u2014is that India will therefore be a test of whether America can be pragmatic. Japan will be another. Relations will be fraught if, as Mr Kissinger predicts, Japan takes moves to secure nuclear weapons within five years. With one eye on the diplomatic manoeuvres that more or less kept the peace in the 19th century, he looks to Britain and France to help the United States think strategically about the balance of power in Asia.\nBig-shoe-fillers wanted\nLeadership will matter, too. Mr Kissinger has long been a believer in the power of individuals. Franklin D. Roosevelt was far-sighted enough to prepare an isolationist America for what he saw as an inevitable war against the Axis powers. Charles de Gaulle gave France a belief in the future. John F. Kennedy inspired a generation. Otto von Bismarck engineered German unification, and governed with dexterity and restraint\u2014only for his country to succumb to war-fever after he was ousted. \nMr Kissinger acknowledges that 24-hour news and social media make his style of diplomacy harder. \u201cI don\u2019t think a president today could send an envoy with the powers that I had,\u201d he says. But he argues that to agonise about whether a way ahead is even possible would be a mistake. \u201cIf you look at the leaders whom I\u2019ve respected, they didn\u2019t ask that question. They asked, \u2018Is it necessary?\u2019\u201d\nHe recalls the example of Winston Lord, a member of his staff in the Nixon administration. \u201cWhen we intervened in Cambodia, he wanted to quit. And I told him, \u2018You can quit and march around this place carrying a placard. Or you can help us solve the Vietnam war.\u2019 And he decided to stay\u2026 What we need [is] people who make that decision\u2014that they\u2019re living in this time, and they want to do something about it, other than feel sorry for themselves.\u201d\nLeadership reflects a country\u2019s political culture. Mr Kissinger, like many Republicans, worries that American education dwells on America\u2019s darkest moments. \u201cIn order to get a strategic view you need faith in your country,\u201d he says. The shared perception of America\u2019s worth has been lost.\nHe also complains that the media lack a sense of proportion and judgment. When he was in office the press were hostile, but he still had a dialogue with them. \u201cThey drove me nuts,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that was part of the game\u2026they weren\u2019t unfair.\u201d Today, in contrast, he says that the media have no incentive to be reflective. \u201cMy theme is the need for balance and moderation. Institutionalise that. That\u2019s the aim.\u201d\nWorst of all, though, is politics itself. When Mr Kissinger came to Washington, politicians from the two parties would routinely dine together. He was on friendly terms with George McGovern, a Democratic presidential candidate. For a national security adviser from the other side that would be unlikely today, he believes. Gerald Ford, who took over after Nixon resigned, was the sort of person whose opponents could rely on him to act decently. Today, any means are considered acceptable. \n\u201cI think Trump and now Biden have driven [animosity] over the top,\u201d Mr Kissinger says. He fears that a situation like Watergate could lead to violence and that America lacks leadership. \u201cI don\u2019t think Biden can supply the inspiration and\u2026I\u2019m hoping that Republicans can come up with somebody better,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great moment in history,\u201d he laments, \u201cbut the alternative is total abdication.\u201d \nAmerica desperately needs long-term strategic thinking, he believes. \u201cThat\u2019s our big challenge which we must solve. If we don\u2019t, the predictions of failure will be proved true.\u201d\nIf time is short and leadership lacking, where does that leave the prospects for China and the United States finding a way to live together in peace?\n\u201cWe all have to admit we\u2019re in a new world,\u201d Mr Kissinger says, \u201cfor whatever we do can go wrong. And there is no guaranteed course.\u201d Even so he professes to feel hope. \u201cLook, my life has been difficult, but it gives ground for optimism. And difficulty\u2014it\u2019s also a challenge. It shouldn\u2019t always be an obstacle.\u201d \n\nHe stresses that humanity has taken enormous strides. True, that progress has often occurred in the aftermath of terrible conflict\u2014after the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic wars and the second world war, for example, but the rivalry between China and America could be different. History suggests that, when two powers of this type encounter each other, the normal outcome is military conflict. \u201cBut this is not a normal circumstance,\u201d Mr Kissinger argues, \u201cbecause of mutually assured destruction and artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s possible that you can create a world order on the basis of rules that Europe, China and India could join, and that\u2019s already a good slice of humanity. So if you look at the practicality of it, it can end well\u2014or at least it can end without catastrophe and we can make progress.\u201d\nThat is the task for the leaders of today\u2019s superpowers. \u201cImmanuel Kant said peace would either occur through human understanding or some disaster,\u201d Mr Kissinger explains. \u201cHe thought that it would occur through reason, but he could not guarantee it. That is more or less what I think.\u201d\nWorld leaders therefore bear a heavy responsibility. They require the realism to face up to the dangers ahead, the vision to see that a solution lies in achieving a balance between their countries\u2019 forces, and the restraint to refrain from using their offensive powers to the maximum. \u201cIt is an unprecedented challenge and great opportunity,\u201d Mr Kissinger says.\nThe future of humanity depends on getting it right. Well into the fourth hour of the day\u2019s conversation, and just weeks before his birthday celebrations, Mr Kissinger adds with a characteristic twinkle, \u201cI won\u2019t be around to see it either way.\u201d \u25a0", "description": "America and China must learn to live together.
