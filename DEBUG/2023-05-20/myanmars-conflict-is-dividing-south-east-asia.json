It was supposed to be a happy event to mark the opening of a new office of the dissident national unity government, which opposes the military junta that seized power in early 2021. The new administrative centre promised to bring a semblance of normality to the war-torn country: taxes would be processed and town meetings held. Then a fighter jet screamed overhead, dropping bombs. A helicopter fired rockets. At least 100 people were killed, including 40 children. Another day\u2019s work by the vicious junta of General Min Aung Hlaing.\nSince the Tatmadaw, as Myanmar\u2019s armed forces are known, ousted its elected government, more than 1.3m Burmese people have been displaced and over 30,000 killed in fighting between the army and its opponents. Nearly half of Myanmar\u2019s 54m people live below the poverty line, more than double the number before the conflict began. Just this week the Tatmadaw took advantage of the devastation wrought by a cyclone, which killed dozens, to launch yet more attacks on its enemies.\nSuch atrocities demand a regional response. Yet Myanmar\u2019s neighbours are paralysed over what to do about the conflict. This was illustrated at a summit of the ten-country Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Labuan Bajo, Indonesia, on May 10th. For the second year running, Myanmar\u2019s generals were not invited to the gathering of ASEAN leaders. The conflict was nonetheless prominently in mind; a few days earlier, a convoy carrying aid to displaced Burmese villagers, and also Indonesian and Singaporean diplomats, was attacked. Yet Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko Widodo, who is chairing ASEAN, declared that no progress had been made on asean\u2019s draft peace plan for Myanmar. Its conflict has become the regional bloc\u2019s gravest crisis since its founding in 1967.\nASEAN\u2019s members appear utterly divided over the issue. The more democratic countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore are more critical of Myanmar\u2019s junta than the authoritarian rest. A memo leaked after ASEAN\u2019s latest discussions confirmed that some countries want to invite the junta back to the club\u2019s meetings because \u201cthe time for isolation has served its purpose\u201d.\nThailand\u2019s ruling ex-generals, who also seized power in a coup, have coddled their Burmese counterparts. Thailand, which shares a 2,400km-long border with Myanmar, thus started separate negotiations with the junta late last year. Cambodia and Laos have done the same, straining unity around ASEAN\u2019s diplomatic boycott. China and India, Myanmar\u2019s giant neighbours, have also pursued their interests by engaging with the ruling thugs, thereby compounding the mess.\nChina has moved closest to the junta. Earlier this month Qin Gang, China\u2019s new foreign minister, became the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Myanmar since the coup\u2014it was his only South-East Asian pit-stop in an itinerary that also included India and Pakistan. These countries, notes Yun Sun of the Stimson Centre, a think-tank in Washington, are all strategic priorities for China. In Myanmar it aims to protect its investments and seek new ones.\nEconomic advantage, says Jason Tower of the United States Institute of Peace, is more important to China than ending conflict. So is strategic advantage. Myanmar affords China access to the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and an alternative to the choke-point of the Malacca Strait, the main route through which most of China\u2019s ship-bound energy and trade has flowed. China has poured over $21bn into a China-Myanmar Economic Corridor involving roads, railways, pipelines and a port.\nBeyond promoting China\u2019s economic projects in Myanmar, Mr Qin used his visit to advertise a Xi Jinping-era foreign-policy mantra\u2014\u201ccommunity with a shared future for mankind\u201d\u2014that puts economic development above individual rights (not that the junta cares about either). The Chinese foreign minister also rattled off other slogans to promote a world in which like-minded big powers such as China and Russia determine the security arrangements of their neighbours while rallying countries against the West. As China\u2019s influence grows and ASEAN\u2019s fragments, the interests of ordinary Burmese who want to attend town-hall meetings slide ever further down the ladder of regional priorities.\u25a0\nRead more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia:\nA winner has emerged in the old rivalry between Singapore and Hong Kong (May 11th)\nAmerica\u2019s closest Indo-Pacific allies are cosying up (May 4th)\nOn China, Japan\u2019s PM wants diplomacy, not war (Apr 22nd)\nAlso: How the Banyan column got its name", "description": "The region\u2019s leaders disagree on what to do about the conflagration.
