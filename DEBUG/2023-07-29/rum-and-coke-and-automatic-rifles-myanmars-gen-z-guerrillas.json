Resting their dummy rifles made of wood and bamboo against their legs, they sat on a fallen tree in the shade of a rubber plantation at the edge of the rainforest. The group was only a few days from finishing six weeks of basic military training; the notebooks in their laps were crammed with diagrams of attack formations and rules of engagement. \nTheir instructor called out: \u201cTo win the revolution we have to be good soldiers, you agree?\u201d \n\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d the group replied.\n\u201cBravery is not about killing people or destroying things or burning down houses,\u201d he told the students. \u201cBravery is about sacrifice, about giving yourself for others, about doing what you have to do under very difficult circumstances.\u201d  \nThe 99 young soldiers who make up the Albino Tigers \u2013 most of whom are between the ages of 17 and 28 \u2013 understand that their circumstances are tough. The battalion is part of the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF), a resistance army formed by the National Unity Government (NUG), a coalition of politicians, ethnic and civil-society leaders who oppose the coup staged by Myanmar\u2019s military generals in 2021. For the past two years, the resistance has been fighting a guerrilla war against the junta. Its goal is to force the army \u2013 which has ruled Myanmar for most of the past 60 years \u2013 out of politics permanently. It also hopes to ensure that the country becomes a federal democracy with equal rights for all, including women and ethnic minorities, who have long been brutally repressed. \nGeneration Z grew up thinking non-violent resistance could bring about social changeThe resistance has been surprisingly successful \u2013 it enjoys popular support and claims that, together with militias established by Myanmar\u2019s ethnic minorities who have been resisting the central government for decades, it controls half of the country. But because the PDF does not receive any foreign aid, its access to weapons and basic resources is limited. The communities that sustain its needs have been battered and impoverished by the military regime, and are themselves in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. \nFeeling that the rest of the world was forgetting their struggle, resistance leaders invited me to stay with the Albino Tigers for five days this spring. I became the first Western journalist to visit this stretch of the front line, near a vital motorway that connects Myanmar to India and Thailand. The Albino Tigers and other resistance forces have frequently carried out attacks on the junta here, even temporarily occupying strategic towns. The army has retaliated with fighter jets and helicopters provided by Russia and China, and heavy weaponry. It often commits atrocities, such as raping, dismembering and disembowelling civilians.\n\u201cWhat will the country be after we have won and bands of these guys are running around with guns?\u201dFor six hours I travelled with Captain Thu Saw, the gregarious leader of one of the three Albino Tiger companies, through rugged mountains contested by the junta and ethnic militias. Despite the dangerous surroundings, I found Thu Saw\u2019s camp \u2013 in territory controlled by the Karen, an ethnic-minority group \u2013 surprisingly peaceful. In the shade of tamarind and mango trees, the afternoon heat lingered, drawing crickets into song. Tiger-striped dogs lazed around, too hot to bark. In the valley, cream-coloured cows grazed on the dry stubble of last year\u2019s rice harvest. A soldier was tending a fire under a bubbling cauldron of rice while another chopped onions for a pumpkin curry. Off-duty soldiers washed clothes and oiled guns; some swung in their hammocks reading novels or watching Korean soaps on their phones. But the imprint of war was everywhere. The junta\u2019s mortars and airstrikes had snapped mature trees in half. The soil was pockmarked with craters and the remains of a bomb lay near the dug-out the fighters used as an air-raid shelter.\nOur safe arrival merited celebration. Thu Saw mixed rum with local cola and fetched his guitar. Under a solar-powered light he started playing \u201cKabar Ma Kyay Bu\u201d (\u201cTill the End of the World\u201d) \u2013 the anthem of the uprising against a previous military dictatorship in 1988, which was violently suppressed. During the subsequent decades, the song was censored, but everyone in the group knew the words: \u201cDo not waver,\u201d they sang. \u201cJust like our fallen heroes, who fought for democracy\u2026Let us stand strong in the revolution and resist\u2026The blood in the streets has not dried.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nWar seemed far away: the atmosphere was almost carefree, filled with Thu Saw\u2019s jokes and his soldiers\u2019 laughter. Cups were topped up and a pack of cards was produced. Suddenly, Thu Saw jumped up. He had heard a distant crackling sound \u2013 possibly one of the junta\u2019s mortars, which would mean that we had only about 30 seconds to make it to the shelter. Only two weeks earlier a bomb had landed 50 metres away from where we were sitting. \nThu Saw grabbed his walkie-talkie in case there was any information, but it remained silent; I listened carefully but heard only rolling thunder. Then raindrops started to fall \u2013 the first storm of the season. Attacks from the air are less likely when it\u2019s thundering. \u201cA good omen,\u201d said Thu Saw, chuckling, as his soldiers sighed in relief. \nMyanmar\u2019s youth \u2013 particularly students \u2013 have a long history of leading revolutionary movements, both through peaceful protest and military action. Yet the current generation of young resistance fighters is different. Their families had suffered for half a century under military rule. But in 2011 a decade-long experiment in hybrid democracy began and, for a time, Aung San Suu Kyi, a charismatic democracy activist, led the country. Generation Z grew up thinking non-violent resistance \u2013 promoted by Suu Kyi and other leaders in a bid to prevent further bloodshed \u2013 could bring about social change. Unlike previous generations, Gen Z also grew up with mobile phones and the internet. The political situation was far from perfect \u2013 especially for members of the persecuted Rohingya minority \u2013 yet many were filled with hope for the future. Universities flourished again, after years of closure. Those who had been exiled returned with new ideas and money.\nThe army has retaliated with fighter jets and helicopters provided by Russia and China, and heavy weaponry. It often commits atrocities, such as raping, dismembering and disembowelling civiliansThe coup in 2021 ended young people\u2019s dreams of a better life. Gen Z, especially women, spearheaded the protests. The army\u2019s crackdown forced those who managed to evade death or jail to flee for the border areas controlled by ethnic-minority militias allied with the resistance. Tens of thousands of young people then signed up for the PDF; many of the Albino Tigers told me they were motivated to fight after seeing their comrades die in front of them on the streets. Unlike their parents and grandparents when they were young, Gen Z has actually tasted freedom, and they are determined to get it back \u2013 at any cost.\nThu Saw has found it difficult to rein in his young fighters\u2019 battlefield ambitions. He is only about a decade older than most of his soldiers, yet has a markedly different outlook: \u201cThe only way to win is in a political way\u201d \u2013 meaning at the negotiating table \u2013 \u201cnot an army way.\u201d \nAlthough Thu Saw had always opposed the junta \u2013 he was once arrested for taking part in a satirical poetry recital in which he made fun of the generals \u2013 he was wary of fighting. Formerly a labour activist, he quickly organised a strike in protest at the coup. Forty young resistance activists then came to his door, begging him to join them, but he hesitated: \u201cI never wanted to be a soldier, shoot people, kill people. Then I saw a protester shot right beside me and I felt I had no choice. I have to defend my people.\u201d \n\u201cWhen I arrived, I was amazed. It was so crowded \u2013 so many young people. In the forest, I had got used to keeping my voice down. Here\u2026they were even playing guitar and singing\u201dAfter five months of hiding in the jungle, Thu Saw made his way to the PDF\u2019s main training camp, disguised as a snack vendor. \u201cWhen I arrived, I was amazed. It was so crowded \u2013 so many young people. In the forest, I had got used to keeping my voice down. Here\u2026they were even playing guitar and singing.\u201d He was put in charge of a company of Albino Tigers, whom he marched over the mountains and into the river valley (where I later joined them).\nKo Moustache \u2013 a lieutenant nicknamed for his facial hair \u2013 remembered that hazardous trek. \u201cWe had to walk day and night with very little food. Just some rice and fish paste, sometimes mushrooms we found in the forest.\u201d At 25, he was one of the older recruits; soon he was given charge of a platoon of 14 commandos. On one of their missions, Ko Moustache misjudged an attack on an army post and was shot and injured. \u201cWhen I realised that I was hit I ran as fast as I could down the mountain,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI left everything behind \u2013 my phone, the car, even love letters from my girlfriend.\u201d Afterwards, nearby villagers bought the resistance new mobile phones. The army also sent the Albino Tigers some old hunting guns with a sarcastic note thanking them for the valuable supplies they left behind \u2013 making clear that the junta does not see the resistance as a threat.\n\n\n\n\nKo Moustache used to work as a barista in a coffee shop; like most of his fellow soldiers, he is from one of Myanmar\u2019s cities. He dreamed of buying a house and starting a family. The coup dashed these hopes of a normal life. But though he had the opportunity to join his sister in England, leaving Myanmar was not an option: \u201cMy parents and grandparents lived many years in darkness and fear. I don\u2019t want this for myself and our future generations. I have no choice but to fight.\u201d His commitment is sometimes tempered by depression \u2013 he says he feels \u201clost\u201d when he thinks about his future \u2013 but he is able to commiserate with his comrades, who \u201chave become my second family. We can help one another.\u201d \nKo Moustache\u2019s girlfriend is also an Albino Tiger, and they often talk when they are both at the rear. War has given women a chance to challenge social expectations; PDF battalions include women not just as medics and admin staff, but as fighters. Ma Yu, a sniper in her 20s and a member of the Albino Tigers\u2019 ten-strong women\u2019s squad, told me, \u201cBefore they joined, some women had never worn trousers, only a htamein [a traditional sarong].\u201d\nNot all the Albino Tigers I met had wanted to become fighters; some had joined the PDF primarily for their own safety. At one point a soldier called \u201cComrade Federal\u201d gave me a cartoon he had drawn showing demonstrators in a city holding a flag emblazoned with \u201cGen Z\u201d and a three-finger salute. (The symbol comes from the film \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d, in which it is a sign of solidarity with the rebellion.) A ladder stretched from the city to the mountains, where soldiers were waving a PDF flag. Yet the ladder was broken \u2013 seemingly showing that, in Comrade Federal\u2019s view, there was no way for fighters to go back to their urban lives. I could sense that he struggled to put into words his feeling of being trapped. As a student-union leader at a major university, he felt he had no choice but to seek refuge with the PDF. All he really wanted was to finish his studies and return home to take care of his widowed mother. \n\u201cMy parents and grandparents lived many years in darkness and fear. I don\u2019t want this for myself and our future generations. I have no choice but to fight\u201dThu Saw was acutely aware of the stresses that his soldiers were under, and understood their doubts. He has already lost three Albino Tigers in battle, and knows that his jokes may not be enough to boost his soldiers\u2019 spirits. \u201cIf they want to go back to their families I will let them,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey are young, they don\u2019t want to kill people. My nightmare is that the PDF fighters are getting too used to carrying guns, to kill, to wound.\u201d (Indeed, there are cases of PDF groups going rogue and murdering civilians.) Thu Saw wondered, \u201cWhat will the country be after we have won and bands of these guys are running around with guns?\u201d\nOne morning I woke up early to soft chatter and strange rasping noises. Thu Saw was still asleep, rolled up in his hammock with his automatic rifle in his lap. I sneaked past him to see what the sound was.

three recruits to the Albino Tiger Battalion \u2013 a paramilitary group resisting Myanmar\u2019s junta regime \u2013 were studying the rules of war. Resting their dummy rifles made of wood and bamboo against their legs, they sat on a fallen tree in the shade of a rubber plantation at the edge of the rainforest. The group was only a few days from finishing six weeks of basic military training; the notebooks in their laps were crammed with diagrams of attack formations and rules of engagement. \nTheir instructor called out: \u201cTo win the revolution we have to be good soldiers, you agree?\u201d \n\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d the group replied.\n\u201cBravery is not about killing people or destroying things or burning down houses,\u201d he told the students. \u201cBravery is about sacrifice, about giving yourself for others, about doing what you have to do under very difficult circumstances.\u201d  \nThe 99 young soldiers who make up the Albino Tigers \u2013 most of whom are between the ages of 17 and 28 \u2013 understand that their circumstances are tough. The battalion is part of the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF), a resistance army formed by the National Unity Government (NUG), a coalition of politicians, ethnic and civil-society leaders who oppose the coup staged by Myanmar\u2019s military generals in 2021. For the past two years, the resistance has been fighting a guerrilla war against the junta. Its goal is to force the army \u2013 which has ruled Myanmar for most of the past 60 years \u2013 out of politics permanently. It also hopes to ensure that the country becomes a federal democracy with equal rights for all, including women and ethnic minorities, who have long been brutally repressed. \nGeneration Z grew up thinking non-violent resistance could bring about social changeThe resistance has been surprisingly successful \u2013 it enjoys popular support and claims that, together with militias established by Myanmar\u2019s ethnic minorities who have been resisting the central government for decades, it controls half of the country. But because the PDF does not receive any foreign aid, its access to weapons and basic resources is limited. The communities that sustain its needs have been battered and impoverished by the military regime, and are themselves in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. \nFeeling that the rest of the world was forgetting their struggle, resistance leaders invited me to stay with the Albino Tigers for five days this spring. I became the first Western journalist to visit this stretch of the front line, near a vital motorway that connects Myanmar to India and Thailand. The Albino Tigers and other resistance forces have frequently carried out attacks on the junta here, even temporarily occupying strategic towns. The army has retaliated with fighter jets and helicopters provided by Russia and China, and heavy weaponry. It often commits atrocities, such as raping, dismembering and disembowelling civilians.\n\u201cWhat will the country be after we have won and bands of these guys are running around with guns?\u201dFor six hours I travelled with Captain Thu Saw, the gregarious leader of one of the three Albino Tiger companies, through rugged mountains contested by the junta and ethnic militias. Despite the dangerous surroundings, I found Thu Saw\u2019s camp \u2013 in territory controlled by the Karen, an ethnic-minority group \u2013 surprisingly peaceful. In the shade of tamarind and mango trees, the afternoon heat lingered, drawing crickets into song. Tiger-striped dogs lazed around, too hot to bark. In the valley, cream-coloured cows grazed on the dry stubble of last year\u2019s rice harvest. A soldier was tending a fire under a bubbling cauldron of rice while another chopped onions for a pumpkin curry. Off-duty soldiers washed clothes and oiled guns; some swung in their hammocks reading novels or watching Korean soaps on their phones. But the imprint of war was everywhere. The junta\u2019s mortars and airstrikes had snapped mature trees in half. The soil was pockmarked with craters and the remains of a bomb lay near the dug-out the fighters used as an air-raid shelter.\nOur safe arrival merited celebration. Thu Saw mixed rum with local cola and fetched his guitar. Under a solar-powered light he started playing \u201cKabar Ma Kyay Bu\u201d (\u201cTill the End of the World\u201d) \u2013 the anthem of the uprising against a previous military dictatorship in 1988, which was violently suppressed. During the subsequent decades, the song was censored, but everyone in the group knew the words: \u201cDo not waver,\u201d they sang. \u201cJust like our fallen heroes, who fought for democracy\u2026Let us stand strong in the revolution and resist\u2026The blood in the streets has not dried.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nWar seemed far away: the atmosphere was almost carefree, filled with Thu Saw\u2019s jokes and his soldiers\u2019 laughter. Cups were topped up and a pack of cards was produced. Suddenly, Thu Saw jumped up. He had heard a distant crackling sound \u2013 possibly one of the junta\u2019s mortars, which would mean that we had only about 30 seconds to make it to the shelter. Only two weeks earlier a bomb had landed 50 metres away from where we were sitting. \nThu Saw grabbed his walkie-talkie in case there was any information, but it remained silent; I listened carefully but heard only rolling thunder. Then raindrops started to fall \u2013 the first storm of the season. Attacks from the air are less likely when it\u2019s thundering. \u201cA good omen,\u201d said Thu Saw, chuckling, as his soldiers sighed in relief. \nMyanmar\u2019s youth \u2013 particularly students \u2013 have a long history of leading revolutionary movements, both through peaceful protest and military action. Yet the current generation of young resistance fighters is different. Their families had suffered for half a century under military rule. But in 2011 a decade-long experiment in hybrid democracy began and, for a time, Aung San Suu Kyi, a charismatic democracy activist, led the country. Generation Z grew up thinking non-violent resistance \u2013 promoted by Suu Kyi and other leaders in a bid to prevent further bloodshed \u2013 could bring about social change. Unlike previous generations, Gen Z also grew up with mobile phones and the internet. The political situation was far from perfect \u2013 especially for members of the persecuted Rohingya minority \u2013 yet many were filled with hope for the future. Universities flourished again, after years of closure. Those who had been exiled returned with new ideas and money.\nThe army has retaliated with fighter jets and helicopters provided by Russia and China, and heavy weaponry. It often commits atrocities, such as raping, dismembering and disembowelling civiliansThe coup in 2021 ended young people\u2019s dreams of a better life. Gen Z, especially women, spearheaded the protests. The army\u2019s crackdown forced those who managed to evade death or jail to flee for the border areas controlled by ethnic-minority militias allied with the resistance. Tens of thousands of young people then signed up for the PDF; many of the Albino Tigers told me they were motivated to fight after seeing their comrades die in front of them on the streets. Unlike their parents and grandparents when they were young, Gen Z has actually tasted freedom, and they are determined to get it back \u2013 at any cost.\nThu Saw has found it difficult to rein in his young fighters\u2019 battlefield ambitions. He is only about a decade older than most of his soldiers, yet has a markedly different outlook: \u201cThe only way to win is in a political way\u201d \u2013 meaning at the negotiating table \u2013 \u201cnot an army way.\u201d \nAlthough Thu Saw had always opposed the junta \u2013 he was once arrested for taking part in a satirical poetry recital in which he made fun of the generals \u2013 he was wary of fighting. Formerly a labour activist, he quickly organised a strike in protest at the coup. Forty young resistance activists then came to his door, begging him to join them, but he hesitated: \u201cI never wanted to be a soldier, shoot people, kill people. Then I saw a protester shot right beside me and I felt I had no choice. I have to defend my people.\u201d \n\u201cWhen I arrived, I was amazed. It was so crowded \u2013 so many young people. In the forest, I had got used to keeping my voice down. Here\u2026they were even playing guitar and singing\u201dAfter five months of hiding in the jungle, Thu Saw made his way to the PDF\u2019s main training camp, disguised as a snack vendor. \u201cWhen I arrived, I was amazed. It was so crowded \u2013 so many young people. In the forest, I had got used to keeping my voice down. Here\u2026they were even playing guitar and singing.\u201d He was put in charge of a company of Albino Tigers, whom he marched over the mountains and into the river valley (where I later joined them).\nKo Moustache \u2013 a lieutenant nicknamed for his facial hair \u2013 remembered that hazardous trek. \u201cWe had to walk day and night with very little food. Just some rice and fish paste, sometimes mushrooms we found in the forest.\u201d At 25, he was one of the older recruits; soon he was given charge of a platoon of 14 commandos. On one of their missions, Ko Moustache misjudged an attack on an army post and was shot and injured. \u201cWhen I realised that I was hit I ran as fast as I could down the mountain,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI left everything behind \u2013 my phone, the car, even love letters from my girlfriend.\u201d Afterwards, nearby villagers bought the resistance new mobile phones. The army also sent the Albino Tigers some old hunting guns with a sarcastic note thanking them for the valuable supplies they left behind \u2013 making clear that the junta does not see the resistance as a threat.\n\n\n\n\nKo Moustache used to work as a barista in a coffee shop; like most of his fellow soldiers, he is from one of Myanmar\u2019s cities. He dreamed of buying a house and starting a family. The coup dashed these hopes of a normal life. But though he had the opportunity to join his sister in England, leaving Myanmar was not an option: \u201cMy parents and grandparents lived many years in darkness and fear. I don\u2019t want this for myself and our future generations. I have no choice but to fight.\u201d His commitment is sometimes tempered by depression \u2013 he says he feels \u201clost\u201d when he thinks about his future \u2013 but he is able to commiserate with his comrades, who \u201chave become my second family. We can help one another.\u201d \nKo Moustache\u2019s girlfriend is also an Albino Tiger, and they often talk when they are both at the rear. War has given women a chance to challenge social expectations; PDF battalions include women not just as medics and admin staff, but as fighters. Ma Yu, a sniper in her 20s and a member of the Albino Tigers\u2019 ten-strong women\u2019s squad, told me, \u201cBefore they joined, some women had never worn trousers, only a htamein [a traditional sarong].\u201d\nNot all the Albino Tigers I met had wanted to become fighters; some had joined the PDF primarily for their own safety. At one point a soldier called \u201cComrade Federal\u201d gave me a cartoon he had drawn showing demonstrators in a city holding a flag emblazoned with \u201cGen Z\u201d and a three-finger salute. (The symbol comes from the film \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d, in which it is a sign of solidarity with the rebellion.) A ladder stretched from the city to the mountains, where soldiers were waving a PDF flag. Yet the ladder was broken \u2013 seemingly showing that, in Comrade Federal\u2019s view, there was no way for fighters to go back to their urban lives. I could sense that he struggled to put into words his feeling of being trapped. As a student-union leader at a major university, he felt he had no choice but to seek refuge with the PDF. All he really wanted was to finish his studies and return home to take care of his widowed mother. \n\u201cMy parents and grandparents lived many years in darkness and fear. I don\u2019t want this for myself and our future generations. I have no choice but to fight\u201dThu Saw was acutely aware of the stresses that his soldiers were under, and understood their doubts. He has already lost three Albino Tigers in battle, and knows that his jokes may not be enough to boost his soldiers\u2019 spirits. \u201cIf they want to go back to their families I will let them,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey are young, they don\u2019t want to kill people. My nightmare is that the PDF fighters are getting too used to carrying guns, to kill, to wound.\u201d (Indeed, there are cases of PDF groups going rogue and murdering civilians.) Thu Saw wondered, \u201cWhat will the country be after we have won and bands of these guys are running around with guns?\u201d\nOne morning I woke up early to soft chatter and strange rasping noises. Thu Saw was still asleep, rolled up in his hammock with his automatic rifle in his lap. I sneaked past him to see what the sound was. A family was scraping the skin off a large pile of sugarcane; one member was dragging a cane press through the camp\u2019s gate. At noon they offered buckets of sweet, foamy juice to the soldiers. \nThu Saw later explained that villagers, grateful for the Albino Tigers\u2019 protection, \u201cbring us everything: rice, oil, vegetables, fruit. From the money I save, I buy weapons.\u201d At the beginning, his troops had only two guns between them; now they have 27. They often crowd-fund to buy guns on the black market. For other weaponry, they rely on Gen Z\u2019s ingenuity, adapting drones to drop bombs, and building mortars and grenade launchers, which, they boast, have resulted in hundreds of junta casualties. \nThe resistance wants to ignite a countrywide uprising later this year \u2013 \u201cbefore everyone gets too tired of the revolution\u201d, as one PDF commander told me. But no one seemed very optimistic about the resistance\u2019s chances in open battle, which would probably result in a bloodbath for both fighters and civilians. Even if the resistance triumphs, it will still face the immense task of repairing a country devastated by tyranny and war.\nConfronted each morning with the possibility of death, many PDF soldiers seemed truly prepared to sacrifice themselves for their cause. But I thought of something Ko Moustache had told me: \u201cI live day by day. After some time I realised that thinking about the future is of no use. The future will bring what it will bring.\u201d \u25a0\nIrena Long is an investigative journalist, broadcaster and photographer\nimages: Alvaro Ybarra Zavala, GETTY, REUTERS, STR, AFP", "description": "Young soldiers have buoyed the country\u2019s fight for freedom, but at great cost.
