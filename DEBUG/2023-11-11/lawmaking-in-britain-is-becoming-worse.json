The players roll dice and move counters as they steer legislation around Whitehall and through Parliament. They turn over cards revealing the hurdles of the system. \u201cForget to signify Queen\u2019s Consent. Go back 2 spaces.\u201d \u201cNew programme motion needed. Miss a turn.\u201d The first player to have their policy become the law of the land wins. \nAs with many family games, much of the procedure that governs Parliament is a product of custom rather than of iron laws. The rules can be bent. Corners can be cut. And that is what is now happening. Parliament\u2019s most vital job is to scrutinise legislation, and it is neglecting it. \n\nThis is no rubber-stamp body. The bills set out in the King\u2019s Speech on November 7th will not sail through unopposed. Prime Minister\u2019s Questions is as raucous as ever. Rebels still humiliate their leaders in late-night votes. But the theatre of confrontation obscures the fact that MPs spend increasingly little time on fine-bore examination of proposed legislation. Laws are too often driven through Parliament at speed. A swaggering executive at times treats scrutiny as an inconvenience. This is not just constitutionally objectionable. It also has practical costs. This is a story of how the machinery of lawmaking can start to fail, almost unnoticed. \nSome of the obstacles to thoughtful legislation are structural. Governments must pack lawmaking into a tight timetable. As a result, they are habitually resistant to accepting amendments to bills. The Cabinet Office\u2019s legislative handbook warns ministers that changes must be \u201ckept to a minimum\u201d since each will delay progress, note Jess Sargeant and Jack Pannell of the Institute for Government, a think-tank, in a recent report. For the same reason, the government usually balks at publishing draft bills before the parliamentary process begins. Since 1997 an average of only one in eight bills per session has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny, finds Ms Sargeant.\nA second problem lies with bill committees, which are meant to hear evidence and undertake line-by-line scrutiny of bills as they make their way through Parliament. Many MPs regard them as a form of drudgery; independent-minded ones with a real interest in the proposed law are unlikely to be picked by party whips. The resulting debate is partisan and cursory. Major constitutional bills, and some others, are by convention heard in a \u201ccommittee of the whole house\u201d in the main chamber. That allows all MPs to have a say but is bad for close textual scrutiny. Across 177 bills between 2015 and 2021, 73% of them were subject to no oral-evidence hearings at all. \nThese long-standing problems have been compounded by other trends (see charts). Parliament produces more legislation than ever: the volume of acts and statutory instruments grew from 760 pages in 1911 to over 15,200 by 2009, when the data series ends (perhaps the printer jammed). Regulatory regimes for immigration and welfare have grown more complex. Brexit landed Westminster with responsibility for dense EU rule books.\nYet the House of Commons is trying to do more in less time. It was sitting for 173 days in 1988 but only 147 days in 2021. The average sitting day has shrunk from nine hours and four minutes to seven hours and 37 minutes over the same period, in part owing to sensible reforms to make the place more family-friendly. \nThese shorter hours are also being used differently. The share of time spent on government legislation in the chamber fell from a recent-era peak of 41% in 2005-06 to 20% in the most recent session to June. Urgent questions\u2014a procedure whereby a minister is summoned to Parliament at once, almost always to comment on the day\u2019s headlines\u2014have exploded, from four in 2007-08 to 104 in 2021-22. A greater share of time is spent on Westminster Hall debates, non-legislative sessions for MPs to air their pet causes.\nThe f\u00eate of the nation\nMPs\u2019 jobs have come to resemble those of \u201csuper councillors\u201d, lobbying for their constituencies, rather than legislators with their mind on the national picture. In 2017 the Hansard Society, a research outfit focused on Parliament, polled the public to ask what they thought MPs should do with their time. \u201cMaking laws\u201d came eighth, below \u201crepresenting the views of local people in the House of Commons\u201d and \u201cparticipating in local public meetings and events\u201d. Between 2010 and 2019, the proportion of MPs representing a constituency in the region of their birth rose from 45% to 52%, including 60% of those newly elected in 2019.  \nChanges in the media landscape mean that ambitious MPs get less recognition for scrutinising legislation than their predecessors did. Until two decades ago, many broadsheets had a \u201cyesterday in Parliament\u201d page written by full-time \u201cgallery\u201d reporters. Now attention is focused elsewhere. \u201cThe incentive structure is misaligned,\u201d says Ruth Fox of the Hansard Society, who reckons that MPs don\u2019t get any credit or benefit in the constituency for being a good scrutineer of legislation. \nPoliticians also lack expert support. MPs\u2019 staffing budgets are intended to fund four full-time assistants, with pay for the most senior capped at \u00a356,312 ($69,000). Many are young; turnover is high. In America\u2019s Congress, a representative can employ up to 18 full-time staff, often including legislative specialists. Members of the House of Lords have no paid personal researchers at all. \nThis weakening system of scrutiny has been hit by two great shocks. Brexit meant that the government needed to race against time to rewrite the statute book to get ready for separation from the EU. Covid-19 forced lawmakers to move even faster. \nFew dispute that speed was necessary. But the Brexit referendum introduced a shrill and aggressive politics that treated parliamentary scrutiny not as a service to voters, but as a betrayal of them. And there is growing concern, certainly among senior members of the House of Lords, that ways of legislating in times of crisis have become a new modus operandi. Civil servants, too, say that covid and Brexit have altered ministers\u2019 expectations about the time needed to properly draft a bill. A generation of MPs elected since 2015 knows little different. \n\u201cFor three years at least ministers seem to have regarded legislation as a series of party political broadcasts,\u201d says Lord Lisvane, formerly the most senior clerk in the House of Commons. A committee of cabinet ministers, chaired by the Leader of the Commons, is tasked with vetting draft laws before they enter the system. \u201cBut it seems a very soft touch these days. Ministers simply aren\u2019t put in the dock about their legislative aspirations,\u201d he says. \nIn recent years a growing number of bills have completed their main Commons stages (the second and third readings) in a single day, almost eliminating the chance for meaningful scrutiny. Some instances of haste were justifiable: to pass covid legislation or to change the royal household after the death of the queen. \nOthers were less excusable. The Energy Prices Act, dashed out by Liz Truss\u2019s government in 2022, underpinned a \u00a378bn programme of universal household and business subsidies. Analysts and MPs had proposed much cheaper targeted designs, but the Tory leadership contest that summer crowded out proper policy work. The act implementing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit trade agreement cleared the Commons and Lords in a single day on December 30th 2020; in contrast, ratification of the Maastricht treaty of 1992 was considered over a period of more than 400 days.\nAs a result of this haste, the details of laws are being worked out later in the process. In particular, ministers are asking for ever-broader powers today that will let them make policy tomorrow. Secondary legislation is law created by ministers through regulations known as \u201cstatutory instruments\u201d, and made under powers given to them by an act of Parliament. Conventionally, primary legislation is used to set policy (such as a new criminal offence) and secondary legislation to guide its implementation (such as setting the level of fines). But the boundaries are not precisely defined. The growing use of secondary legislation prompted the House of Lords in 2021 to warn that \u201cgovernment by diktat\u201d was leaching power from Parliament. \n\n\u201cSkeleton bills\u201d, which provide ministers with the framework powers to make a policy, but few clues as to what it will be in practice, were essential in the Brexit years as ministers prepared to take on old EU powers in areas such as fishing and chemicals. But their usage has become part of a pattern. The Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act, a law intended to keep trains and schools running during industrial disputes, was \u201calmost so skeletal that we wonder if bits of the bones were stolen away by wild animals and buried somewhere\u201d, declared Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Tory MP. \nSkeleton bills often depend on \u201cHenry VIII\u201d powers, named for the Tudor king\u2019s habit of governing by proclamation. These are clauses which state that ministers can amend past, or even future, acts of Parliament by issuing secondary legislation. Lord Judge, a former head of the judiciary, declared in a recent speech that they have become so common that \u201cwhen an act of Parliament omits a Henry VIII clause it is only because someone in the department has failed to press the relevant button on the computer.\u201d \nLord Blencathra, a former Tory minister, complains that since Brexit departmental lawyers have been \u201ctacking them on to tiddly little bills\u201d on the basis of \u201cjust in case\u201d. A bill now before Parliament, intended to prevent public bodies from engaging in boycotts of Britain\u2019s allies, contains five Henry VIII clauses. The Online Safety Act contains more than 20. Individually, these clauses may be justifiable; collectively, they point to a government seeking shortcuts in the legislative process. \nStatutory instruments get even less scrutiny than primary legislation. They are presented to Parliament and sifted by committees of lawmakers, but debates on them can last just minutes or seconds. They cannot be amended, but only voted down, which is rare. The last time the House of Commons blocked a statutory instrument was in 1979; the House of Lords last did so in 2015. The legal commitment to hit net zero by 2050, made in 2019, is likely to be the most expensive policy decision Britain will take this century. It was set by a statutory instrument after a 90-minute debate in the Commons and without a vote there, using a mechanism created in the Climate Change Act of 2008. \nUnder a procedure called \u201cmade affirmative\u201d, some statutory instruments become law as soon as a minister signs them; lawmakers vote on them later. The Economist\u2019s review of parliamentary data shows that this technique has been used far more liberally recently\u2014from 1.8% of the statutory instruments in 1997-2019 to 8.1% in 2019-22. Covid is mostly to blame.\nAll this haste is leading to less informed decisions. MPs often pass legislation with no idea as to its costs or benefits. Many impact assessments, which are meant to quantify the expected effects of proposed statutory instruments, \u201cappear to have been scrambled together at the last minute to justify a decision already taken\u201d, concluded a recent House of Lords report. The Home Office\u2019s impact assessment on the Illegal Migration Bill revealed that deporting a person to Rwanda would cost \u00a3169,000 and would only be cost-effective if many thousands of people were deterred. But it was not published until June 26th, two months after it had cleared the Commons. \nErrors are also rising. Some 11% of the statutory instruments laid in the 2022-23 session of Parliament were to correct previous drafting mistakes, more than double the 5% threshold that the House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee considers acceptable for human error. \u201cThe real problem is that this is such a convenient way of doing things,\u201d says Lord Thomas, a former Lord Chief Justice who sits on the committee. \u201cAnd when you do something because it\u2019s convenient, that is what really ought to cause you to worry.\u201d\n\nGood scrutiny has historically depended on the interplay between the House of Commons, which takes the lead on setting policy, and the unelected House of Lords, which has focused on revising and fine-tuning legislation. Many members of the upper house feel that they are doing the basic scrutiny that the Commons is shirking, and that the government pays their work less heed.

Sometimes they succeed in forcing a reversal. More often the amendments are thrown out when a bill returns to the Commons and have no impact. \nStrikingly few Conservative MPs are animated by how the rules of the parliamentary board game are being forgotten. But should an election force them into opposition, the costs of a weakened Parliament will be more obvious to them. Labour Party officials insist they will restore discipline to the process. But a Labour government would inherit a statute book packed with powers that could prove rather useful to ministers in a hurry. \nTake the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act, passed earlier this year, which creates wide-ranging powers for ministers to rewrite regulations that predated Brexit. Its neo-Thatcherite architects hoped it would ignite a deregulatory Big Bang. But it might as easily be used to strengthen trade-union rights or realign policies with those of the EU. \u201cThese powers could sit there for decades, being used by governments who may take an entirely different approach,\u201d says Dr Fox. \u201cThat does not seem to compute at all with ministers.\u201d The rules of the legislative game exist for the benefit of all the players.

"url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/07/lawmaking-in-britain-is-becoming-worse", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "When civil servants in Britain first learn about how laws are made, they are given a board game. \u201cLegislate?!\u201d was devised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, which drafts government legislation. The players roll dice and move counters as they steer legislation around Whitehall and through Parliament. They turn over cards revealing the hurdles of the system. \u201cForget to signify Queen\u2019s Consent. Go back 2 spaces.\u201d \u201cNew programme motion needed. Miss a turn.\u201d The first player to have their policy become the law of the land wins. \nAs with many family games, much of the procedure that governs Parliament is a product of custom rather than of iron laws. The rules can be bent. Corners can be cut. And that is what is now happening. Parliament\u2019s most vital job is to scrutinise legislation, and it is neglecting it. \n\nThis is no rubber-stamp body. The bills set out in the King\u2019s Speech on November 7th will not sail through unopposed. Prime Minister\u2019s Questions is as raucous as ever. Rebels still humiliate their leaders in late-night votes. But the theatre of confrontation obscures the fact that MPs spend increasingly little time on fine-bore examination of proposed legislation. Laws are too often driven through Parliament at speed. A swaggering executive at times treats scrutiny as an inconvenience. This is not just constitutionally objectionable. It also has practical costs. This is a story of how the machinery of lawmaking can start to fail, almost unnoticed. \nSome of the obstacles to thoughtful legislation are structural. Governments must pack lawmaking into a tight timetable. As a result, they are habitually resistant to accepting amendments to bills. The Cabinet Office\u2019s legislative handbook warns ministers that changes must be \u201ckept to a minimum\u201d since each will delay progress, note Jess Sargeant and Jack Pannell of the Institute for Government, a think-tank, in a recent report. For the same reason, the government usually balks at publishing draft bills before the parliamentary process begins. Since 1997 an average of only one in eight bills per session has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny, finds Ms Sargeant.\nA second problem lies with bill committees, which are meant to hear evidence and undertake line-by-line scrutiny of bills as they make their way through Parliament. Many MPs regard them as a form of drudgery; independent-minded ones with a real interest in the proposed law are unlikely to be picked by party whips. The resulting debate is partisan and cursory. Major constitutional bills, and some others, are by convention heard in a \u201ccommittee of the whole house\u201d in the main chamber. That allows all MPs to have a say but is bad for close textual scrutiny. Across 177 bills between 2015 and 2021, 73% of them were subject to no oral-evidence hearings at all. \nThese long-standing problems have been compounded by other trends (see charts). Parliament produces more legislation than ever: the volume of acts and statutory instruments grew from 760 pages in 1911 to over 15,200 by 2009, when the data series ends (perhaps the printer jammed). Regulatory regimes for immigration and welfare have grown more complex. Brexit landed Westminster with responsibility for dense EU rule books.\nYet the House of Commons is trying to do more in less time. It was sitting for 173 days in 1988 but only 147 days in 2021. The average sitting day has shrunk from nine hours and four minutes to seven hours and 37 minutes over the same period, in part owing to sensible reforms to make the place more family-friendly. \nThese shorter hours are also being used differently. The share of time spent on government legislation in the chamber fell from a recent-era peak of 41% in 2005-06 to 20% in the most recent session to June. Urgent questions\u2014a procedure whereby a minister is summoned to Parliament at once, almost always to comment on the day\u2019s headlines\u2014have exploded, from four in 2007-08 to 104 in 2021-22. A greater share of time is spent on Westminster Hall debates, non-legislative sessions for MPs to air their pet causes.\nThe f\u00eate of the nation\nMPs\u2019 jobs have come to resemble those of \u201csuper councillors\u201d, lobbying for their constituencies, rather than legislators with their mind on the national picture. In 2017 the Hansard Society, a research outfit focused on Parliament, polled the public to ask what they thought MPs should do with their time. \u201cMaking laws\u201d came eighth, below \u201crepresenting the views of local people in the House of Commons\u201d and \u201cparticipating in local public meetings and events\u201d. Between 2010 and 2019, the proportion of MPs representing a constituency in the region of their birth rose from 45% to 52%, including 60% of those newly elected in 2019.  \nChanges in the media landscape mean that ambitious MPs get less recognition for scrutinising legislation than their predecessors did. Until two decades ago, many broadsheets had a \u201cyesterday in Parliament\u201d page written by full-time \u201cgallery\u201d reporters. Now attention is focused elsewhere. \u201cThe incentive structure is misaligned,\u201d says Ruth Fox of the Hansard Society, who reckons that MPs don\u2019t get any credit or benefit in the constituency for being a good scrutineer of legislation. \nPoliticians also lack expert support. MPs\u2019 staffing budgets are intended to fund four full-time assistants, with pay for the most senior capped at \u00a356,312 ($69,000). Many are young; turnover is high. In America\u2019s Congress, a representative can employ up to 18 full-time staff, often including legislative specialists. Members of the House of Lords have no paid personal researchers at all. \nThis weakening system of scrutiny has been hit by two great shocks. Brexit meant that the government needed to race against time to rewrite the statute book to get ready for separation from the EU. Covid-19 forced lawmakers to move even faster. \nFew dispute that speed was necessary. But the Brexit referendum introduced a shrill and aggressive politics that treated parliamentary scrutiny not as a service to voters, but as a betrayal of them. And there is growing concern, certainly among senior members of the House of Lords, that ways of legislating in times of crisis have become a new modus operandi. Civil servants, too, say that covid and Brexit have altered ministers\u2019 expectations about the time needed to properly draft a bill. A generation of MPs elected since 2015 knows little different. \n\u201cFor three years at least ministers seem to have regarded legislation as a series of party political broadcasts,\u201d says Lord Lisvane, formerly the most senior clerk in the House of Commons. A committee of cabinet ministers, chaired by the Leader of the Commons, is tasked with vetting draft laws before they enter the system. \u201cBut it seems a very soft touch these days. Ministers simply aren\u2019t put in the dock about their legislative aspirations,\u201d he says. \nIn recent years a growing number of bills have completed their main Commons stages (the second and third readings) in a single day, almost eliminating the chance for meaningful scrutiny. Some instances of haste were justifiable: to pass covid legislation or to change the royal household after the death of the queen. \nOthers were less excusable. The Energy Prices Act, dashed out by Liz Truss\u2019s government in 2022, underpinned a \u00a378bn programme of universal household and business subsidies. Analysts and MPs had proposed much cheaper targeted designs, but the Tory leadership contest that summer crowded out proper policy work. The act implementing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit trade agreement cleared the Commons and Lords in a single day on December 30th 2020; in contrast, ratification of the Maastricht treaty of 1992 was considered over a period of more than 400 days.\nAs a result of this haste, the details of laws are being worked out later in the process. In particular, ministers are asking for ever-broader powers today that will let them make policy tomorrow. Secondary legislation is law created by ministers through regulations known as \u201cstatutory instruments\u201d, and made under powers given to them by an act of Parliament. Conventionally, primary legislation is used to set policy (such as a new criminal offence) and secondary legislation to guide its implementation (such as setting the level of fines). But the boundaries are not precisely defined. The growing use of secondary legislation prompted the House of Lords in 2021 to warn that \u201cgovernment by diktat\u201d was leaching power from Parliament. \n\n\u201cSkeleton bills\u201d, which provide ministers with the framework powers to make a policy, but few clues as to what it will be in practice, were essential in the Brexit years as ministers prepared to take on old EU powers in areas such as fishing and chemicals. But their usage has become part of a pattern. The Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act, a law intended to keep trains and schools running during industrial disputes, was \u201calmost so skeletal that we wonder if bits of the bones were stolen away by wild animals and buried somewhere\u201d, declared Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Tory MP. \nSkeleton bills often depend on \u201cHenry VIII\u201d powers, named for the Tudor king\u2019s habit of governing by proclamation. These are clauses which state that ministers can amend past, or even future, acts of Parliament by issuing secondary legislation. Lord Judge, a former head of the judiciary, declared in a recent speech that they have become so common that \u201cwhen an act of Parliament omits a Henry VIII clause it is only because someone in the department has failed to press the relevant button on the computer.\u201d \nLord Blencathra, a former Tory minister, complains that since Brexit departmental lawyers have been \u201ctacking them on to tiddly little bills\u201d on the basis of \u201cjust in case\u201d. A bill now before Parliament, intended to prevent public bodies from engaging in boycotts of Britain\u2019s allies, contains five Henry VIII clauses. The Online Safety Act contains more than 20. Individually, these clauses may be justifiable; collectively, they point to a government seeking shortcuts in the legislative process. \nStatutory instruments get even less scrutiny than primary legislation. They are presented to Parliament and sifted by committees of lawmakers, but debates on them can last just minutes or seconds. They cannot be amended, but only voted down, which is rare. The last time the House of Commons blocked a statutory instrument was in 1979; the House of Lords last did so in 2015. The legal commitment to hit net zero by 2050, made in 2019, is likely to be the most expensive policy decision Britain will take this century. It was set by a statutory instrument after a 90-minute debate in the Commons and without a vote there, using a mechanism created in the Climate Change Act of 2008. \nUnder a procedure called \u201cmade affirmative\u201d, some statutory instruments become law as soon as a minister signs them; lawmakers vote on them later. The Economist\u2019s review of parliamentary data shows that this technique has been used far more liberally recently\u2014from 1.8% of the statutory instruments in 1997-2019 to 8.1% in 2019-22. Covid is mostly to blame.\nAll this haste is leading to less informed decisions. MPs often pass legislation with no idea as to its costs or benefits. Many impact assessments, which are meant to quantify the expected effects of proposed statutory instruments, \u201cappear to have been scrambled together at the last minute to justify a decision already taken\u201d, concluded a recent House of Lords report. The Home Office\u2019s impact assessment on the Illegal Migration Bill revealed that deporting a person to Rwanda would cost \u00a3169,000 and would only be cost-effective if many thousands of people were deterred. But it was not published until June 26th, two months after it had cleared the Commons. \nErrors are also rising. Some 11% of the statutory instruments laid in the 2022-23 session of Parliament were to correct previous drafting mistakes, more than double the 5% threshold that the House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee considers acceptable for human error. \u201cThe real problem is that this is such a convenient way of doing things,\u201d says Lord Thomas, a former Lord Chief Justice who sits on the committee. \u201cAnd when you do something because it\u2019s convenient, that is what really ought to cause you to worry.\u201d\n\nGood scrutiny has historically depended on the interplay between the House of Commons, which takes the lead on setting policy, and the unelected House of Lords, which has focused on revising and fine-tuning legislation. Many members of the upper house feel that they are doing the basic scrutiny that the Commons is shirking, and that the government pays their work less heed. Traditionally, the Lords has cajoled the government into making its own amendments to flawed bills. That process has broken down, leading the Lords to vote against the government more often. It has inflicted 370 defeats since December 2019, compared with 268 in 2010-19. \n\u201cWhen you see a larger number of defeats, a significant amount of it is down to greater government intransigence rather than greater Lords aggressiveness,\u201d says Professor Meg Russell of University College London. Sometimes they succeed in forcing a reversal. More often the amendments are thrown out when a bill returns to the Commons and have no impact. \nStrikingly few Conservative MPs are animated by how the rules of the parliamentary board game are being forgotten. But should an election force them into opposition, the costs of a weakened Parliament will be more obvious to them. Labour Party officials insist they will restore discipline to the process. But a Labour government would inherit a statute book packed with powers that could prove rather useful to ministers in a hurry. \nTake the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act, passed earlier this year, which creates wide-ranging powers for ministers to rewrite regulations that predated Brexit. Its neo-Thatcherite architects hoped it would ignite a deregulatory Big Bang. But it might as easily be used to strengthen trade-union rights or realign policies with those of the EU. \u201cThese powers could sit there for decades, being used by governments who may take an entirely different approach,\u201d says Dr Fox. \u201cThat does not seem to compute at all with ministers.\u201d The rules of the legislative game exist for the benefit of all the players. When they are bent, everyone ends up losing. \u25a0 \nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "description": "Hasty
