A PLA unit was in South Sudan in 2016 on UN peacekeeping duty, tasked with protecting two camps of civilians. When rebels and government forces clashed, the camps came under fire. As the Chinese troops took refuge, a rocket-propelled grenade hit one of their vehicles, killing two of them.\nBack home, China\u2019s government portrayed the tragedy as evidence that the country was emerging as a great world power, ready to shoulder weighty responsibilities. But to the PLA\u2019s commanders, the episode was a debacle that exposed one of their greatest vulnerabilities: an almost complete lack of combat experience.\nChina has not fought a war since the one with Vietnam in 1979 that lasted a month (though minor skirmishes continued for another decade). Back then the PLA was still using \u201chuman wave\u201d mass-infantry assaults of the sort that Mao Zedong had adopted during the Korean war. They proved ineffective against Soviet-armed Vietnamese forces hardened by fighting with America.\nThe PLA has suffered casualties since, but they have mostly been from illness, accident or suicide. A recent exception was the border clash with India in 2020 that killed at least four Chinese soldiers and 20 Indian ones. That was nothing like modern warfare, though. It was fought with fists, clubs and rocks.\nEven among the PLA\u2019s top generals, only a handful can actually claim to have seen action. \u201cI\u2019ve been a soldier for more than 50 years and I\u2019ve never been to war,\u201d Lieutenant-General He Lei, who once led a PLA regional command and was deputy head of the Academy of Military Science, tells The Economist. \u201cBut we can\u2019t go to war to increase our combat experience, right?\u201d\nSince taking power, Xi Jinping has tried to address this problem with the boldest overhaul of the PLA in more than 60 years. In addition to  toppling dozens of generals in a corruption probe, he has revamped training to focus on \u201creal combat\u201d and set the PLA new goals, including to be \u201cbasically\u201d modernised by 2035 and a \u201cworld class\u201d fighting force by 2049, the centenary of Communist rule.\nMr Xi, whose father was a renowned military commander, has been unsparing in his assessment of the PLA\u2019s weak points, spelling them out in two oft-repeated slogans. One, known as the \u201cTwo Inabilities\u201d, states that the PLA\u2019s ability to fight a modern war and its officers\u2019 ability to command are both lacking. Another, the \u201cFive Incapables\u201d, says that some commanders cannot judge situations, understand superiors\u2019 intent, make operational calls, deploy troops or deal with the unexpected.\nHe has accused the PLA of ailing from \u201cpeace disease\u201d. In 2018 the PLA Daily, the official military newspaper, warned that this was \u201cmore dangerous than rusting guns\u201d; it accused some officers and soldiers of being too negligent, proud, scared or incompetent to fight. \u201cSome are quite accomplished in antiques, calligraphy and painting, but neglect the study of combat methods and tactics.\u201d\nCentral to Mr Xi\u2019s plan has been a complete redo of PLA structures,  which had been designed primarily for land wars, following the old Soviet model. The new structures, unveiled in 2016, are meant to break down silos and to enable the PLA to conduct \u201cjoint\u201d operations, combining all services, as America\u2019s armed forces do. Those reforms were supposed to be finished by 2020.\nBut that deadline was optimistic. America undertook similar reforms with the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 to address an inter-services rivalry and insufficient civilian control exposed by the Vietnam war and the invasion of Grenada. That transition took longer than five years. And the PLA began from a far lower base. Its services and regional commands had been run like fiefdoms for years, a problem compounded by the lack of combat experience.\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr Xi\u2019s restructuring borrowed from similar reforms to the Russian armed forces. PLA commanders must now reckon with the poor performance of Russia\u2019s troops in Ukraine, as well as the surprising effectiveness of portable weapons systems, drones and other equipment used by Ukrainian forces.\nOne of the PLA\u2019s concerns is the fate of Russia\u2019s battalion tactical groups, or BTGs. They typically include 800 or so men, equipped with armour, artillery and air defences, and are designed to deploy at short notice, to move fast and to inflict casualties rather than hold territory. Formed ad hoc during Russia\u2019s wars in Chechnya in the 1990s and in Georgia in 2008, they were formalised from 2013 as part of Russia\u2019s \u201cNew Look\u201d military reforms.\nBattalion tactical goof\nWhen Mr Xi\u2019s overhaul began, China saw the BTG as a model to emulate. It was \u201ca self-sufficient unit that can perform tasks at any time\u201d, wrote Li Shuyin of the Academy of Military Science in 2017. That year the PLA dissolved many bigger units and introduced a new structure that featured hundreds of combined arms battalions, closely resembling BTGs, as its basic combat units.\nDuring wartime \u201cyou find out that your peacetime officers are not necessarily good combat leaders\u201dBy early 2023, however, the PLA had changed its tune. \u201cDeficiencies of Russia\u2019s battalion tactical groups have been exposed one after another, such as poor self-sufficiency in combat and inadequate logistical support,\u201d the PLA Daily said in January. \nThat is a particular worry for the PLA\u2019s amphibious battalions, which would spearhead an attack on Taiwan. They may be better equipped than Russia\u2019s BTGs. (They\u2019ve copied elements of American combat units too.) But the logistics of an amphibious assault will be more complex. And Chinese commanders have scant experience co-ordinating among services\u2014and only in peacetime.\nDuring wartime \u201cyou find out that your peacetime officers are not necessarily good combat leaders\u201d, says Dennis Wilder, a former CIA expert on China\u2019s armed forces. He notes that Chinese officers, unlike American counterparts, do not do routine joint-duty assignments outside their original services, so have limited understanding of how other parts of the PLA work.\nAmerica also makes more effective use than does China of non-commissioned officers (NCOs). The PLA has plenty of NCOs\u2014they outnumber the enlisted men and women below them\u2014but they are not as well-trained as in America and are not empowered to make decisions during engagements. And Chinese combat units still rely heavily on enlisted troops who serve only two years.\nThen there are the technological takeaways from Ukraine. One is an urgent need to figure out how to protect Chinese forces from the portable weapons systems such as Stinger and Javelin missiles that have wrought havoc on Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and even warships, wrote Huang Bin, a former Chinese defence-industry official, in October 2022. Taiwan has both types of missile and is getting more, along with HIMARS rocket launchers.\nAnother challenge is Starlink, the satellite network developed by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. It has been used by Ukraine to maintain contact with its own forces and to target Russian ones. Although it is unclear whether Mr Musk would allow Taiwan to use it in a war (his electric-vehicle business, Tesla, has its biggest factory in Shanghai), Chinese experts say the PLA must develop countermeasures\u2014and accelerate the production of its own equivalent.\nAnalysts in the PLA have also argued that China needs to learn from the public release of intelligence by Western governments and the proliferation of open-source intelligence. These have helped Ukrainian forces in combat and driven support for them abroad. \u201cThis highlights our shortcomings\u201d in international cognitive warfare, wrote two PLA researchers in January. Other PLA-linked scholars cite America\u2019s recent efforts to bolster alliances in Europe and Asia as a challenge for China, which has no explicit military allies and, despite defence ties with Pakistan, Russia and North Korea, cannot count on anyone else in a war over Taiwan.\nCompounding these problems is a lack of effective combat training. Exercises often used to be designed to impress superiors and achieve predetermined outcomes. Since Mr Xi demanded focus on \u201creal combat\u201d, exercises have become more realistic, pitting PLA troops against others simulating American or NATO tactics.\nBut a tendency to box-tick and avoid criticism endured after Mr Xi launched his military reforms, according to PLA publications. And doubts persist among Western analysts about how realistic the exercises are, especially in replicating electromagnetic interference by enemy forces. Tellingly, Mr Xi and senior PLA commanders continue to call regularly for more realistic training for joint operations and real combat.\nInexperience does not necessarily mean the PLA could not fight well. American, Japanese and Taiwanese analysts believe it has some highly proficient troops. And it has shown progress in drills around Taiwan, practising joint-combat operations, simulating a partial blockade and sending ships and planes across the median line of the Taiwan Strait almost daily. Still, some elements of those drills\u2014such as deploying an aircraft-carrier east of Taiwan where it could be easily hit by American forces\u2014seem designed for their political and psychological impact, not for military effectiveness.\nIncorporating the lessons of Ukraine into PLA doctrine will take time, not least because those lessons are still evolving. Adapting equipment and rotating troops through new exercises will take even longer. But the biggest challenge for the PLA may be the one that it began grappling with in 2016\u2014the transition to a truly joint force in which all services operate seamlessly together. \u25a0\nCorrection (8th November): Some photographs that were originally published online with this special report showed members of the People\u2019s Armed Police, not the People\u2019s Liberation Army.

not ready to fight", "section": "Special report", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/11/06/xi-jinping-worries-that-chinas-troops-are-not-ready-to-fight", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "The last time Chinese troops were caught in a major firefight, they learned a painful lesson. A PLA unit was in South Sudan in 2016 on UN peacekeeping duty, tasked with protecting two camps of civilians. When rebels and government forces clashed, the camps came under fire. As the Chinese troops took refuge, a rocket-propelled grenade hit one of their vehicles, killing two of them.\nBack home, China\u2019s government portrayed the tragedy as evidence that the country was emerging as a great world power, ready to shoulder weighty responsibilities. But to the PLA\u2019s commanders, the episode was a debacle that exposed one of their greatest vulnerabilities: an almost complete lack of combat experience.\nChina has not fought a war since the one with Vietnam in 1979 that lasted a month (though minor skirmishes continued for another decade). Back then the PLA was still using \u201chuman wave\u201d mass-infantry assaults of the sort that Mao Zedong had adopted during the Korean war. They proved ineffective against Soviet-armed Vietnamese forces hardened by fighting with America.\nThe PLA has suffered casualties since, but they have mostly been from illness, accident or suicide. A recent exception was the border clash with India in 2020 that killed at least four Chinese soldiers and 20 Indian ones. That was nothing like modern warfare, though. It was fought with fists, clubs and rocks.\nEven among the PLA\u2019s top generals, only a handful can actually claim to have seen action. \u201cI\u2019ve been a soldier for more than 50 years and I\u2019ve never been to war,\u201d Lieutenant-General He Lei, who once led a PLA regional command and was deputy head of the Academy of Military Science, tells The Economist. \u201cBut we can\u2019t go to war to increase our combat experience, right?\u201d\nSince taking power, Xi Jinping has tried to address this problem with the boldest overhaul of the PLA in more than 60 years. In addition to  toppling dozens of generals in a corruption probe, he has revamped training to focus on \u201creal combat\u201d and set the PLA new goals, including to be \u201cbasically\u201d modernised by 2035 and a \u201cworld class\u201d fighting force by 2049, the centenary of Communist rule.\nMr Xi, whose father was a renowned military commander, has been unsparing in his assessment of the PLA\u2019s weak points, spelling them out in two oft-repeated slogans. One, known as the \u201cTwo Inabilities\u201d, states that the PLA\u2019s ability to fight a modern war and its officers\u2019 ability to command are both lacking. Another, the \u201cFive Incapables\u201d, says that some commanders cannot judge situations, understand superiors\u2019 intent, make operational calls, deploy troops or deal with the unexpected.\nHe has accused the PLA of ailing from \u201cpeace disease\u201d. In 2018 the PLA Daily, the official military newspaper, warned that this was \u201cmore dangerous than rusting guns\u201d; it accused some officers and soldiers of being too negligent, proud, scared or incompetent to fight. \u201cSome are quite accomplished in antiques, calligraphy and painting, but neglect the study of combat methods and tactics.\u201d\nCentral to Mr Xi\u2019s plan has been a complete redo of PLA structures,  which had been designed primarily for land wars, following the old Soviet model. The new structures, unveiled in 2016, are meant to break down silos and to enable the PLA to conduct \u201cjoint\u201d operations, combining all services, as America\u2019s armed forces do. Those reforms were supposed to be finished by 2020.\nBut that deadline was optimistic. America undertook similar reforms with the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 to address an inter-services rivalry and insufficient civilian control exposed by the Vietnam war and the invasion of Grenada. That transition took longer than five years. And the PLA began from a far lower base. Its services and regional commands had been run like fiefdoms for years, a problem compounded by the lack of combat experience.\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr Xi\u2019s restructuring borrowed from similar reforms to the Russian armed forces. PLA commanders must now reckon with the poor performance of Russia\u2019s troops in Ukraine, as well as the surprising effectiveness of portable weapons systems, drones and other equipment used by Ukrainian forces.\nOne of the PLA\u2019s concerns is the fate of Russia\u2019s battalion tactical groups, or BTGs. They typically include 800 or so men, equipped with armour, artillery and air defences, and are designed to deploy at short notice, to move fast and to inflict casualties rather than hold territory. Formed ad hoc during Russia\u2019s wars in Chechnya in the 1990s and in Georgia in 2008, they were formalised from 2013 as part of Russia\u2019s \u201cNew Look\u201d military reforms.\nBattalion tactical goof\nWhen Mr Xi\u2019s overhaul began, China saw the BTG as a model to emulate. It was \u201ca self-sufficient unit that can perform tasks at any time\u201d, wrote Li Shuyin of the Academy of Military Science in 2017. That year the PLA dissolved many bigger units and introduced a new structure that featured hundreds of combined arms battalions, closely resembling BTGs, as its basic combat units.\nDuring wartime \u201cyou find out that your peacetime officers are not necessarily good combat leaders\u201dBy early 2023, however, the PLA had changed its tune. \u201cDeficiencies of Russia\u2019s battalion tactical groups have been exposed one after another, such as poor self-sufficiency in combat and inadequate logistical support,\u201d the PLA Daily said in January. \nThat is a particular worry for the PLA\u2019s amphibious battalions, which would spearhead an attack on Taiwan. They may be better equipped than Russia\u2019s BTGs. (They\u2019ve copied elements of American combat units too.) But the logistics of an amphibious assault will be more complex. And Chinese commanders have scant experience co-ordinating among services\u2014and only in peacetime.\nDuring wartime \u201cyou find out that your peacetime officers are not necessarily good combat leaders\u201d, says Dennis Wilder, a former CIA expert on China\u2019s armed forces. He notes that Chinese officers, unlike American counterparts, do not do routine joint-duty assignments outside their original services, so have limited understanding of how other parts of the PLA work.\nAmerica also makes more effective use than does China of non-commissioned officers (NCOs). The PLA has plenty of NCOs\u2014they outnumber the enlisted men and women below them\u2014but they are not as well-trained as in America and are not empowered to make decisions during engagements. And Chinese combat units still rely heavily on enlisted troops who serve only two years.\nThen there are the technological takeaways from Ukraine. One is an urgent need to figure out how to protect Chinese forces from the portable weapons systems such as Stinger and Javelin missiles that have wrought havoc on Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and even warships, wrote Huang Bin, a former Chinese defence-industry official, in October 2022. Taiwan has both types of missile and is getting more, along with HIMARS rocket launchers.\nAnother challenge is Starlink, the satellite network developed by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. It has been used by Ukraine to maintain contact with its own forces and to target Russian ones. Although it is unclear whether Mr Musk would allow Taiwan to use it in a war (his electric-vehicle business, Tesla, has its biggest factory in Shanghai), Chinese experts say the PLA must develop countermeasures\u2014and accelerate the production of its own equivalent.\nAnalysts in the PLA have also argued that China needs to learn from the public release of intelligence by Western governments and the proliferation of open-source intelligence. These have helped Ukrainian forces in combat and driven support for them abroad. \u201cThis highlights our shortcomings\u201d in international cognitive warfare, wrote two PLA researchers in January. Other PLA-linked scholars cite America\u2019s recent efforts to bolster alliances in Europe and Asia as a challenge for China, which has no explicit military allies and, despite defence ties with Pakistan, Russia and North Korea, cannot count on anyone else in a war over Taiwan.\nCompounding these problems is a lack of effective combat training. Exercises often used to be designed to impress superiors and achieve predetermined outcomes. Since Mr Xi demanded focus on \u201creal combat\u201d, exercises have become more realistic, pitting PLA troops against others simulating American or NATO tactics.\nBut a tendency to box-tick and avoid criticism endured after Mr Xi launched his military reforms, according to PLA publications. And doubts persist among Western analysts about how realistic the exercises are, especially in replicating electromagnetic interference by enemy forces. Tellingly, Mr Xi and senior PLA commanders continue to call regularly for more realistic training for joint operations and real combat.\nInexperience does not necessarily mean the PLA could not fight well. American, Japanese and Taiwanese analysts believe it has some highly proficient troops. And it has shown progress in drills around Taiwan, practising joint-combat operations, simulating a partial blockade and sending ships and planes across the median line of the Taiwan Strait almost daily. Still, some elements of those drills\u2014such as deploying an aircraft-carrier east of Taiwan where it could be easily hit by American forces\u2014seem designed for their political and psychological impact, not for military effectiveness.\nIncorporating the lessons of Ukraine into PLA doctrine will take time, not least because those lessons are still evolving. Adapting equipment and rotating troops through new exercises will take even longer. But the biggest challenge for the PLA may be the one that it began grappling with in 2016\u2014the transition to a truly joint force in which all services operate seamlessly together. \u25a0\nCorrection (8th November): Some photographs that were originally published online with this special report showed members of the People\u2019s Armed Police, not the People\u2019s Liberation Army.
