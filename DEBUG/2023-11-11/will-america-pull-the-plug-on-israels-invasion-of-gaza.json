Anger is mounting across the region. In Amman his Jordanian counterpart, Ayman Safadi, told Mr Blinken to \u201cstop this madness\u201d. The language he heard in private across the region was even tougher. His meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, lasted less than an hour and ended with no joint statement. Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey did not bother to meet him at all.\nIsraeli generals still talk about waging a long campaign that will last up to a year. On November 7th Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told abc News that Israel would be in charge of Gaza\u2019s security for an \u201cindefinite period\u201d. In practice, though, what Israeli officers call their \u201cwindow of legitimacy\u201d is probably far shorter. How fast that window closes will depend largely on America, which is supplying Israel with munitions, diplomatic support and an aid package worth perhaps $14bn. If Joe Biden wants the war to end, Israel will be hard-pressed to ignore him.\nSo far, he does not. Although he now supports \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d to allow more aid to enter Gaza, Mr Biden has rejected calls for an outright ceasefire. But administration officials have made clear, in a series of leaks, that they doubt Israel has a coherent exit strategy in Gaza. They complain that Mr Netanyahu is barely willing to discuss the topic, and say they want to put their concerns on the record now lest the war end badly.\nThey also have concerns about Israeli tactics. Asked about the IDF\u2019s efforts to minimise civilian deaths, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, practically tied himself in knots: \u201cWe have seen some indications that there are efforts being applied in certain scenarios to try to minimise [them],\u201d he said. To think a war risks becoming a devastating quagmire but to support it nonetheless is an untenable position\u2014especially when many American voters agree.\nAn Associated Press poll found that 58% of Democrats think Israel\u2019s response has gone too far and 44% think America is too supportive of it. A Quinnipiac survey of registered voters found that 51% of independents and 66% of people aged 18-34 disapprove of Mr Biden\u2019s policy. His ratings have plummeted among Arab-American voters, which could hurt him next year in crucial swing states like Michigan. Sources in Washington think it will still be several more weeks before Mr Biden pivots to talk of a truce\u2014but do not doubt that he will make such a shift.\nArab states certainly hope so. Fears of a multi-front war, which were acute in the days after Hamas\u2019s massacre, have eased. Hizbullah, a Lebanese Shia militia, is still firing rockets daily at Israel, but Hassan Nasrallah, the group\u2019s leader, signalled in a speech on November 3rd that he was not yet keen on all-out war. The Houthis, a Shia militant group in Yemen, have lobbed drones and missiles at Israel but are too far away to pose a strategic threat.\nMany regional autocrats would be happy to see Israel smash Hamas. But they are also nervous that the war will mobilise their subjects, many of whom are already restive about awful economic conditions. This adds to pressure on both America, which has heard their fears for weeks now, and Israel, which is keen to preserve its recent diplomatic gains in the Arab world.\nSo far, most countries have made do with symbolic rebukes of Israel. On November 2nd the lower house of Bahrain\u2019s parliament announced that the country would recall its ambassador from Israel. The chamber has few powers; recalling ambassadors is not one of them. Envoys from both countries had gone home weeks earlier. Parliament, in a fit of populism, made it seem as if lawmakers had decreed their return. Officials in both Bahrain and Israel say diplomatic ties remain intact.\nFour days later King Abdullah of Jordan announced that his air force had dropped a shipment of medical aid into Gaza. Jordan would not have taken such action without seeking Israel\u2019s approval, which the Israeli army later confirmed it had indeed given. By omitting that detail from his announcement, though, the king could act as if he had challenged Israel\u2019s blockade of Gaza. Such gestures do not earn much goodwill at home, however. \nEven the United Arab Emirates (uae), Israel\u2019s closest Arab ally, has grown increasingly critical (at least in public). Anwar Gargash, a foreign-policy adviser to the uae\u2019s president, said at a conference on November 4th that America should push for a ceasefire, \u201cthe quicker the better\u201d.\nThen there is Israel itself. Morale is high in the army and Israelis seem willing to accept far more casualties than normal (36 Israeli soldiers have been killed so far). But the public is furious with a prime minister more concerned with political survival than battlefield strategy. Protesters gathered at Mr Netanyahu\u2019s house on November 4th to demand his resignation.\nWatching and waiting\n\nAnother question is the economy. The month-long Lebanon war in 2006 cost around 9.5bn shekels ($2bn at the time, or 1.3% of GDP), whereas the last big Gaza conflict in 2014 cost 7bn shekels (0.6% of GDP). This one may be even costlier. The Bank of Israel thinks the government\u2019s deficit will climb to 3% of gdp next year, compared with a 0.6% surplus in 2022; some outsiders put the estimate above 5%. Mobilising 360,000 reservists has left parts of Israel\u2019s economy with a shortage of workers, even if some of them have now been sent home.\nIsraeli officials hope the next phase of the war will change these considerations. If the idf can destroy the facilities it has surrounded in Gaza city and kill large numbers of militants, it hopes Hamas\u2019s chain of command will be broken. Some leaders may escape, either through tunnels or disguised among evacuees, to southern Gaza. But Israel believes that having them on the run will weaken Hamas. That could allow a shift in strategy. \u201cWe can change tactics, have fewer forces inside Gaza, and attack Hamas strongholds in a series of smaller raids,\u201d says one general.\nThat in turn could ease international pressure, which spikes every time Israeli jets bomb a bakery or a refugee camp, and ease pressure on the economy by allowing the army to release some reservists. The Israelis also recognise that relieving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza could buy more time. On November 6th the UAE announced that it would set up a 150-bed field hospital in Gaza, a move co-ordinated with Israel. On November 8th Israel said 50,000 more people had fled north Gaza through a temporary civilian corridor. \nThe buck stops here\nArguably, though, the biggest challenge to Israel\u2019s international legitimacy is Mr Netanyahu himself. His government is stacked with radicals. Amichai Eliyahu, the heritage minister, recently suggested dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza. Zvi Sukkot, the new head of a parliamentary committee that oversees the occupied West Bank, is a far-right ideologue who has been investigated by Israel\u2019s Shin Bet for his alleged extremist activity.\nWhen they met in Ramallah, Mr Abbas told Mr Blinken that the Palestinian Authority, which controls parts of the West Bank, could return to Gaza to govern the enclave after the war. Such an outcome would please both the Israeli army and the Americans. But Mr Abbas added that it would happen only \u201cwithin the framework of a comprehensive political solution\u201d\u2014in other words, as a step towards a two-state solution, which Mr Netanyahu has spent his entire career fighting against.\nOn November 8th Mr Blinken offered a more pointed criticism of Israel\u2019s post-war plans. There could be no permanent reoccupation of Gaza, he said, nor any forced displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza. He also ruled out any reduction in its territory (some Israeli officials have proposed creating a larger \u201cbuffer zone\u201d around Gaza, on land carved out of the enclave). Mr Netanyahu has not ruled out any of these. If he stays in office, there will be no serious talk of an endgame. America\u2019s patience will run out and Israel will find its room for manoeuvre increasingly limited. \u25a0\nStay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our

dangerous new stage, nearly two weeks after it began. On November 5th the Israel Defence Forces (idf) unleashed a series of devastating air strikes in and around Gaza city. The goal was to damage Hamas\u2019s tunnel networks. Israeli troops are now operating in the city\u2019s centre, where they believe Hamas has its underground headquarters, having encircled it from three sides. The advance units on different axes are now so close to each other that one of their chief concerns is avoiding \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incidents.\nRead all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas\n\nIsrael\u2019s forces have penetrated far farther into Gaza than in the ground campaigns of 2009 and 2014. They believe they are getting closer to their stated goal of destroying Hamas, in particular its leadership, which Israeli intelligence believes to be holed up under the Shifa hospital (Israel claims it has evidence that Hamas is using other hospitals in the city as cover too; Hamas says this is a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d). Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defence minister, said on November 7th that Israeli forces had Yahya Sinwar, the current head of Hamas in Gaza, surrounded (he did not specify where). But to get to Hamas\u2019s headquarters, the idf must first get through the group\u2019s defensive lines.\nOn November 4th The Economist was invited by the idf to accompany troops to the front line. Over the course of several hours no civilians were seen. Officers and soldiers said they had sighted only a handful since entering Gaza city on October 27th. Around three-quarters of the 1m-strong civilian population is estimated to have heeded the idf\u2019s warnings and fled south, away from the part of the city which Israeli troops are now encircling. \nBut for the generals preparing the battle plans, the diplomatic clock is ticking. In horrific scenes over 10,000 Palestinians have already been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas. More than 11% of Gaza\u2019s buildings have been damaged or destroyed.\nThat explains why Antony Blinken, America\u2019s secretary of state, received a chilly reception as he shuttled across the Middle East in recent days. Anger is mounting across the region. In Amman his Jordanian counterpart, Ayman Safadi, told Mr Blinken to \u201cstop this madness\u201d. The language he heard in private across the region was even tougher. His meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, lasted less than an hour and ended with no joint statement. Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey did not bother to meet him at all.\nIsraeli generals still talk about waging a long campaign that will last up to a year. On November 7th Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told abc News that Israel would be in charge of Gaza\u2019s security for an \u201cindefinite period\u201d. In practice, though, what Israeli officers call their \u201cwindow of legitimacy\u201d is probably far shorter. How fast that window closes will depend largely on America, which is supplying Israel with munitions, diplomatic support and an aid package worth perhaps $14bn. If Joe Biden wants the war to end, Israel will be hard-pressed to ignore him.\nSo far, he does not. Although he now supports \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d to allow more aid to enter Gaza, Mr Biden has rejected calls for an outright ceasefire. But administration officials have made clear, in a series of leaks, that they doubt Israel has a coherent exit strategy in Gaza. They complain that Mr Netanyahu is barely willing to discuss the topic, and say they want to put their concerns on the record now lest the war end badly.\nThey also have concerns about Israeli tactics. Asked about the IDF\u2019s efforts to minimise civilian deaths, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, practically tied himself in knots: \u201cWe have seen some indications that there are efforts being applied in certain scenarios to try to minimise [them],\u201d he said. To think a war risks becoming a devastating quagmire but to support it nonetheless is an untenable position\u2014especially when many American voters agree.\nAn Associated Press poll found that 58% of Democrats think Israel\u2019s response has gone too far and 44% think America is too supportive of it. A Quinnipiac survey of registered voters found that 51% of independents and 66% of people aged 18-34 disapprove of Mr Biden\u2019s policy. His ratings have plummeted among Arab-American voters, which could hurt him next year in crucial swing states like Michigan. Sources in Washington think it will still be several more weeks before Mr Biden pivots to talk of a truce\u2014but do not doubt that he will make such a shift.\nArab states certainly hope so. Fears of a multi-front war, which were acute in the days after Hamas\u2019s massacre, have eased. Hizbullah, a Lebanese Shia militia, is still firing rockets daily at Israel, but Hassan Nasrallah, the group\u2019s leader, signalled in a speech on November 3rd that he was not yet keen on all-out war. The Houthis, a Shia militant group in Yemen, have lobbed drones and missiles at Israel but are too far away to pose a strategic threat.\nMany regional autocrats would be happy to see Israel smash Hamas. But they are also nervous that the war will mobilise their subjects, many of whom are already restive about awful economic conditions. This adds to pressure on both America, which has heard their fears for weeks now, and Israel, which is keen to preserve its recent diplomatic gains in the Arab world.\nSo far, most countries have made do with symbolic rebukes of Israel. On November 2nd the lower house of Bahrain\u2019s parliament announced that the country would recall its ambassador from Israel. The chamber has few powers; recalling ambassadors is not one of them. Envoys from both countries had gone home weeks earlier. Parliament, in a fit of populism, made it seem as if lawmakers had decreed their return. Officials in both Bahrain and Israel say diplomatic ties remain intact.\nFour days later King Abdullah of Jordan announced that his air force had dropped a shipment of medical aid into Gaza. Jordan would not have taken such action without seeking Israel\u2019s approval, which the Israeli army later confirmed it had indeed given. By omitting that detail from his announcement, though, the king could act as if he had challenged Israel\u2019s blockade of Gaza. Such gestures do not earn much goodwill at home, however. \nEven the United Arab Emirates (uae), Israel\u2019s closest Arab ally, has grown increasingly critical (at least in public). Anwar Gargash, a foreign-policy adviser to the uae\u2019s president, said at a conference on November 4th that America should push for a ceasefire, \u201cthe quicker the better\u201d.\nThen there is Israel itself. Morale is high in the army and Israelis seem willing to accept far more casualties than normal (36 Israeli soldiers have been killed so far). But the public is furious with a prime minister more concerned with political survival than battlefield strategy. Protesters gathered at Mr Netanyahu\u2019s house on November 4th to demand his resignation.\nWatching and waiting\n\nAnother question is the economy. The month-long Lebanon war in 2006 cost around 9.5bn shekels ($2bn at the time, or 1.3% of GDP), whereas the last big Gaza conflict in 2014 cost 7bn shekels (0.6% of GDP). This one may be even costlier. The Bank of Israel thinks the government\u2019s deficit will climb to 3% of gdp next year, compared with a 0.6% surplus in 2022; some outsiders put the estimate above 5%. Mobilising 360,000 reservists has left parts of Israel\u2019s economy with a shortage of workers, even if some of them have now been sent home.\nIsraeli officials hope the next phase of the war will change these considerations. If the idf can destroy the facilities it has surrounded in Gaza city and kill large numbers of militants, it hopes Hamas\u2019s chain of command will be broken. Some leaders may escape, either through tunnels or disguised among evacuees, to southern Gaza. But Israel believes that having them on the run will weaken Hamas. That could allow a shift in strategy. \u201cWe can change tactics, have fewer forces inside Gaza, and attack Hamas strongholds in a series of smaller raids,\u201d says one general.\nThat in turn could ease international pressure, which spikes every time Israeli jets bomb a bakery or a refugee camp, and ease pressure on the economy by allowing the army to release some reservists. The Israelis also recognise that relieving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza could buy more time. On November 6th the UAE announced that it would set up a 150-bed field hospital in Gaza, a move co-ordinated with Israel. On November 8th Israel said 50,000 more people had fled north Gaza through a temporary civilian corridor. \nThe buck stops here\nArguably, though, the biggest challenge to Israel\u2019s international legitimacy is Mr Netanyahu himself. His government is stacked with radicals. Amichai Eliyahu, the heritage minister, recently suggested dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza. Zvi Sukkot, the new head of a parliamentary committee that oversees the occupied West Bank, is a far-right ideologue who has been investigated by Israel\u2019s Shin Bet for his alleged extremist activity.\nWhen they met in Ramallah, Mr Abbas told Mr Blinken that the Palestinian Authority, which controls parts of the West Bank, could return to Gaza to govern the enclave after the war. Such an outcome would please both the Israeli army and the Americans. But Mr Abbas added that it would happen only \u201cwithin the framework of a comprehensive political solution\u201d\u2014in other words, as a step towards a two-state solution, which Mr Netanyahu has spent his entire career fighting against.\nOn November 8th Mr Blinken offered a more pointed criticism of Israel\u2019s post-war plans. There could be no permanent reoccupation of Gaza, he said, nor any forced displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza. He also ruled out any reduction in its territory (some Israeli officials have proposed creating a larger \u201cbuffer zone\u201d around Gaza, on land carved out of the enclave). Mr Netanyahu has not ruled out any of these. If he stays in office, there will be no serious talk of an endgame. America\u2019s patience will run out and Israel will find its room for manoeuvre increasingly limited. \u25a0\nStay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our
