"type": "Article", "articleBody": "SUMIT DAS, a 32-year-old shopkeeper in Kulajan, a town in Assam in India\u2019s north-east, divides his life into two parts: before the bridge and after. Until 2018 Kulajan, on the north bank of the Brahmaputra river, was poor and isolated. Crossing the river to reach the nearby commercial hub of Dibrugarh could take a day. Then Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, inaugurated the Bogibeel bridge, the country\u2019s longest rail-and-road crossing, cutting the journey time to less than an hour. Kulajan has been transformed. Mr Das used to be employed in a clothes shop and now runs his own. \u201cI owe this to the bridge,\u201d he says.\nThis is the sort of story Mr Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) likes to tell about north-east India. Long an embarrassment to the government in Delhi, the region\u2019s eight states are poor, insurgency-racked and mostly tucked away beyond neighbouring Bangladesh. No part of India\u2014not even restive Kashmir in the far north\u2014has been so little touched by its 76-year-long state-building effort. The Modi government has tried to change that.\n\nIt has accelerated infrastructure projects in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura (see map). It has improved relations with Bangladesh and tried to limit the ability of China\u2014which claims Arunachal\u2014to cause trouble. These efforts appeared to be succeeding\u2014until the eruption in May of ethnic conflict in Manipur. This has left more than 200 dead, 70,000 displaced and the state divided between two ethnic groups. Where, in light of that crisis, does Mr Modi\u2019s north-eastern approach stand?\nUnderstand, first, how daunting it is. The region\u2019s 50m people belong to dozens of ethnic groups, speak more than 200 languages and follow several religions. Many, including scores of militant bands, do not get along. The scar tissue of earlier interventions, British colonial and Indian, underlies their conflict. State borders imposed by the British jumbled tribal areas. The privileges some communities wrested from the central government\u2014a jobs quota here, a land settlement there\u2014enraged their neighbours. The conflict in Manipur was stirred by one such rivalry. The government in Delhi has sometimes intervened brutally. In 1966 India\u2019s then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered air strikes on the city of Aizawl, in what is now Mizoram, to quell a secessionist uprising. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many north-easterners feel little allegiance to India; other Indians tend to look on them suspiciously.\nRecent governments have tried to woo the region with peacemaking and development. Yet as India\u2019s growth rate has picked up, the disparity between the north-east and elsewhere has increased. The region\u2019s share of GDP fell from 3.1% in 1991 to 2.6% in 2011. Mr Modi, in power since 2014, has sought to tackle this. His government speeded up infrastructure projects, improved relations with some ethnic groups and ordered administrators to make the north-east more \u201cIndian\u201d. The pace of road construction more than doubled during the first five years of his tenure; the total length of national highways in the region is approaching 16,000km, up from 8,500 in 2014. It has 17 civilian airports, compared with nine a decade ago. The current union budget includes 59bn rupees ($700m) for development in the north-east, twice the previous year\u2019s allocation. The region\u2019s share of GDP was up to 2.8% in 2022. \nThis has brought major improvements. The Bogibeel bridge has also given Arunachalis access to Assam\u2019s stronger economy. \u201cFor the first time we are getting tourists from mainland India,\u201d says Komnga Karlo, a local leader in Arunachal. Meghalaya is trying to use better connections to boost ecotourism and fruit exports. \u201cThey\u2019ve done very well on infrastructure,\u201d says Subir Bhaumik, a journalist who has reported on the north-east since the early 1980s and is otherwise no fan of Mr Modi.\nBetter ties with Bangladesh, long a refuge for north-eastern militants, have also helped. On November 1st Mr Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, reopened a railway link between Tripura and Bangladesh, which had been dormant for seven decades, and a connecting line to Bangladesh\u2019s Mongla port. This will improve port access for both India and Nepal.\nSuch progress has helped the BJP make big political inroads in the region. The Hindu nationalists won power in Assam in 2016, ending 15 years of rule by the Congress party. They won in Manipur in 2017 and 2022, Tripura in 2018 and 2023, Arunachal Pradesh in 2019, and have joined governing coalitions in Meghalaya and Nagaland. Yet the flare-up in Manipur illustrates the limits of the BJP\u2019s approach.\nThe conflict pits the state\u2019s dominant Meitei community, which is mostly Hindu and accounts for 51% of Manipuris, against the poorer and mostly Christian Kuki minority, concentrated in the state\u2019s hilly periphery. It was sparked in May by plans to give Meiteis access to affirmative action and other measures reserved for Kukis. Yet the BJP, which invariably views communal relations through its Hindu-majoritarian lens, has hyped up the conflict\u2019s religious element, backing the Meiteis and casting the Kukis as criminals and insurgents. This has made a bad situation much worse. \nManipur\u2019s recent economic progress, for which the BJP had made great claims, has been undone. The picturesque green state has been torn between its Meitei-controlled valley and the Kuki-controlled hills, with armed police manning checkpoints in between. Nearly 5,000 houses and hundreds of temples and churches have been burned. With many fields and markets in effect inaccessible\u2014including to the many thousands huddled in over 300 refugee camps\u2014local agriculture is in crisis. The state\u2019s budding services economy is also at a standstill, the government having shut down the mobile internet, at least until November 13th. And the violence continues. On October 31st a police officer was shot dead near the border with Myanmar.\n\u201cThe Indian state has been very confident about the development of the region, but this kind of thing can undo it quickly,\u201d says Rakhee Bhattacharjee of the North East studies centre at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. Indeed, the crisis shows not only how fragile the region is, but how patchy are the BJP\u2019s strengths. Its economic plans are robust. But a party that rose by sowing discord between Hindus and Muslims makes a poor peacemaker.\nNot a peripheral issue\nThe bjp also has weak state-level leaders, a flipside of Mr Modi\u2019s charismatic leadership, exemplified by its hapless chief minister in Manipur, N. Biren Singh. This is by no means, as its opponents claim, a total indictment of the government\u2019s north-eastern strategy. It has already had striking success and promises more. But it is a reminder that India\u2019s progress under Mr Modi is liable to be fraught.\u25a0", "description": "Ethnic violence shows it will take more than infrastructure development",
