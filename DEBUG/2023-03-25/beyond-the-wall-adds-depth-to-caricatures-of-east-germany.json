The Berlin concrete wall was built by the East German government 13 August 1961 to seal off East Berlin from the part of the city occupied by the three main Western powers to prevent mass illegal immigration to the West. According to the \"August 13 Association\" which specialises in the history of the Berlin Wall, at least 938 people - 255 in Berlin alone - died, shot by East German border guards, attempting to flee to West Berlin or West Germany. The wall was opened 09 November 1989 and has been demolished since then.

By Katja Hoyer. Allen Lane; 496 pages; \u00a325. To be published in America by Basic Books in September; $35\nIn the eyes of its critics, the communist-run part of Germany was never a proper country. The Kremlin-backed puppet state belied its moniker, being neither German, nor Democratic, nor a Republic. To the day of its incorporation into West Germany in 1990, it was at most the \u201cGDR\u201d, written with inverted commas, or more contemptuously, the Zone\u2014recalling its original status as the Soviet-occupied bit of defeated Nazi Germany. \nFrom this dismissive premise, clich\u00e9 sprouts easily. The \u201cEast Germans\u201d were caricatured as clueless and robotic, ill-dressed and housed in dimly lit concrete hutches. They were thought to drive ridiculous little Trabant cars, with plastic bodywork and powered by lawnmower engines. The food was notoriously awful too. The few Westerners who experienced the GDR did so when driving across it to the fleshpots of West Berlin, or when they caught a budget flight to a far-flung destination (Cuba was a favourite) at the dismal Schonefeld airport. \nIn \u201cBeyond the Wall\u201d, Katja Hoyer adds depth, texture and colour to this simplistic picture. Her book\u2019s backbone is a vivid political history of the communist German state. The people who founded it were relics, survivors of the Stalinist purges that wiped out three-quarters of the exiled communists who had fled to the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Her sharply drawn pen-portraits bring to life Walter Ulbricht, the ghastly party overlord, and his cronies. Only their \u201cabdication of morality\u201d, she writes, enabled them to escape the purges. \nThis \u201cideological sediment\u201d of diehard loyalists determinedly recreated the Soviet system they revered. They faced a population traumatised by defeat (and the accompanying mass rapes by Soviet soldiers), along with an economy crippled by their occupiers\u2019 relentless demands for reparations. Harsh economic conditions prompted the workers\u2019 uprising of 1953. It was bloodily crushed by the Soviets, dispelling any pretence that the place was run on behalf of the toiling masses.\nRelations with the Kremlin were perennially mistrustful. The Soviet leadership would have readily sacrificed its comrades in Berlin if that meant securing a neutral, demilitarised Germany. Moscow also disliked warming ties between the two Germanys, though by the end West German bail-outs were keeping the easterners\u2019 economy afloat. \nAmid the great-power machinations, East Germans were real people, not cartoon characters from a cold-war comic book. They lived as best they could inside a political and economic system that mostly functioned badly and harshly. Their achievements\u2014cultural, sporting and industrial\u2014stoked genuine pride. Previously the author of an acclaimed history of the German empire, Ms Hoyer is now a British academic but was born in the GDR. \u201cThere was oppression and brutality,\u201d she writes, but also \u201copportunity and belonging\u201d.\nHer book is packed with vignettes and anecdotes that bring this half-forgotten side of German history to life. Your reviewer was a foreign correspondent covering the GDR in the late 1980s and married an East German. These stories ring true. \nThe book challenges Western smugness. Social mobility was far more common in East Germany than West Germany, Ms Hoyer relates. Working-class people went to university in much greater numbers. Child-care provision was superior. Unlike the situation in West Germany at the time, women could be army officers in the GDR. When their country was abolished, they were promptly sacked. \nThese are all fair points. West Germany itself was stiflingly conformist. Not only that, it was infested with Nazis in its early decades, plagued by political corruption and subject to hidden American tutelage. It came close to adopting police-state tactics against terrorism in the 1970s. \nFor all that, West Germany defies comparison to the brutal sham in the east. Cheap Soviet energy mitigated the gdr\u2019s economic failures. Snooping and bullying by the secret policemen of the Stasi cowed its people. So did the presence of some 350,000 Soviet troops. For most of its existence it murdered people caught escaping. \nThese features of life in the GDR were fundamental not incidental, whether in its heyday decade after the mid-1960s or its moribund decay in the 1980s. Ms Hoyer rightly highlights the gaps in modern Germany\u2019s understanding of the four decades of oppression in its eastern regions and the resentments that bequeathed. But sentimentality and relativism distort her evaluation of a loathsome dictatorship. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly
