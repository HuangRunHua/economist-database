The American giant was well ahead, to be sure. But its three-striped German rival had pep in its step. Under Kasper Rorsted, who took over as chief executive in October 2016, Adidas\u2019s revenues shot up\u2014by a cumulative 30% or so in the first three years of his stewardship. A lucrative deal from 2013 to make and sell trainers designed by Kanye West, an American rapper, was paying off handsomely; by 2021 Mr West\u2019s Yeezy line contributed 12% of Adidas\u2019s overall shoe sales. In August that year the company\u2019s market capitalisation reached \u20ac67bn ($79bn), more than twice what it had been five years earlier. \n\nToday Adidas looks like an also-ran. Revenues were more or less flat in the final three months of 2022, year on year. The company disclosed a quarterly operating loss of \u20ac724m. Far from catching up, it is falling further behind Nike, which on March 21st reported quarterly sales of $12bn, 14% higher than the year before and twice those of Adidas, and boasts cushy 13% operating margins worthy of its Air soles. Adidas\u2019s market value is back down to \u20ac25bn, one-seventh that of Nike. Investors today appear to have more confidence not just in the swoosh but in Puma, Adidas\u2019s smaller domestic rival (see chart).\nSome of Adidas\u2019s cramps are the result of factors beyond its control. Inflation pushed up supply-chain costs. The company had to wind down its sizeable business in Russia after the country\u2019s warmongering president, Vladimir Putin, sent tanks into Ukraine in February 2022, provoking an exodus of Western firms from the Russian market. And the increasingly erratic behaviour, including anti-Semitic outbursts, of Mr West (who now insists on being called Ye) led Adidas to cut ties with him in October last year. That left it with millions of unsold pairs of Yeezys, worth some \u20ac1.2bn. Unless these are somehow repurposed, the company expects to end 2023 with its first annual operating loss in 30 years, of perhaps \u20ac700m. The prospect of a recession in Europe and North America, and uncertainty over China\u2019s economic recovery, present another drag.\nBad luck is not the whole story, however. Mr Rorsted\u2019s focus on efficiency and cost, though in some ways welcome, came at a price. He treated Adidas\u2019s retail partners shoddily, preferring to focus on selling directly to consumers through the company\u2019s own shops. He also neglected investments in innovation. Mr Rorsted would have made a fine chief financial officer, says Florian Riedm\u00fcller of the Nuremberg Institute of Technology. Instead, he \u201cis an example of what happens when you put the wrong person into the top job\u201d.\nAdidas\u2019s board thinks it has now found the right one in Bjorn Gulden, who took over as CEO at the start of the year. The Norwegian former professional footballer had helped to turn round Puma, from which he was poached. \nMr Gulden\u2019s first task is to decide what to do with all the Yeezys (options include trying to sell them, possibly handing the proceeds to charity, donating them to a good cause, such as the victims of the recent earthquakes in Syria and Turkey, or just binning them). A bigger long-term challenge, says Aneesha Sherman of Bernstein, a broker, is what to do about China. Last year Adidas\u2019s Chinese sales fell by 36%. China\u2019s strict pandemic lockdowns and boycotts of Western brands that expressed concern about China\u2019s treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority both played a role; Nike\u2019s Chinese sales, too, declined in its latest quarter, by 8%. \nBut unlike Nike, China\u2019s bestselling sportswear brand, which has deftly adapted to local tastes, in particular a growing love of basketball, Adidas has been caught flat-footed. Its Chinese sales have been overtaken by those of Anta, a fast-charging local rival. Now it risks losing the number-three position to another, Li Ning. \nMr Gulden calls 2023 a \u201ctransition year\u201d that will smooth the path to rebuilding a profitable business in 2024. He plans to cut the dividend, reduce discounts on unsold kit, mend relations with retailers, and invest more in products and in the Adidas brand. That is a start. But if Adidas really wants to catch up with Nike, it will need to pick up the pace\u2014and then some. \u25a0 \nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom
