"description": "International animal protection organisation Animal Equality has launched a worldwide campaign and petition calling on the United Nations to immediately close wet markets across the globe. The so-called wet markets - which get their name in part from the blood, guts, scales and water that soak the stalls\u2019 floors as meat is freshly killed for customers - have been blamed for the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in China. They have now released these images, which were captured by Animal Equality at wet markets in China, Vietnam and India from 2013 onwards in a bid to show the conditions there. They say they show animals such as deer, raccoons, crocodiles, cats and dogs living in filthy conditions, suffering from dehydration, starvation and disease. Abigail Penny, Executive Director of Animal Equality UK said: \u201cWet markets are filthy, nightmarish places. The overwhelming fear that these poor animals suffer is unimaginable. Time and time again wet markets have been the source of dangerous viruses \u2013 they are a major threat to human health, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to close them temporarily, wet markets need to go once and for all. We simply cannot risk another disease outbreak. That\u2019s why we\u2019re urging the public to join our campaign today, calling on the United Nations to act now and ban wet markets globally.\u201d The group is calling on supporters to sign their petition in support of the ban here - animalequality.org.uk/act/ban-wet-markets Editorial use only Mandatory credit - Animal Equality UK / MEGA. 02 Apr 2020 Pictured: A wet market in Wuhan - shot in 2013.

A working paper they published online confirms, using genetic evidence, that animals such as dogs, weasels, foxes and hedgehogs were present at the seafood market in Wuhan whose customers and stallholders were among the first people in China to fall ill. In some ways that is unsurprising\u2014yet for a long time China\u2019s government denied that such wildlife markets even existed. It was not until 2021 that a paper by Chinese scientists reported they had seen animals for sale there.\nThe latest research draws on data collected in early 2020, when the Chinese Centres for Disease Control swabbed surfaces in the market after it was shut down. Notably, the research finds that the animals kept there included raccoon dogs\u2014which would have had the potential to transmit the virus to humans. The theory, then, is that animals transported to the market from outside the city might have triggered the pandemic. For China, this line of thought is probably preferable to an opposing theory that covid could have leaked from a nearby virology lab. Yet a market origin would hardly clear the Communist Party of blame.\nMarkets such as the one in Wuhan were greatly shrunk in the aftermath of a previous plague\u2014the deadly SARS outbreak of 2003 which was tied to wildlife trading of just this sort. Back then, scientists inside and outside China warned of the need to keep humans away from wild animals. \u201cOperation Green Sword\u201d seized 30,000 exotic animals from markets and restaurants in Guangdong, the southern province that had been at the centre of that disaster. A national campaign, \u201cOperation Spring Thunder\u201d, subsequently turned up some 900,000 more.\nYet individuals and companies who benefited from the wildlife trade resisted the curbs fiercely. Within months restrictions had been relaxed; business soon bounced back. By 2010 Zhong Nanshan, a doctor who became a hero during the SARS crisis, was warning a session of China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament that the wildlife trade\u2019s resurgence was increasing the risk of a new disaster. In 2017 annual revenue in China from exotic creatures reached 520bn yuan ($76bn), according to Peter Li at the University of Houston-Downtown in America. That money is made not only from selling animals for their meat but also for fur, for traditional medicine and to be put on display.\nSince 2020 the government has once again stepped up efforts to solve the problem. That year Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, said that eating wildlife \u201cwithout limits\u201d was a \u201cbad habit\u201d that had to be junked. China has imposed a fresh ban on consuming exotic animals. But Mr Li, noting that trading creatures for other reasons is still allowed, wonders how long even that prohibition will last. He says the wildlife industry retains powerful influence within the government.\nThe argument that a leaky laboratory may have been responsible for unleashing covid on the world has benefited traders of exotic animals. They see a chance to avoid blame for a pandemic that has killed millions. But evidence in favour of either of these theories leaves China\u2019s government with a lot to answer for. \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what
