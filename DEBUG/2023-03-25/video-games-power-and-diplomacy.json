In 2020 America\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the Treasury-chaired security committee that is looking into TikTok, reportedly wrote to Riot Games and Epic Games (respectively wholly and partly owned by Tencent) to ask how they handle personal data. In December Epic was fined $275m by American regulators for illegally collecting children\u2019s data. CFIUS is not yet alarmed, Mr Lewis believes. But as gaming technology is adapted to purposes beyond mere play, security concerns become more sensitive. Game engines, 3D-modelling tools for developing games, are used for everything from airport management to war-gaming simulations for the armed forces.\nA second worry is over broader Chinese influence. Western studios may change games in China to tone down sex or violence, or replace skeletons with zombies to skirt laws against \u201csuperstition\u201d. But the reach of Chinese censors extends far beyond China. The chat function in \u201cGenshin Impact\u201d, for instance, blots out such sensitive words as \u201cTaiwan\u201d and \u201cFalun Gong\u201d (alongside \u201cHitler\u201d and \u201cPutin\u201d). And some Western developers bend the knee to the Chinese government. In 2019 Ng Wai-chung, a Hong Kong-based e-sports player, used a post-match interview to declare: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time!\u201d The American game company that ran the league, Activision Blizzard, which counts Tencent as an investor, cancelled his $10,000 prize money and suspended him from competing. A message on the game\u2019s Chinese social media account--run by a Chinese business partner, Blizzard says--promised to \u201cresolutely safeguard [China\u2019s] national dignity\u201d. (After an outcry in America the firm partly backtracked.) Riot Games, which is wholly owned by Tencent, later announced that it would ban political speech from its \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d tournaments.\nGame studios are \u201cincreasingly savvy and increasingly paranoid\u201d in their dealings with China, says James Tager of PEN International, a free-speech pressure group. Like old-media companies worried that an offensive film might jeopardise not just a single title but their other interests in China, game developers that are part of big companies are likely to practise self-censorship to preserve market access, he says.\nSo far the trade-offs have attracted less controversy at home than the equivalent moves by Hollywood studios, which have been accused by American politicians of \u201ckowtowing\u201d to China. As Mr Tager puts it, one reason may be that \u201cthe average representative in Congress is not playing video games, but they are watching movies.\u201d As gaming\u2019s popularity grows, Chinese-made games find their way into more living rooms and more gamers enter Congress, Western politicians\u2019 complaints may grow louder.\u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Super Mario diplomacy", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Special report"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/ak20usde603e242i79e6aq83sbjgoos9", "tegID": "ak20usde603e242i79e6aq83sbjgoos9", "headline": "Special report", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023-04-22", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/vc7aqd9104ud89toio3j17g63ic4vrp3", "type": ["PublicationIssue", "Report", "SpecialReport"], "headline": "A difficult new world", "subheadline": "The car industry", "datePublished": "2023-04-22T00:00:00Z", "description": "Everything about carmaking is changing at once.

As snow falls, a guard stands watch, making sure no pilgrims get too close. The site is surrounded by a wall, but over it a grey building is visible, marked with eight characters that spell out its name: Nintendo. Japan\u2019s gaming industry has a following bordering on the religious. In Tokyo foreigners flock to Akihabara, the \u201celectric town\u201d of game arcades, or roar around by go-kart in homage to \u201cMario Kart\u201d. Osaka has a Super Nintendo World theme park. When Japan shows off to the world, it reaches for games as often as for samurai or sushi. Collecting the Olympic torch in Rio in 2016, its then prime minister, Abe Shinzo, emerged in the stadium from a green drainpipe, dressed as Mario.\nPopular culture\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d has been evident ever since Hollywood began. In 1950 Walter Wanger, an American producer, said film exports were more important \u201cthan the H bomb\u201d. Every movie reel exported was an American ambassador, he said, dubbing this \u201cDonald Duck diplomacy\u201d. A new soft power is now on the rise: Super Mario diplomacy. As games take up a bigger share of people\u2019s time, they become a weapon in the battle of ideas. And unlike movies, in which America remains the world\u2019s only superpower, the contest in gaming is wide open.\nJapan conquered Western living rooms in the 1980s when Atari, an American game pioneer, collapsed and Nintendo saw an opening. Japan\u2019s anime cartoons had a niche following, but gaming was the cultural export \u201cthat would really monetise and become an influential cultural phenomenon,\u201d says Nakamura Akinori of Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. The university\u2019s Centre for Game Studies, stacked with 10,000 video games and 150 pieces of hardware, shows how Japan led the gaming market by the 1990s, with Nintendo, Sega and later Sony dominant. More American children recognised Mario than Mickey Mouse. Unlike Japanese consumer-electronic successes, notes Matt Alt, author of \u201cPure Invention\u201d, a book on Japanese culture, games represented not just efficient manufacturing but \u201ca triumph of ideas\u201d.\nSome ideas are stylistic: the two-dimensional artwork in games such as the \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d series follows a Japanese tradition which Hirabayashi Hisakazu, a writer on gaming, traces to the artwork of the Heian period. Others concern gameplay mechanics. The \u201cloot box\u201d, a now-ubiquitous monetisation feature allowing players to buy a package of random power-ups, is derived from the Japanese market for gacha, vending machines that sell surprise toys. Japanese games have a greater emphasis than Western ones on co-operative play, and less on firearms, says Mr Hirabayashi, who talks of a culture of \u201cthe katana, not the gun\u201d.\nBut Japan\u2019s grip is now weaker. Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gave America a share of the console market. Western developers found it easier to write games for the Xbox\u2019s Windows-based system. Sony and Nintendo still have a lead in consoles. But gaming has shifted to mobile, and the two main operating systems, Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iOS, are American-owned. The production of games is also more varied. Whereas the global movie business is still dominated by America (which produced 17 of last year\u2019s 20 highest-grossing films, with China making the other three), the games business is international: last year\u2019s 20 highest-grossing mobile games came from nine different countries.\n\nJapan is also held back by a large domestic market with a culture that others can find baffling. In \u201cUma Musume\u201d (\u201cHorse Girl\u201d), the world\u2019s ninth-highest-earning mobile game of 2022, the player trains young women to compete in races. The game made $800m in Japan last year, but has yet to be released elsewhere. South Korea has become the emerging new power, encouraged by a government that declared games part of the Hallyu, or Korean cultural wave, that includes K-pop music and such movies as the Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d. Many of its games mimic Japanese style, but that is changing. Krafton, a big Korean developer, is working on a game adaptation of \u201cThe Bird That Drinks Tears\u201d, a series of novels based on Korean mythology.\nIf any country is now winning the race, it is China, which produced six of last year\u2019s top 20 mobile games, including two of the top three: Tencent\u2019s \u201cHonor of Kings\u201d and miHoYo\u2019s \u201cGenshin Impact\u201d. China\u2019s success contrasts with failed efforts in old media. Chinese movies compete with Hollywood in quality, but they are geared firmly to the home audience (\u201cWater Gate Bridge\u201d, last year\u2019s biggest hit, is mainly about killing Americans). Yet though Chinese film-makers can focus on a domestic market, Chinese game developers cannot. China\u2019s government has dubbed games \u201cspiritual opium\u201d and slapped restrictions on them, limiting children\u2019s gaming time to three hours a week and rationing new releases. Developers have had to look to international markets instead. \u201cHonor of Kings\u201d has a medieval European look. \u201cGenshin Impact\u201d looks so like \u201cZelda: Breath of the Wild\u201d that Nintendo fans publicly smashed up rival consoles in protest. Chinese developers have earned a reputation as \u201ccopycats\u201d, says Suh Bo-kyung of Bernstein, a broker. But their games are worldwide hits.\nThis Chinese success has sparked concerns, and not only among developers in other countries who feel ripped off. One worry is security. As with TikTok, a Chinese-owned social-media app that has spread like wildfire in the West, Chinese games are seen as tools gathering data for China\u2019s government. Games often seek personal information\u2014name, date of birth, payment details\u2014or record voice clips. The move to online play makes for better spying tools, since \u201cpeople\u2019s boxes will be connected directly to China\u201d, says James Lewis of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington, DC. Some players accused \u201cGenshin Impact\u201d of installing spyware on their PC after finding its anti-piracy software running even after the game was removed (the developer said this was a mistake and issued a fix).\nChinese whispers\nEven American firms with Chinese investment are under scrutiny. In 2020 America\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the Treasury-chaired security committee that is looking into TikTok, reportedly wrote to Riot Games and Epic Games (respectively wholly and partly owned by Tencent) to ask how they handle personal data. In December Epic was fined $275m by American regulators for illegally collecting children\u2019s data. CFIUS is not yet alarmed, Mr Lewis believes. But as gaming technology is adapted to purposes beyond mere play, security concerns become more sensitive. Game engines, 3D-modelling tools for developing games, are used for everything from airport management to war-gaming simulations for the armed forces.\nA second worry is over broader Chinese influence. Western studios may change games in China to tone down sex or violence, or replace skeletons with zombies to skirt laws against \u201csuperstition\u201d. But the reach of Chinese censors extends far beyond China. The chat function in \u201cGenshin Impact\u201d, for instance, blots out such sensitive words as \u201cTaiwan\u201d and \u201cFalun Gong\u201d (alongside \u201cHitler\u201d and \u201cPutin\u201d). And some Western developers bend the knee to the Chinese government. In 2019 Ng Wai-chung, a Hong Kong-based e-sports player, used a post-match interview to declare: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time!\u201d The American game company that ran the league, Activision Blizzard, which counts Tencent as an investor, cancelled his $10,000 prize money and suspended him from competing. A message on the game\u2019s Chinese social media account--run by a Chinese business partner, Blizzard says--promised to \u201cresolutely safeguard [China\u2019s] national dignity\u201d. (After an outcry in America the firm partly backtracked.) Riot Games, which is wholly owned by Tencent, later announced that it would ban political speech from its \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d tournaments.\nGame studios are \u201cincreasingly savvy and increasingly paranoid\u201d in their dealings with China, says James Tager of PEN International, a free-speech pressure group. Like old-media companies worried that an offensive film might jeopardise not just a single title but their other interests in China, game developers that are part of big companies are likely to practise self-censorship to preserve market access, he says.\nSo far the trade-offs have attracted less controversy at home than the equivalent moves by Hollywood studios, which have been accused by American politicians of \u201ckowtowing\u201d to China. As Mr Tager puts it, one reason may be that \u201cthe average representative in Congress is not playing video games, but they are watching movies.\u201d As gaming\u2019s popularity grows, Chinese-made games find their way into more living rooms and more gamers enter Congress, Western politicians\u2019 complaints may grow louder.\u25a0", "description": "Gaming is a growing source of soft power,
