Next they went to a grimy city, where they escaped a snarling, fiery monster. Then they flew to a stadium to see a show, during which they floated around the arena.\nA game? A gig? A social event? The makers of this live production, staged on January 27th by The Kid Laroi, an Australian rapper, opted for \u201cimmersive sonic experience\u201d. It took place in \u201cFortnite\u201d, an online multiplayer game that is often a venue for mass virtual gatherings. It was the latest case of games being the platform of choice for digital activities that go beyond conventional play.\nThere was a burst of excitement about such experiences in 2021, when they were dubbed part of the \u201cmetaverse\u201d, a term coined in \u201cSnow Crash\u201d, a 1992 novel by Neal Stephenson. This virtual space would form \u201ca new economy that is larger than our current economy\u201d, promised Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a chipmaker. Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook\u2019s name to Meta and called it a \u201cmetaverse company\u201d. The buzzword featured over 500 times on company earning calls in the final quarter of 2021, says a tally by GlobalData, a research firm. But the metaverse has fallen out of fashion. It became linked to the boosterism for cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens before their crash in 2022. Investors\u2019 excitement turned to impatience, not least at Meta, whose share price plunged by 65% last year. Last month Mr Zuckerberg announced cuts and a \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d.\nOne reason for disillusionment with these virtual worlds is the slow pace of improvement of virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), technologies that bring such environments to life. About a quarter of American adults under 40 own a VR headset, largely thanks to Meta, which sold truckloads of its Quest 2 goggles to a bored, locked-down audience. But headsets are more of a novelty than the ubiquitous platform Mr Zuckerberg predicted. Apple\u2019s first headset, due later this year, may cost several thousand dollars. \u201cThere\u2019s a very high entry-barrier for users, particularly in emerging countries,\u201d says Kim Chang-han, chief executive of Krafton, whose free games are played mostly on mobile phones.\nThe delayed arrival of good, cheap VR and AR technology means most immersive online experiences are still on ordinary screens, where games are the leaders. \u201cI didn\u2019t see video games coming when I wrote \u2018Snow Crash\u2019. I thought that the killer app for computer graphics would be something more akin to TV,\u201d Mr Stephenson wrote. \u201cThanks to games, billions of people are now comfortable navigating 3D environments on flat 2D screens.\u201d\nGames like \u201cFortnite\u201d have created the cheapest and most realistic 3D environments. This became clear in the pandemic, when real-world gatherings hastily went online. After South by Southwest, a festival in Austin, Texas, was cancelled in 2020, revellers decamped to \u201cMinecraft\u201d for a virtual festival called Block by Blockwest. Bored by Zoom, some people staged work meetings in games. \u201cRed Dead Redemption 2\u201d, a cowboy adventure, facilitated cosy team chats around the campfire (as well as shoot-outs).\nLockdowns may have lifted, but the use of gaming environments for other purposes has continued. Roblox has staged concerts and fashion shows, as well as educational events for organisations like the Museum of Science in Boston, which organised a virtual mission to Mars. FIRST, an educational outfit which organises robot-building contests for children, runs them on Roblox too. Epic Games, which makes \u201cFortnite\u201d, is working with the lego Group to build what it calls a metaverse for children.\nAs games evolve, they swallow up experiences that once belonged to other media. Last year \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d, a long-running TV drama, staged an interactive experience on Facebook Gaming. Users participated in daily activities to determine how the story would unfold. GenVid Technologies, which created the hybrid game-cum-show, will launch a similar experience based on \u201cSilent Hill\u201d, a long-running video game. Netflix has used streaming to create interactive TV shows where viewers can choose how the plot develops. And where once people watched fitness videos, increasingly they play fitness games. In February, after a battle with regulators, Meta acquired Within, which makes VR workout experiences. In the same month Tencent invested in Quell, a British maker of fitness games.\nMany believe that AR, which maps video graphics onto the user\u2019s vision of the real world, will be the next big tech platform. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s boss, has called it \u201cprofound\u201d. Yet today the most successful AR app is \u201cPok\u00e9mon GO\u201d, a monster-hunting game in which players use mobile phones to track down animated creatures. Technology honed in \u201cPok\u00e9mon GO\u201d has allowed Niantic, its American developer, to devise a system for mapping the world in AR, something that will have widespread uses if AR glasses become mainstream.\nAs interactions are more electronically mediated, gaming touches all corners of lifeGaming\u2019s lead in these new platforms is down to technology overlaps. But another explanation is behavioural. \u201cGames, even before video games, were a way for people to meet one another and spend time together socially,\u201d says John Hanke, Niantic\u2019s chief executive. \u201cSo when you talk about getting people together through some electronic mediation, games are already a natural fit.\u201d As interactions are more electronically mediated, gaming touches all corners of life. \u201cPerhaps one day, we won\u2019t even have the term \u2018gamer\u2019,\u201d says Jim Ryan, chief executive of Sony\u2019s gaming division, \u201cbecause everyone will play in some form or other.\u201d\u25a0", "description": "Video games are becoming platforms for more than play", "ogDescription": "Video games are becoming platforms for more than play", "imageUrl":
