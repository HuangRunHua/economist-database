The pace of life was steady, to put it mildly. \u201cMost of them regarded all forms of change with the gravest suspicion,\u201d wrote that former administrator, Peter Lloyd. \u201cThe town itself reflected their attitude, being the epitome of changelessness. As just one example, my palatial residence had been completed in 1892, yet everybody still called it \u2018the new house\u2019.\u201d\nAnd what a house! Despite the absence of both electricity and piped water and the presence of a multitude of bats, it was a place of delights. So vast that I occupied only a small part of the building\u2026Whole families were established elsewhere in it, claiming to be descendants of slaves of its original owner, with squatters\u2019 rights. In return they performed odd jobs, like bringing up water from the cistern. I even discovered, after living there for several months, that someone had started a shop in the back premises.\nAfter Kenya won its independence in 1963, the house fell into disrepair. But in 1970 Jim Allen, an Anglo-Kenyan scholar with an engagingly grumpy air and an almost obsessive love of Lamu, persuaded the government to convert it into the Lamu Museum. Allen became the founding director, filling the dusty and dilapidated rooms with an array of paraphernalia from up and down the coast. \nFollowing Allen\u2019s departure in 1974 and death 16 years later, the museum\u2019s fortunes ebbed and flowed, lacking funds and dynamic leadership. The building at last looked truly old. The antique cannon by the front door still pointed out across the channel, where dhows with traditional triangular sails go gently by. But few people, locals or tourists, bothered to pass through the handsomely carved wooden portal.\n\nIn the past few years, however, it has undergone a revival, thanks to funds from the sultanate of Oman, whose still-reigning al-Busaidi dynasty once ruled much of the east African coast. Last month the museum was reopened with much fanfare by Kenya\u2019s minister of tourism, wildlife, culture and heritage. The renovation shows how, nowadays, history is sometimes told not by the winners, but by the funders.\nThe museum is now spick and span. There is no sign of bats or any other random detritus from the days of Lloyd or even those of Allen, though heavily laden donkeys still trot past (cars remain banned on the island). But the locals are taken aback. For the emphasis of the heritage narrated inside, captioned in Swahili, English and Arabic, is almost entirely Omani. There are models of a newly constructed town and recently restored buildings\u2014all of them in Oman. Whole rooms and galleries, replete with videos, are dedicated not to Lamu but to Oman.\nThe old museum\u2019s fanciest and most valuable artefact, a side-blown horn known as a siwa\u2014carved with intricate beauty out of an immense elephant tusk\u2014has been dispatched to Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s distant capital, reportedly for security reasons. An elderly museum guide, disconsolately showing your correspondent around, muttered, \u201cOman! Oman! Oman! Why no Lamu?\u201d Mohammed Mwenje, the museum\u2019s director, says his team are still working on the part of the exhibition that will be devoted to the island. Most of the relevant items, he maintains, \u201chave not yet returned from storage\u201d.\nThe entrance hall, meanwhile, is graced with two grand portraits, side by side, of the recently elected president of Kenya, who hails from 700km (435 miles) away, and the sultan of Oman. Allen, the museum\u2019s founder, widely credited with putting Lamu on the cultural map when it was a hidden backwater, is unmentioned. \nMore controversially, so is the topic of slavery, which the Omani elite practised well into the 20th century. From around 1700 until the British arrived in the late 19th century, the sultanate of Oman ruled a coastal strip that stretched down to include Zanzibar (which is now part of Tanzania). Zanzibar became an entrepot for dates, cloves, carpets, mangrove poles and\u2014not least\u2014slaves. At one time slaves were reckoned to make up at least half of its population.\nIn 1907 Zanzibar\u2019s sultan, a scion of the Omani al-Busaidi dynasty, was forced by his British overlords to outlaw the practice up and down the coast. Nevertheless, \u201cperhaps half of [Lamu\u2019s] slave population, including whole families, remained under a system of de facto, if not de jure, slavery,\u201d according to the American Historical Review (AHR) in 1983. In his nostalgic essay, Lloyd relates how in the 1950s some visiting Omani luminaries made a suggestion. The British were then detaining many hundreds of rebellious Mau Mau fighters, mostly ethnic Kikuyus from far inland, in prison camps along the coast. Why not, said those bigwigs, send them off to Oman\u2014as slaves?\n \u201cIn form and under Islamic law,\u201d recounts the AHR, \u201cthe institution of slavery continued in some measure, and among some families, until Kenya achieved independence.\u201d The result was one of Africa\u2019s bloodiest revolutions, when the Omani family\u2019s Zanzibari branch\u2014which still reigns in Oman today\u2014was finally overthrown in 1964. Even after that, says the ahr, de facto slavery endured on Lamu into the 1980s, \u201cby collusion among the old Afro-Arab families (including relatives of the sultan)\u201d. It may have lasted even longer. \nThe old house has been beautifully restored, yet its antiseptic makeover has scraped away some of its mystery and romance. The sanitisation of the past has dulled its impact. The underlying lesson is that, if you bankroll a museum and its telling of history, you can stamp your own memory on them. Not all the people of Lamu are pleased. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter", "description":
