On February 10th a starving man in his 70s took a stand outside the communist party office in Hyesan, a city in the northern part of North Korea. As party members arrived for work, he called out, \u201cI\u2019ll die of starvation if things continue like this, please give me food.\u201d Other famished people quickly joined him. When security guards tried to dispel the crowd, a skirmish ensued. In a country where causing a disturbance can get you sent to the gulag, or worse, dissent of this kind appears to be vanishingly rare.\nSuch incidents, reported by Rimjin-gang, a secret group of journalists operating inside North Korea, offer a glimpse of the closed-off state\u2019s growing food crisis. The UN reckons that between 2019 and 2021, 42% of North Koreans were malnourished. And as a result of poor weather conditions and a shortage of fertiliser\u2014in part due to the country\u2019s self-imposed three-year quarantine\u2014it had an especially poor harvest last year. Total food production was only 4.5m tonnes, down by 3.8% compared with the year before, according to South Korea\u2019s rural development agency. That is more than 1.2m tonnes less than the UN\u2019s World Food Programme estimated in 2019 was needed to feed the country. \nIts statist agricultural system has long failed to produce enough food for North Korea\u2019s 26m people. A famine in the 1990s cost at least 200,000 lives\u2014and by some estimates as many as 3m. The current hunger is less serious. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re certainly not there yet,\u201d says Lucas Rengifo-Keller of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank in Washington. But, he adds, \u201cit won\u2019t take much to reach that level.\u201d South Korea\u2019s government is sounding the alarm. It believes some North Koreans are already starving. Horrifying reports, including one of a seven-year-old found starved to death with two family members, are seeping across the border.\nTrade is the likeliest source of relief, says Choi Eun-ju of the Sejong Institute, a think-tank near Seoul. But though official cross-border trade has been increasing, it is well below pre-covid-19 levels; Chinese trade data suggest that in 2022 North Korea imported more than 56,000 tonnes of flour and 53 tonnes of cereals. In the past, moreover, much of North Korea\u2019s food was imported off-the-books. And a decision by the regime of Kim Jong Un to close its borders in January 2020, ostensibly as a pandemic defence, has limited such food imports, as well as those of fertiliser. Newly built border fences guarded by soldiers with shoot-to-kill orders have apparently reduced food smuggling to close to zero. \nThe prices of rice and maize, which make up 98% of the country\u2019s cereal production, hint at the seriousness of the situation. Both are at five-year highs for March, according to DailyNK, a Seoul-based outlet with contacts inside North Korea. The cost of maize is rising fastest, suggesting that North Koreans are being forced to opt for that less calorific crop. DailyNK reports that ordinary people have also been called on to contribute \u201cpatriotic rice\u201d to the country\u2019s armed forces.\nThe situation may be about to deteriorate further; the lean season before the first rice and maize harvest, known as the \u201cbarley hump\u201d, is imminent. And the weather promises no relief. Winter snow, which provides meltwater for irrigation, has been below average. North Korean media, which are admittedly less than reliable, warn of a possible drought. \nThe regime of Kim Jong Un is sufficiently worried to have acknowledged the crisis on several occasions. At a communist party meeting earlier this month, Mr Kim called on his cadres to usher in a \u201cnew era\u201d of rural development. This intervention is additionally worrying. The famine of the 1990s was ultimately ended by small-scale private farming and trade, which sprang up amid the ruins of the country\u2019s Stalinist agriculture and distribution systems, notes Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein of the Stimson Centre, a think-tank in Washington. He and other North Korea-watchers believe these markets should be sufficient to prevent another severe famine. Yet the Kim regime appears to be intent on tightening its grip on them.\nRimjin-gang reports that the state has banned the sale of food in markets in some cities to give state-run food shops, which are selling grain at below-market prices, a monopoly. Other elements of Mr Kim\u2019s \u201cnew era\u201d, such as new irrigation systems and farming equipment, are longstanding but unfulfilled regime promises. North Koreans who spoke to DailyNK said they wished the government would focus on distributing food and fertiliser. \u201cPeople on the verge of starvation aren\u2019t likely to do a great job\u201d of farming, said one.\nWFP has tripled its budget for North Korea for the first half of 2023. But the UN agency\u2019s staff are barred from entering the country and there is currently no sign that that will change. In February North Korea\u2019s regime newspaper derided foreign aid as \u201cpoison candy\u201d and an insult to the country\u2019s \u201chonour and dignity\u201d. \nSouth Korea has also offered aid, with the proviso that the North must resume negotiating a possible end to its nuclear-weapons programme. But Mr Kim sees nuclear arms as the guarantor of his regime\u2019s continued existence. In March alone North Korea has launched five missiles, including an intercontinental ballistic missile and what state media claimed was the country\u2019s first submarine-launched cruise missile. For the Kim regime, guns will always beat butter.\u25a0", "description": "Reports of terrible hunger are emerging from the closed-off state", "ogDescription": "Reports of terrible hunger are emerging
