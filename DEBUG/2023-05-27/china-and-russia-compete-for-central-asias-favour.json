"articleBody": "Central Asia\u2019s top brass is on tour. On May 9th presidents of the region\u2019s former Soviet republics were in Moscow, having been roped in as spectators for Vladimir Putin\u2019s annual military parade. Ten days later, as g7 leaders gathered in Japan, it was Xi Jinping\u2019s turn to play host, in Xi\u2019an. At the first in-person meeting of a new group that China has dubbed the c+c5, he wooed Central\u2019s Asia\u2019s five leaders with a bonanza of investments, trade deals and knowledge transfers, to the tune of $3.8bn.\nCentral Asia is home to untapped natural gas and oil reserves, supplies of copper and uranium, and 10,300km of land borders with China and Russia. Outreach to the region has occupied Beijing and Moscow since the fall of the Soviet Union. But owing to uncertainty in Afghanistan and war in Ukraine, Chinese officials have taken a particular interest of late. Security was top of the agenda in Xi\u2019an, upsetting a long-term compromise in which the region\u2019s armed forces move in lockstep with Moscow while Beijing pulls the region\u2019s pursestrings by bankrolling colossal projects. \nThe prizes offered by Mr Xi add to a push already under way to strengthen China\u2019s economic ties with Central Asia. Beijing is involved in more than 90 industrial projects across the region. Turkmen gas alone accounts for more than 70% of the country\u2019s annual gas imports. In 2022 China was Central Asia\u2019s largest trading partner, as the value of imports and exports between the two parties rose to $70bn\u2014up more than 40% from the year before, according to official Chinese figures. By contrast, trade between Russia and Central Asia amounted to less than $40bn.\nMr Putin has stepped up his overtures, partly to counter Mr Xi. Russia has promised a slew of infrastructure investments. Competition is particularly fierce to build transport for the region\u2019s natural resources, many of which are trapped underground. In Xi\u2019an Mr Xi offered to construct a pipeline, the fourth of its kind, to ferry gas eastward from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Russia wants as much fuel as possible flowing through its borders in the Caspian and Central pipeline systems, which it has the power to turn on and off. In the words of an academic in Moscow, \u201cthere is a silent stand-off.\u201d \nMr Putin\u2019s diplomacy also has other motivations. Necessity has drawn Russia closer to its southern neighbours. War in Ukraine has left Mr Putin desperate to hold on to remaining allies, even though politicians in Central Asia have avoided openly supporting his invasion. Moscow is newly reliant on Central Asia to circumvent sanctions. Central bankers in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan help settle payments, using gold and roubles, for transactions that before the war would have been made using swift, a Western system. Logistics bosses and customs officials receive Russian exports before passing them on to Europe. Such intermediated trade counted for 4-6% of Kyrgyzstan\u2019s gdp last year.\nThe result is that Central Asia\u2019s economies are booming. Currencies in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have risen against the dollar since the war began, bucking an emerging-market trend. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a multilateral outfit, predicts that industries thriving on transporting Russian exports will contribute to gdp growth of 5.2% in the region this year, comfortably outstripping expectations. Capital, firms and people fleeing Russia, many of whom are highly educated, may well produce an even healthier 2024. \nFrenetic business has sent pay soaring, too. In November, annual real wage growth reached 10% in Uzbekistan and 7% in Kazakhstan, meaning the region\u2019s workers have seen more of a lift than those in any g7 country. Newly flush households will spend more on food and energy during Central Asia\u2019s freezing winters. Strong domestic demand has left the region\u2019s governments struggling to keep up. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan both paused gas exports in January, with a promise to bring them to a complete end by 2025. Whoever wins the charm offensive to build Central Asia\u2019s new pipelines may find there is no fuel available to fill them. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics,
