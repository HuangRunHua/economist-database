Media (cspm) might be the hottest state-owned textbook stock, ever. Shares in the company, which publishes titles such as \u201cGaseous Detonation Physics and its Universal Framework Theory\u201d, are up 230% since the start of the year. It is not the content, riveting though it is, that has lifted cspm\u2019s market capitalisation to nearly 30bn yuan ($4.3bn). Across the board, China\u2019s state-owned companies have enjoyed a renaissance\u2014at the request of regulators. Stop focusing on profits, authorities have insisted. Instead, think about firms\u2019 social contributions and their broader impact on the economy. All told, the \u201creconsideration\u201d of China\u2019s clunkiest firms has been worth 3trn yuan in the first five months of the year.\nThe success of the concept\u2014called the \u201cvaluation system with Chinese characteristics\u201d\u2014is quite the coup for the country\u2019s state capitalists. It suggests an ability to guide investment flows. First mentioned in November by Yi Huiman, head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the system\u2019s principles continue to evolve. At their core is the idea that standard valuation methods are poor at assessing state-owned companies because such firms adhere to central-government policies which seek to improve overall economic prosperity, not simply a firm\u2019s bottom line.\nChina\u2019s state-owned enterprises (soes) have a reputation for poor performance and stingy dividends. Their market valuations have reflected this. Part of the problem, say proponents of the new system, is that companies have communicated poorly with investors. Some have even asked analysts not to cover them. Now the firms should help investors understand their \u201cintrinsic values\u201d, Mr Yi has said. No method for doing this has been divulged, but investors speculate that these values include local employment and the hesitancy at many soes to lay off unproductive staff.\nThis sounds strikingly similar to what investors grudgingly call \u201cnational service\u201d, or sacrificing profits to boost economic growth. China\u2019s largest banks are often asked to do this by lowering interest rates on loans to risky borrowers\u2014defying all commercial logic\u2014in the hopes of spurring growth. Kweichow Moutai, a state-owned liquor-maker and one of China\u2019s most valuable listed firms, frequently spends on public works and has even started bailing out local governments in its province. By classic valuation models, this is all detrimental to shareholder value.\nThe biggest beneficiary of the new system may be pensioners. China faces a gaping shortfall in its ability to support the elderly. Poor demographics and an early retirement age are exacerbating the problem. Officials are transferring trillions of yuan in state-owned capital to the national pension fund as part of a reform process. A boost in the valuation of the firms could eventually help the state meet its pension obligations. The new valuation system, says Meng Lei of ubs, a bank, is an attempt to help investors understand the broader implications of this transfer of state-owned capital to pensioners. \nIs there a more traditional case for investment in companies such as cspm? After a surge of excitement this year, state firms\u2019 share prices are falling again. A new index tracking them is down by 11% since its peak on May 8th. The 291 state-owned shares that are included in the China coverage of msci, an index operator, trade at around six times forward earnings, or close to all-time lows, according to Goldman Sachs, a bank. This is about half the ratio for non-state companies. \nEven before the recent fall, soes were trading at a hefty discount. Officials now hope to match their fine words with actions. The regulator that oversees state assets recently switched its main gauge for evaluating company performance from net profits to return on equity. Analysts at cicc, a Chinese investment bank, reckon this might help lift capital returns and operating results. In which case, the interests of state capitalists and private investors would be better aligned than at present. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and
