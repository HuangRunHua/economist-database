"Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\n\nIn the late afternoon of May 22nd footage emerged of two grinning pro-Ukrainian fighters in the midst of a cross-border raid into Russia. \u201cThe key to the border has been broken in half,\u201d says one, quoting from \u201cEverything is Going to Plan\u201d, a cult anthem by Civil Defence, a Russian rock band. But the attack that the two men had helped engineer showed that, for Russia, things were very much not going to plan. It included: an illegal crossing from Ukraine into Belgorod, a Russian region on the border, by tanks and infantry fighting vehicles; the death of at least one border guard; farm buildings on fire; a downed helicopter; traffic jams of fleeing locals; and the reported evacuation of a nuclear-arms facility several kilometres into Russian territory. Who was responsible for the incursion?\n\nMembers of two militias that oppose Vladimir Putin\u2014the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Free Russia Legion\u2014claimed to have \u201cliberated\u201d several border villages. The groups appear to be based in Ukraine, from where they mount their attacks. Russia says that the militias are a front for the Ukrainian army; Ukraine insists that they are composed of Russian dissidents. The reality is somewhere in between. Both militias do indeed recruit disaffected Russian nationals. Both also co-ordinate their activities with hur, Ukraine\u2019s military-intelligence agency. Yet the groups have no formal connection to the Ukrainian government. That allows Ukrainian officials to distance themselves from the militias\u2019 operations, however implausibly.\nThe Kremlin sought to downplay the embarrassing security breach. Russian officials described it as an attempt by Ukraine to \u201cdeflect attention\u201d from what they claimed was their capture of the long-contested town of Bakhmut on May 20th (Ukraine says it still holds buildings and trenches on Bakhmut\u2019s south-western edge). On May 23rd the Russian defence ministry claimed to have killed or expelled all the militia fighters from Belgorod, though it provided no evidence.\nA Ukrainian intelligence source offers a more realistic assessment. Two ideas underpinned the operation in Belgorod, he says. The first was to undermine Mr Putin\u2019s domestic authority: if a strongman can\u2019t guarantee security, what is the point of him? The second was to pull Russian military reserves away from critical sections of the front line, in the run-up to a long-planned Ukrainian counter-offensive. \nThis is not the first foray by Ukraine-backed militias into Russian territory. The Free Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps were formed last year, under opaque circumstances, but came to prominence this March when they spearheaded an incursion from Ukraine into Bryansk, another border region. Russia claimed that two civilians were killed in that attack, but offered no proof.\nThe two militias differ in organisation and ideology. The Free Russia Legion is more chaotic and closer to hur; the Russian Volunteer Corps is better disciplined but has far-right leanings. Andrei Chernak, a spokesman for HUR, says that the \u201cexistential\u201d danger Ukraine faces means that it cannot be too choosy about whom it collaborates with. Survival is Ukraine\u2019s only focus, he said. \u201cWe are prepared to work with everyone.\u201d \u25a0", "description": "They have links to Ukrainian military intelligence and, in some cases, to
