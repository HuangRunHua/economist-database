country\u2019s LGBT support groups are forced to close, one by one. This campaign of repression reveals a lot about President Xi Jinping\u2019s China, a paranoid place in which security agencies and ideological commissars enjoy ever-greater clout. \nFor the same message is delivered, time and again, whenever policemen question gay-rights advocates (and sometimes their family members). It is heard when university chiefs punish students for handing out rainbow flags, or when officials press landlords to evict non-profit groups. The message is that sexual minorities pose a political risk. True, some officials and state-backed scholars also call same-sex love an affront to mainstream Chinese morality, and a threat to young people whose patriotic duty is to marry and have more babies for the Motherland. But activists report that, during interrogations, national security is emphasised much more than morality. Despite the political chill, gay people (as well as bars and dating apps) enjoy far more tolerance than they did a generation ago\u2014but only if they keep it quiet. In today\u2019s China, forming a community is a graver offence than being gay. \nThe latest casualty, the Beijing LGBT Centre, announced its closure on May 15th, citing forces beyond its control. Over 15 years in existence the centre had some high-profile successes, including a court victory in 2014 against a clinic offering electroshock therapy to \u201cconvert\u201d gay patients. \nActivists talk of their cause being set back a decade or more. Within living memory, China denounced homosexuality as a mental illness imported by foreigners. Criminal penalties for gay sex were abolished only in 1997. During a first posting to Beijing in 2000, Chaguan heard a foreign government minister report, with disbelief, the claim of a Chinese counterpart that there were no gay men in China. Remarkable changes followed. Activists worked to persuade Chinese officials that social stability\u2014the party\u2019s great obsession\u2014is strengthened by their activities. Some state media and institutions seemed to agree, offering praise for health-education campaigns or HIV-prevention work done by gay groups. \nBy 2019, your columnist could meet a gay couple in a Guangzhou cafe as they cheerfully described their plans to register as one another\u2019s legal guardians. This baby step towards gay marriage took advantage of a law initially drafted with the elderly in mind. Later it was adapted by creative lawyers to let same-sex couples take medical and some financial decisions for each other, should they grow infirm, undergo surgery or otherwise lose their faculties. That same year, over 180,000 members of the public submitted comments to legislators drafting new regulations on marriage in China\u2019s civil code. Many suggested changing \u201chusband and wife\u201d to \u201cspouses\u201d as a first step towards same-sex marriage. A large number of petitioners were mobilised by legal-rights groups such as LGBT Rights Advocacy China. Since then, that petition drive backing same-sex unions has been cited by Chinese diplomats abroad as proof that their country allows free speech and bans discrimination against gay people, most recently at a hearing this February of a UN rights committee. What those smooth-talking envoys did not mention is that, back at home, civil society groups behind that self-same petition have been shut down, including LGBT Rights Advocacy China, which closed in 2021.\nLarge companies have bowed to political pressures, too. In 2020 a state-owned airline, China Southern, fired a gay flight attendant seen kissing a male pilot on a surveillance video that went viral on social media. The airline told an employment court that the attendant might provoke mid-air disturbances if passengers recognised him from the video. In 2021 WeChat, the omnipresent messaging, e-commerce and social media app,  closed dozens of accounts on LGBT topics, especially those run by university students. In recent years, regulators have banned \u201ceffeminate men\u201d from television shows, and denounced \u201cboys\u2019 love\u201d dramas, a genre involving thinly disguised homo-erotic themes. \nGay groups worked hard to avoid trouble. As a young Malaysian studying in China, Raymond Phang helped to co-found ShanghaiPRIDE, an organiser of gay celebrations and events. He and fellow volunteers grew used to assuring police that events would not feature political statements from foreign diplomats, or touch on such sensitive topics as Taiwan. No public parades or outdoor gatherings were attempted. The group eschewed slogans like \u201cGay Rights Now\u201d, says Mr Phang. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that in the mainland, it\u2019s more about awareness, and \u2018LGBT is not a sickness\u2019.\u201d He calls ShanghaiPRIDE lucky, because none of its volunteers or staff was taken into custody for 24 or 48 hours, as happened to some groups. Even so, the frequency of official visits became exhausting. In 2020, ShanghaiPRIDE announced that it was cancelling all activities.\nOther groups were forced to close to secure the release of an organiser in detention, says a veteran campaigner now outside China. As spaces to talk about shared challenges vanish, the young are feeling isolated, he worries. \u201cLGBT student groups or associations have become very underground.\u201d\nTyrannies distrust minorities\nAlas, in the party\u2019s bleak logic, being vulnerable is grounds for suspicion. Early in the Xi era in 2012, Geremie Barm\u00e9, an Australian Sinologist, highlighted an essay published in the People\u2019s Daily by Yuan Peng, an expert on America and later head of a think-tank affiliated with the ministry of state security. Mr Yuan identified five groups that America might use to infiltrate Chinese society: rights lawyers, underground religious activitists, dissidents, internet leaders and\u2014most chillingly\u2014ruoshi qunti or \u201cvulnerable groups\u201d. A decade on, gay groups, feminists, labour activists and ethnic minorities are all treated as potential tools of subversion by a hostile West. In Mr Xi\u2019s China, the marginalised represent a security threat, not an object for compassion.\u25a0\nRead more from Chaguan, our columnist on China:\nChina learns to manage decline (May
