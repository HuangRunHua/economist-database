Illumina, a genomics giant with a market value of $34bn. Mr Icahn\u2019s modest stake belies his ambition. As the elder statesman of activist investing, the 87-year-old aims to convert small shareholdings into considerable influence. Mr Icahn has nominated three directors to the board of Illumina, whose share price has fallen by 60% since its peak in 2021, in part owing to hubristic dealmaking. On May 25th, after The Economist was published, Mr Icahn\u2019s colourful campaign against the firm\u2019s bosses (16 letters, drawing on Shakespeare and Lincoln) will reach a climax at its annual general meeting. It is one of the hottest tickets in this year\u2019s \u201cproxy season\u201d, when most American firms elect their boards of directors.\nAfter a dismal year, when activist funds lost 16% of their value as stockmarkets slumped, many observers were expecting a spring offensive. Fund managers had a busy end to 2022, taking advantage of those sunken stockmarket valuations. New corporate-governance rules introduced last September make it easier for dissident investors to obtain board seats, by compelling firms to include all nominees on proxy ballots and allowing shareholders to mix and match those proposed by the company and by its detractors, rather than pick alternative slates. \u201cAsked in December, I would have said this is going to be a proxy season for the ages,\u201d says Kai Liekefett of Sidley Austin, a law firm. \nFive months on things are, at first blush, looking less epochal. In the first quarter of 2023 the number of new activist campaigns in America was a third lower than a year earlier, according to Lazard, an investment bank. With dealmaking at its most subdued in a decade, \u201ctransactional\u201d funds, shorter-term investors which agitate for anything from spin-offs of units to the sale of the whole company, are finding little traction. Few big-ticket fights made it to contested votes for board spots. \nYet the quietude may be deceiving. For one thing, many targets, worried that the new rules favour activists, have sought a truce rather than risk a painful proxy brawl. In February Trian, an activist outfit run by Nelson Peltz, ended its battle against Disney after the entertainment behemoth presented a restructuring plan.  Elliott Management, another activist giant, called off plans to nominate directors to the board of Salesforce in March, two months after the software firm appointed the boss of ValueAct, another well-known fund, to its board. This month Shake Shack, a fast-food retailer, announced a settlement agreement with Engaged Capital, a smaller activist fund. Such truces may be less entertaining for outside observers than Mr Icahn\u2019s antics, but for the activists they are wins nonetheless. \nFifteen years of rock-bottom interest rates and cheap money have created a target-rich environment. As the cost of capital rises, activists spy plenty of management teams that could do with more discipline. On May 11th Elliott revealed it owned 10% of Goodyear, a tyremaker with a market value of around $4bn, along with a plan to sell retail stores and bolster margins. Four days later the hedge fund announced a 13% interest in NRG, an $8bn energy company, calling its recent acquisition of Vivint, a home-security firm, \u201cthe single worst deal\u201d the power-and-utilities sector has seen in the past decade. Both campaigns attempt to focus managers\u2019 minds and streamline the companies\u2019 operations. The share prices of Goodyear and NRG jumped by 21% and 3%, respectively, on the news of Elliott\u2019s stakes.\nActivists are also pursuing larger prey. Campaigns involving companies with market capitalisations above $50bn made up a record share of activity during the first quarter of 2023. Some funds are taking aim at technology firms, which accounted for a quarter of campaigns in America last year. Tech\u2019s retreat from the pandemic-induced boom in all things digital presents activists with an opportunity to force cost-cutting or shedding unprofitable businesses. Technology giants\u2019 vast market capitalisations\u2014Salesforce is worth $200bn\u2014allow activists to deploy large sums without passing ownership thresholds that would trigger disclosures of their stakes before they are ready to launch the public-facing part of their campaigns.\nNot even the biggest of big tech, hitherto largely spared the activists\u2019 rod, is safe. This month Pershing Square and Third Point, two hedge funds, revealed investments in Alphabet, Google\u2019s $1.5trn parent company. Third Point insists its stake is not an activist campaign. It and Pershing may still benefit from the earlier efforts of TCI, another fund already on the warpath against Alphabet\u2019s high costs and cash-burning moonshots. \nAmerican activists will also increasingly export their version of shareholder capitalism abroad. In addition to large regional players, such as Cevian Capital in Europe, high-profile American fund managers have become familiar faces in the world\u2019s business circles, making it easier for them to engage with other shareholders. Even as new campaigns in America languished at the start of the year, activity in Europe and Asia has surged.\nTake Japan. Many of those who picked fights there in the past, like T. Boone Pickens, a corporate raider who took on Koito Manufacturing in the 1980s, or TCI, which in 2008 dropped its investment in J-Power, an electric utility, came back bruised. Now, thanks to corporate-governance reforms over the past decade, Japan Inc has had no choice but to become more receptive. New stockmarket guidelines will go so far as to ask companies worth less than the book value of their equity to disclose their initiatives for improvement. \nActivists do not always prevail. On May 25th ValueAct lost a proxy battle to elect four directors to the board of Seven & i, the Japanese conglomerate which owns the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores. This month Mr Icahn himself became the target of an activist attack. A short-seller, Hindenburg Research, claims that his listed vehicle, Icahn Enterprises, is overvalued. In response to the assault, Mr Icahn denied Hindenburg\u2019s allegations and defended the style of investing he pioneered. Activists, he argued, \u201cbreach the walls\u201d of badly run companies. Whether or not Mr Icahn\u2019s own firm deserves activist treatment, plenty of others certainly do. \u25a0\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom
