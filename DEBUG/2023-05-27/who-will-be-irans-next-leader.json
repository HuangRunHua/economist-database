Ruhollah Khomeini, the charismatic leader of Iran\u2019s Islamic revolution, died in 1989, hundreds of thousands of mourners packed the streets, fearful of what might happen next. Nowadays the mood is very different. For more than six months Iranians have been demonstrating en masse, chanting death to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the founder\u2019s ailing successor as supreme leader. Yet no one knows who might fill his shoes when he goes\u2014or whether the Middle East\u2019s last theocracy will actually survive.\nDespite several cancer scares, the 84-year-old may hang on for years yet. But doubts about his health\u2014and the strength of his system, the Velayat-e Faqih, or rule of the cleric\u2014are growing. Even religious-minded Iranians have begun to lose faith in theocracy.\nThe regime is patently unpopular. Elections have long been a charade. Non-alignment in foreign policy looks increasingly phoney as the regime snuggles up to China and Russia. The succession is bound to shake the status quo, says Pejman Abdolmohammadi of the University of Trento in Italy. \u201cIt could speed up a full authoritarian takeover or spark a democratic transition.\u201d\nOn paper the succession should be smooth. As things stand, the supreme leader has the final say on all matters of state, making him far superior to the president, who is elected under undemocratic conditions every four years. The supreme leader, by contrast, is picked by an assembly of 88 clerics. If this turbaned elite is unsure whom to choose, a triumvirate composed of the president, the chief justice and a senior jurist decides and a referendum confirms their choice. In 1989 the triumvirate, including a son of Mr Khomeini, wangled Mr Khamenei, a middle-ranking cleric who was already the president, into the job behind the assembly\u2019s back. A constitutional referendum duly followed. \nThree decades later, Mr Khamenei has shrunk from naming a successor. Meanwhile the regime has been rocked by demonstrations and dissent after the death last September of a young woman in the custody of the so-called morality police. \nThe two prime contenders have even weaker religious pedigrees than Mr Khamenei\u2019s. Ebrahim Raisi, formerly the chief justice and now an arch-reactionary president, spent a relatively short time studying in seminaries. \u201cHe\u2019s only as qualified as a mosque imam,\u201d says Mustafa Fahas, a Shia Muslim academic in Lebanon who monitors events in Iran. Mr Raisi\u2019s father-in-law is an ultra-conservative cleric who, among other things, wants to ban music. This alienates him from most Iranians.\nThe other front-runner is Mr Khamenei\u2019s second son, Mojtaba. He runs the supreme leader\u2019s office and is close to Hossein Taib, until recently the powerful intelligence chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the regime\u2019s praetorian body. Mr Khamenei junior has lately been hailed on state TV as an ayatollah, the clergy\u2019s highest rank, but has never held an official post and is rarely seen in public. Many regime stalwarts dislike the prospect of a dynastic succession: their revolution was founded on the overthrow of a shah. \nThe big new factor, compared with the situation in 1989, is the rise of the IRGC. It now has the whip-hand over the clerics. For three decades Mr Khamenei has built up its power as a defence against his rivals among the clergy\u2014and against the risk of opposition in the street. The IRGC\u2019s membership in parliament has risen from 6% in 1980 (a year after the revolution) to 26% today, according to  Chatham House, a think-tank in London, while clerical representation has dropped from 52% to 11%. The clergy used to post clerics to IRGC units; now the IRGC trains its own clerics and posts them to the seminaries, says Ali Alfoneh, an expert in America who wrote a book about Iran\u2019s leadership succession.\nAs the IRGC has gained strength, many Iran-watchers think its commanders could keep the supreme leader in place but reduce him to a figurehead.  It might prefer Mr Raisi as \u201ca useful idiot who fits the bill\u201d, says Saied Golkar, another Iran expert in America. The IRGC could conceivably take charge and junk clerical rule altogether, replacing it with an equally authoritarian alternative. The IRGC may be more pragmatic than the ruling clergy and try harder not to clash with the already disgruntled middle class.  In foreign policy, however, it could be just as forceful, dropping Mr Khamenei\u2019s vaunted fatwa against nuclear weapons and openly racing to build a nuclear bomb. While continuing to oppose America\u2019s presence in the Gulf, it may nonetheless be more flexible in negotiating with \u201cthe Great Satan\u201d.\nSome argue that the IRGC could impose a new social contract whereby Iranians would have more freedom to dress, drink and dance as they pleased. Iran might have a female education minister, the first in over 40 years. (An Islamist firing squad killed the last one, in 1980.) Political freedom, however, would shrink still more. \nThat process may have begun. The morality police often leave unveiled women alone. But repression against dissent and crime is as harsh as ever. Executions rose last year by more than 80%, to 576. If an authoritarian IRGC regime were to bring back stability while relaxing personal mores, many Iranians might accept it. \nBut true reformists would surely bid for a secular civilian system, rather than rule by either the IRGC or the clergy. Earlier this year, a former president, Muhammad Khatami, called for \u201ca fundamental transformation\u201d. A popular former presidential candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, broke his silence after 12 years of house arrest to call for a referendum on whether to keep Iran as an Islamic republic. \nWhatever the shape of the transition, it could well be messy. Only one thing is certain, says Mr Fahas, who is close to clerics within the regime. Mr Khamenei will be \u201cthe last real faqih\u201d. In other words, rule by clerics as envisaged by the 1979 revolution\u2019s founding father will be over.  \u25a0", "description": "Nobody knows who might grab the reins of power", "ogDescription":
