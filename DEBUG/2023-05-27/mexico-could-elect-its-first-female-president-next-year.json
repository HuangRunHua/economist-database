The coalition is running again, but no one contender has emerged, while their main message is that they are not Morena. \u201cWe need to do more than be the option that voters hold their nose to vote for,\u201d says Fernando Belaunzar\u00e1n, a former PRD lawmaker. \n\nCitizens\u2019 Movement, a left-wing party that holds the governorships of Jalisco and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, two important states, has a well-liked figure in Luis Donaldo Colosio, the son of a popular reformist PRI presidential candidate who was murdered in 1994. However, he has said he will not run. Mr Ebrard would be competitive were he to break with Morena, but few reckon he will.\nIf Ms Sheinbaum becomes president, how different would she be from her mentor? So far, she appears to be sticking fairly closely to Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s contradictory ideology. It is hard to imagine that the mayor, who holds a doctorate in energy engineering, agrees with the president\u2019s approach of favouring the national oil and power companies over clean and cheap power. But she has defended this signature part of the president\u2019s platform. Similarly, Ms Sheinbaum has blamed \u201cneoliberal\u201d economic policy for Mexico\u2019s inequality and criticised the electoral body. She may be tempted to follow Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s lead and boost social handouts that buy loyalty but do not solve poverty.\nSome policies would be hard to reverse. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has deepened the involvement of the armed forces in fighting crime. He has also handed over 70 civilian functions to them, according to a study by Mexico United Against Crime, an NGO. Soldiers now control the ports and customs facilities, and will build, run and keep the profits from airports and a new tourist train. Ms Sheinbaum is unlikely to be able to remove these privileges, even if she wanted to. But she has also used the same playbook: she deployed the National Guard, a notionally civilian organisation that has replaced the federal police, to help run Mexico City\u2019s subway system after several crashes in 2021, to the outrage of subway workers. \n Waiting in the wings\n\nIt is doubtful, however, that Ms Sheinbaum will continue Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s attempts to undermine the Supreme Court. Partly that is because she will not enjoy his political strength. She will find it harder to lead Morena, which is more a fan club for Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador than a political party. She is also likely to preside over a more divided Congress: analysts predict 2024 will mirror midterm elections in 2021 when Morena lost ground, including its coalition\u2019s congressional supermajority. \nHeir today, gone tomorrow\nIt is also a matter of personality. Ms Sheinbaum is nowhere near as inflammatory as her boss, who takes aim at critics from hours-long daily press conferences. She is a \u201cvery different figure\u201d from the president, says Patricia Mercado, a senator for Citizens\u2019 Movement. Even so, some worry that Ms Sheinbaum will merely be Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s proxy. The president says that he will retire to his ranch after stepping down at the end of 2024. But if Morena were to somehow win a supermajority in 2024, he has pledged to use his last month in power, when his successor is president-elect, to pass constitutional reforms that have already been rejected by the Supreme Court. Whether or not he remains on the political scene, his influence on Mexico will be felt for years to come. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "The race to succeed AMLO", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "The Americas"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/u9avqma9ca3p14gs9dp3hjvt3ebg1mr5", "tegID": "u9avqma9ca3p14gs9dp3hjvt3ebg1mr5", "headline": "The Americas", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/05/25/lula-wants-to-purge-brazil-of-jair-bolsonaros-influence", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/8hh7as6o6dred0tqepoil3lq8j7rls7o", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Lula wants to purge Brazil of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s influence", "subheadline": "A power struggle", "datePublished": "2023-05-25T12:59:03Z", "description": "He faces resistance from evangelicals, gun owners and big tech", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230527_AMP003.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/05/23/mexico-could-elect-its-first-female-president-next-year", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/j183nl9dvmnbu9v13h5v7qnrvbv4bhsu", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Mexico could elect its first female president next year", "subheadline": "The race to succeed AMLO", "datePublished": "2023-05-23T20:03:33Z", "description": "Will Claudia Sheinbaum be overshadowed by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador?", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230527_AMP001.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/05/18/latin-americas-left-wing-experiment-is-a-warning-to-the-world", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/u014bf9ohmiblbb2kfvia0eb561ao27f", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Latin America\u2019s left-wing experiment is a warning to the world", "subheadline": "A polarising pendulum", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T12:47:35Z", "description": "The region has some of the most left-leaning politicians on the planet.

"Article", "articleBody": "On June 4th voters in the state of Mexico, the most populous in the country of the same name, will elect a new governor. The vote is widely seen as a testing ground for general elections due next year. Delfina G\u00f3mez, a former education minister, is polling far ahead of her rival. If she wins, it will suggest her party, Morena, is well positioned for next year\u2019s polls. Morena was founded by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico\u2019s leader. He cannot run again. As a result the presidential vote next year could see another woman win big: Claudia Sheinbaum, the mayor of Mexico City. She would be the first female head of state. But she could struggle to shake off the legacy of Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador, her mentor.\nWhen Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador won the election in 2018, with 53% of the vote, it appeared to mark a sea-change in Mexican politics. For decades the country had been dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), a centre-right party that ruled Mexico for 71 years until 2000. Opposition had been provided by the National Action Party (PAN), a conservative group that held the presidency for two terms from 2000 to 2012, and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), a left-wing outfit. By 2018 many voters fed up with the status quo felt hopeful that Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador could deliver change. He promised to end corruption, reduce inequality and tackle gang violence. \nOnce in power Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador began executing his political project, a contradictory mix of policies he grandly calls the \u201cFourth Transformation\u201d. They combine a penchant for 1970s-style nationalism with fiscal hawkishness. Although the president\u2019s rhetoric sounds left-wing, his policies are a more complicated mix. He did away with Mexico\u2019s health-care system for the uninsured, scrapped child-care subsidies for working mothers and canned a conditional cash programme for the poor. \nHis main instinct is statism. The president boosted the state oil and electricity companies at the expense of clean energy, including by building a new oil refinery. He also wants to nationalise Mexico\u2019s lithium. He handed sweeping power to the armed forces, and has tried to undermine the Supreme Court and the electoral body. On May 19th he expropriated a railway from Grupo M\u00e9xico, a mining company. On May 24th Citigroup, an American bank, announced it would abandon a deal to sell Banamex, a Mexican retail bank, to Grupo M\u00e9xico. It was unclear if Grupo M\u00e9xico had pulled out because of the expropriation, or if Citibank had decided not to go ahead because of frequent comments made by the president in public about the sale.\n\nDespite this ideological ragbag of policies, the president is popular. Fully 65% of survey respondents approve of him. That is higher than any recent Mexican president at a similar point in their terms (see chart). Many investors are put off by Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador. But the country is faring better than other countries in Latin America, such as Brazil. Its proximity to the United States helps, making it a beneficiary of \u201cfriend-shoring\u201d, as do Mexico\u2019s 13 trade agreements with 50 countries.\nMs Sheinbaum is not the only contender to be Morena\u2019s candidate for the presidency. Her closest rival is Marcelo Ebrard, the foreign minister. He is \u201cthe firefighter-in-chief\u201d for Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government, says someone close to him. His ministry leads talks with the United States on everything from migration to energy. After Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador initially refused to condemn Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it was Mr Ebrard who reassured President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that Mexico remained an ally. His diplomacy also ensured that Mexico received vaccines during the pandemic. Until recently, he was better known among Mexicans than Ms Sheinbaum.\nHowever, Ms Sheinbaum enjoys a widening lead over Mr Ebrard. Opinion polls place her eight percentage points ahead of him. It helps that she is the president\u2019s preferred candidate. For several months Morena\u2019s activists have plastered signs declaring \u201cEs Claudia\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s Claudia\u201d) across the country\u2014possibly in violation of Mexico\u2019s strict campaign laws. \nHer nomination seems assured. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador says Morena\u2019s candidate will be decided by two surveys this summer. But concerns abound about their fairness, such as over which company will run them and what questions the public will be asked. Many worry, including some within Morena, that the process will be akin to that under the PRI, when the leader chose his successor, a process known as the dedazo, or big finger. \u201cThis is the dedazo in disguise,\u201d says Mariel Ibarra, a journalist. \nA tricky inheritance\nBut Ms Sheinbaum is a competitive figure in her own right, too. Mayors of Mexico City enjoy national prominence because they govern 7% of the country\u2019s 126m people, who generate 15% of its GDP. For the most part she has done a good job. On her watch murders almost halved between 2018 and 2022, compared with a national fall of 8%. She has attempted to clean up the state police force by paying them a decent wage. In a country where politicians are dogged by allegations of graft, she is seen as clean. \nMs Sheinbaum tends to take a rational approach to policymaking. Unlike the president, she surrounds herself with competent people and is willing to take advice. During the pandemic she quietly distanced herself from Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador, relying on data, masks and free tests to control covid-19 while he declared, mask-free from his pulpit, that there was no need to worry. (Mexico\u2019s absolute death toll was among the highest in the world.) Over the past five years her administration has built centres around the capital to help poor people to study and to access services.\nAssuming she secures the candidacy, the election looks like Ms Sheinbaum\u2019s to lose. In 2018 the three main opposition parties (the PRI, PAN and PRD) formed a coalition known as Va por M\u00e9xico. The coalition is running again, but no one contender has emerged, while their main message is that they are not Morena. \u201cWe need to do more than be the option that voters hold their nose to vote for,\u201d says Fernando Belaunzar\u00e1n, a former PRD lawmaker. \n\nCitizens\u2019 Movement, a left-wing party that holds the governorships of Jalisco and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, two important states, has a well-liked figure in Luis Donaldo Colosio, the son of a popular reformist PRI presidential candidate who was murdered in 1994. However, he has said he will not run. Mr Ebrard would be competitive were he to break with Morena, but few reckon he will.\nIf Ms Sheinbaum becomes president, how different would she be from her mentor? So far, she appears to be sticking fairly closely to Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s contradictory ideology. It is hard to imagine that the mayor, who holds a doctorate in energy engineering, agrees with the president\u2019s approach of favouring the national oil and power companies over clean and cheap power. But she has defended this signature part of the president\u2019s platform. Similarly, Ms Sheinbaum has blamed \u201cneoliberal\u201d economic policy for Mexico\u2019s inequality and criticised the electoral body. She may be tempted to follow Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s lead and boost social handouts that buy loyalty but do not solve poverty.\nSome policies would be hard to reverse. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has deepened the involvement of the armed forces in fighting crime. He has also handed over 70 civilian functions to them, according to a study by Mexico United Against Crime, an NGO. Soldiers now control the ports and customs facilities, and will build, run and keep the profits from airports and a new tourist train. Ms Sheinbaum is unlikely to be able to remove these privileges, even if she wanted to. But she has also used the same playbook: she deployed the National Guard, a notionally civilian organisation that has replaced the federal police, to help run Mexico City\u2019s subway system after several crashes in 2021, to the outrage of subway workers. \n Waiting in the wings\n\nIt is doubtful, however, that Ms Sheinbaum will continue Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s attempts to undermine the Supreme Court. Partly that is because she will not enjoy his political strength. She will find it harder to lead Morena, which is more a fan club for Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador than a political party. She is also likely to preside over a more divided Congress: analysts predict 2024 will mirror midterm elections in 2021 when Morena lost ground, including its coalition\u2019s congressional supermajority. \nHeir today, gone tomorrow\nIt is also a matter of personality. Ms Sheinbaum is nowhere near as inflammatory as her boss, who takes aim at critics from hours-long daily press conferences. She is a \u201cvery different figure\u201d from the president, says Patricia Mercado, a senator for Citizens\u2019 Movement. Even so, some worry that Ms Sheinbaum will merely be Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s proxy. The president says that he will retire to his ranch after stepping down at the end of 2024. But if Morena were to somehow win a supermajority in 2024, he has pledged to use his last month in power, when his successor is president-elect, to pass constitutional reforms that have already been rejected by the Supreme Court. Whether or not he remains on the political scene, his influence on Mexico will be felt for years to come. \u25a0", "description": "Will Claudia Sheinbaum be overshadowed by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador?", "ogDescription": "Will Claudia Sheinbaum be overshadowed by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador?", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230527_AMP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-05-23T20:03:33Z", "dateModified": "2023-05-25T13:11:23Z", "dateCreated": "2023-05-23T20:03:12Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-05-27T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "Mexico City", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/8hh7as6o6dred0tqepoil3lq8j7rls7o", "publication": [{"id": "/content/0ahcf9cn8l22qr8nr6rfn2sqtc5d9h59", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/134udl9j50scig3q9m2516gr6q75r5mr", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/s413ogt6tm4l7t13gh0psj7t0ov54lno", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r148cgbtpn8r95kap4kb814ldbbofc2c", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/a9saae6o0e109j8560qfqj82kogau71b", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/o04190oq39a9tue8vjis18ius96kn1mk", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/23ni04hsk3d1ahu1j20tqnjho7tfj36o", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/050fcck58a4kilbnqmp37mdbrsnsiup8", "context": {"position": 600.28, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Lula wants to purge Brazil of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s influence", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/05/25/lula-wants-to-purge-brazil-of-jair-bolsonaros-influence", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/j183nl9dvmnbu9v13h5v7qnrvbv4bhsu", "publication": [{"id": "/content/0ahcf9cn8l22qr8nr6rfn2sqtc5d9h59", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/134udl9j50scig3q9m2516gr6q75r5mr", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/s413ogt6tm4l7t13gh0psj7t0ov54lno", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/r148cgbtpn8r95kap4kb814ldbbofc2c", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/a9saae6o0e109j8560qfqj82kogau71b", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/o04190oq39a9tue8vjis18ius96kn1mk", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/23ni04hsk3d1ahu1j20tqnjho7tfj36o", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/050fcck58a4kilbnqmp37mdbrsnsiup8", "context": {"position": 600.27, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Mexico could elect its first female president next year", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/05/23/mexico-could-elect-its-first-female-president-next-year", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
