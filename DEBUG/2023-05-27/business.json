The core rate of inflation, stripping out energy and food, rose again to 6.8%; food prices were up by 19.1%. The yield on British government bonds jumped as markets bet that interest rates would increase further. Earlier, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, admitted that there are \u201cbig lessons to learn\u201d from the failure of the bank\u2019s economic models to predict the persistence of high inflation. \nAn updated estimate of Germany\u2019s GDP in the first quarter showed the economy shrinking by 0.3% over the previous three months. That means that Germany is technically in a recession, as the economy contracted by 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. \nThe European Union slapped a \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn) fine on Meta, the owner of Facebook, for breaching rules on the transfer of personal data from the EU to America. It is the biggest penalty imposed by the EU on a company for privacy violations. The decision gives Meta six months to stop processing data in America that it holds on EU citizens. Meta described the actions as \u201cunjustified\u201d and said it would appeal against the fine. \nChina banned memory chips made by Micron, an American company, from being used in the country\u2019s infrastructure development, a tit-for-tat move in response to America\u2019s prohibition on Chinese technology. China claimed Micron\u2019s chips \u201cposed significant security risks\u201d. America has reportedly asked South Korea to dissuade Samsung and SK Hynix, which make similar chips to Micron, from filling the gap in the Chinese market that will be left by Micron\u2019s absence. \nTikTok filed a lawsuit against Montana for its decision to ban the social-media app, the first statewide prohibition of TikTok in America. The Chinese firm argues that the ban is unconstitutional, and that Montana\u2019s claim that TikTok shares data with the Chinese government is based on \u201cunfounded speculation\u201d. \nApple announced an agreement in which Broadcom, a big American maker of semiconductors, will supply 5G components for the iPhone. Sensitive to claims that it relies on China for the assembly of its devices, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said that all \u201cof Apple\u2019s products depend on technology engineered and built here\u201d in the United States. \nChina overtook Japan as the world\u2019s biggest exporter of cars in the first quarter, mostly because of its expanding production of electric vehicles. China exported more than 1m vehicles in total during the three months, compared with Japan\u2019s 950,000. \nLady Luck smiles again\nThere was more evidence that Macau\u2019s gambling industry is on the rebound from covid and a crackdown on betting by the authorities. Galaxy Entertainment, which owns hotels and casinos in the Chinese territory, said its net revenues were 72% higher in the first quarter than a year earlier. Other resort operators have reported similar results. Macau\u2019s casinos are now focused on catering to ordinary punters, rather than the high rollers who attracted the ire of officials. \nCitigroup abandoned plans to find a buyer for Banamex, a bank chain in Mexico that it bought in 2001, and will instead spin off the business in an IPO, probably in 2025. \nShell\u2019s annual general meeting was seriously disrupted by climate-change protesters. Led by green investors, 20% of the shareholders present rejected the company\u2019s energy-transition plan, claiming its timetable for reducing fossil-fuel production is too slow. \nFacing what it described as \u201cvolatile circumstances\u201d, Target removed some products related to LGBT pride from its stores. The retailer said that in some cases customers have confronted staff over the merchandise. The pride range includes books aimed at young children with titles such as \u201cI\u2019m Not a Girl\u201d and \u201cThe Pronoun Book\u201d. \nVirgin Orbit was wound down, less than two months after filing for bankruptcy protection. A sale of the rocket-launch company\u2019s assets fetched just $36m, around 1% of the $3.7bn it was valued at when it floated on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 2021. \nThe terminator\nNetflix began its long-trailed crackdown on sharing passwords. The streaming giant sent emails to subscribers in 100 countries reminding them that only one household can watch Netflix on a single account. Viewers will get prompts when they tune in; those who share passwords outside the household will be booted off. The decision to get tough now has nothing to do with the company\u2019s PR naming Arnold Schwarzenegger as a new \u201cchief action officer\u201d.", "description": "", "ogDescription": "", "imageUrl":
