"type": "Article", "articleBody": "WHEN China launched a campaign of economic coercion against Australia in 2020, Communist Party bosses thought they had crushing leverage. The economies of the two countries\u2014resource-rich Australia and commodities-hungry China\u2014were complementary and closely connected. By massively curbing shipments of everything from timber to coal, lobsters, barley and wine, on pretexts including exaggerated concerns about trade practices and pest infestations, China imposed a A$24bn ($16bn) hit on Australia, representing 5.5% of its total annual exports. Yet it did not succumb. And like a surfer surviving a shark attack with no more than a lightly gnawed board, Australia is now emerging from three years of Chinese bullying in remarkably good shape. \nIts exports briefly suffered under the strictures, then surged\u2014culminating last year in Australia\u2019s biggest-ever trade surplus, equivalent to more than 7% of gDP. And the trade blocks, imposed after Australia\u2019s then-conservative government dared call for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, are coming off. On May 18th, after a meeting between the two countries\u2019 trade ministers in Beijing, China lifted a de facto ban on Australian timber. (\u201cSerious study\u201d by quarantine officials had allayed its concerns about bug infestation, explained Xiao Qian, China\u2019s ambassador in Canberra.) Since January, Chinese importers have been quietly buying Australian coal: in the first quarter of 2023 Australia sent them A$1.2bn-worth of the stuff. Australia\u2019s centre-left Labor government says cotton and copper exports are also resuming. China is reviewing tariffs on barley, Australia having suspended its case against them at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). \n\nAfter years of unchecked Chinese bullying, on Asia\u2019s seas, in its multilateral forums and beyond, Australia\u2019s escape is being widely understood as a significant win. And so it is. Yet it involved, as well as strong nerves, a large dose of luck.\nChinese leaders were only half-right. As their boycott began, Australia\u2019s economy was indeed reliant on China. Exports of goods and services to China accounted for 11% of outbound trade in 2005. By 2020, the share stood at 37%. Mitigating its reliance, Australia\u2019s bet on China was chiefly a wager on international trade. Australia has relatively few multinationals that manufacture and sell inside China. But even without vast China-based subsidiaries, Australia was vulnerable. The Economist\u2019s in-house index of China exposure adds goods exports to China, services exports to China and Hong Kong, and the revenue of foreign multinationals\u2019 affiliates operating in China and Hong Kong. Australia\u2019s exposure, at 8.2% of GDP in 2020, was double that of America, and close to that of Germany.\nLuckily for Australia, however, the two economies were such a good fit that China\u2019s firms felt as much pain from the curbs as Australia\u2019s, if not more. And some commodities, such as Australian iron ore, were so hard to replace China chose not to target them. Also luckily, many of Australia\u2019s bruised exporters found other markets.\nAfter China slapped a tariff of up to 80% on Australian barley, its producers sold it to South-East Asian countries. They also planted other crops. And Chinese beer-makers had to buy other countries\u2019 barley, which was not as good. When China blocked shipments of Australian coal, similarly, it had to buy more from Russia and Indonesia. That left India and Japan short, so Australia sold to them. Meanwhile, rising world prices made Australian miners lots of money. Australian pain, though not insignificant, was concentrated: lobster fishermen struggled; wine exports to China\u2019s middle classes plunged.\nAustralia\u2019s efforts to manage the crisis politically were assisted by Chinese overreach. China\u2019s propaganda machine fiercely denounced Australia, and almost all official contacts were frozen. In November 2020 China\u2019s embassy in Australia made public a list of 14 grievances with the country\u2019s then conservative government. Ranging far beyond economic questions, China moaned that members of Australia\u2019s parliament were allowed to criticise the Communist Party and that the country\u2019s news outlets published \u201cunfriendly or antagonistic\u201d reporting on China. The then-prime minister, Scott Morrison, suggested that these complaints were essentially against \u201cAustralia just being Australia\u201d.\nEncouraged by such missteps, Australia held its nerve. The election of a new government, led by Anthony Albanese, then gave China an excuse to climb down.\nMr Albanese\u2019s government has been careful not to crow. Dispelling talk of a big win for the West, it claims to be steadfastly respectful and pragmatic in its dealing with China. The idea, ministers say, is to \u201cco-operate where we can, disagree where we must\u201d\u2014meaning no gratuitous poking of the dragon. \u201cDisagree behind closed doors, but don\u2019t amplify your differences,\u201d warns another Australian official. \u201cChina responds well to this.\u201d\nAlongside such caution, Australia also understood its strengths. China relented because it \u201csaw that we wouldn\u2019t capitulate\u201d, the same official argues. Australia resisted demands to change laws, overturn investment bans and muffle critics. Rather, under its previous and current government, it tied its security policy tighter to America through AUKUS, a trilateral submarine-building pact that also includes Britain, and a policy of deterrence. It is also doing more diplomatically to counter China\u2019s influence in the Pacific. The trade bans have in this sense backfired.\nAustralia set another useful example at the wto. China agreed to review its barley tariffs just as Australia\u2019s case against them was concluding. Rather than force the issue to a judgment, Australia suspended its action. \u201cChina does not want to be shamed in the international arena,\u201d says Matthew Goodman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nAustralia was additionally helped by the fact that China wants to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a vast regional trade deal. As a CPTPP member, Australia could block China\u2019s accession. It accordingly made clear there was no possibility of accession talks so long as China was trampling economic rules and its pre-existing free-trade agreements with Australia. \nHow will Australia guard against the risk of a repeat? Decoupling is not on the agenda\u2014China still accounts for almost a third of its total goods and services exports. But three years of Chinese bullying have left a mark. Australia is trying to reduce its reliance on China by signing free-trade agreements with India and Britain. Another, with the EU, is in the works.\nChina\u2019s aggression has concentrated minds among Australia\u2019s partners and allies, too. At meetings in Japan on May 20th, leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries voiced concern at the \u201cdisturbing rise in incidents of economic coercion\u201d and promised, for the first time, to collaborate against attempts to \u201cweaponise economic dependencies\u201d. There is more talk of solidarity and co-ordination, so countries do not profit by selling more to a bully when a friend or neighbour is being targeted. America\u2019s ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, talks of his country offering \u201csupport and countervailing opportunities to partners in their times of need\u201d.\nChina is the largest trade partner of a long and growing list of countries. Very few have the wealth and natural resources that protected Australia, the \u201clucky\u201d country. Even so, many are studying the lessons of Australia\u2019s escape from China\u2019s grip. \u25a0", "description": "The \u201clucky country\u201d may be uniquely able to endure Chinese bullying",
