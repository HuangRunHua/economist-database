For nearly three-quarters of a century the dollar has at a global scale dominated trade, finance and the rainy-day reserve portfolios of central banks. Yet high inflation, fractious geopolitics and the sanctions imposed by America and its allies on countries such as Russia have lately caused dollar-doubters to become vocal once again.\nOften these episodes are fuelled by a world leader\u2019s spasm of anger towards the dollar. In 1965 Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, then France\u2019s finance minister, raged against the \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d the greenback conferred on America. This time it was Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s president, who on a recent visit to China called for emerging markets to trade using their own currencies. At the same time, a surging gold price and a fall in the dollar\u2019s share of global reserves has roused other doubters, who can also point to this month\u2019s admission by Janet Yellen, America\u2019s treasury secretary, that over time using sanctions \u201ccould undermine the hegemony\u201d of the currency. It does not help that America could soon face a fiscal crisis if Congress fails to raise the ceiling that limits how much the government can borrow.\nYet the doubters\u2019 excitement has become detached from reality. The greenback exerts an almighty gravitational pull on the world economy that has not materially weakened\u2014even if America has recently found that there are real obstacles to exploiting its currency\u2019s pre-eminence. \nThe starting advantage of the dollar is immense. Between a third and a half of global trade is invoiced in dollars, a share that has been relatively stable over the long term. It is involved in nearly 90% of foreign-exchange transactions; such is the liquidity of the greenback that if you want to swap euros for Swiss francs, it can be cheaper to trade via dollars than to do so directly. About half of cross-border debt is dollar-denominated. And although the dollar\u2019s share of central-bank reserves has fallen over the long term, it still accounts for about 60% of them. There is no sign of a dramatic recent change, save that which has been caused mechanically by central banks revaluing their portfolios to take account of exchange-rate movements and higher interest rates in America.\nNo other currency is close to matching this ecosystem\u2019s size, or its fundamental appeal: the supply of safe assets available to dollar investors. The euro zone is fragile and its sovereign-debt market is mostly fragmented between its member states. China cannot possibly satisfy global demand for safe assets so long as it both tightly controls flows of capital and runs current-account surpluses (meaning it is, on net, accumulating financial claims on the rest of the world rather than vice versa). And the dollar, as the dominant currency, benefits from network effects. People want to use the currency everyone else is using.\nWhat is increasingly clear, though, is that individual countries can circumvent the dominant system if they really want to. Though Russia\u2019s war economy has been wounded by sanctions, it has not been crippled, in part because 16% of its exports are now paid for in yuan, up from almost none before it invaded Ukraine.\nChina\u2019s alternative to the SWIFT interbank-messaging system has been growing rapidly. It has also been switching more of its bilateral trade towards settlement in renminbi\u2014an easier task than replacing the dollar in trade flows between other countries. Even many firms in the West now use renminbi for trade with China. New digital-payments technologies and central-bank digital currencies could yet make it easier to move money around the world without involving America.\nBalance of power\nMoreover, Ms Yellen is right that using the dollar to push countries around is no way to make or keep friends. America has not placed secondary sanctions on countries like India which still trade with Russia, because it fears the backlash that would result. Although a shift to a multipolar system of currencies is not imminent, it could occur later this century as America\u2019s share of the world economy shrinks. Such a system would be inherently less stable than one centred on the dollar\u2014so it would be in the interests of neither America nor the world to hasten the shift. \u25a0", "description": "The greenback is still king.
