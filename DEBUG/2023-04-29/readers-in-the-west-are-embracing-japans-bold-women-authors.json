She first conjured them up as a child, while enduring bullying at school and hectoring at home. Her parents forced her to practise cooking and encouraged \u201cgirlie\u201d behaviour, thinking that would one day help attract a rich husband. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like my body, my life, belonged to me,\u201d Ms Murata (pictured) says. She dreamed of flying away, on a spaceship with her fantastical companions, to a planet where she would belong.\nThroughout her fiction, Ms Murata questions what it means to be \u201cnormal\u201d and writes sceptically about family life. Her work has struck a chord in Japan, her conservative home country. Her semi-autobiographical novel, \u201cConvenience Store Woman\u201d, won the prestigious Akutagawa literary prize in 2016. It has since been translated into more than 30 languages and sold over 1.5m copies. \nMs Murata\u2019s work has helped usher in a new era of Japanese literature in translation. \u201cConvenience Store Woman\u201d came out in English in 2018 and its feminist undertones may have resonated amid the #MeToo movement, thinks Ginny Tapley Takemori, its translator. In 2020 \u201cBreasts and Eggs\u201d, a novel about pregnancy and beauty standards by Kawakami Mieko, another female Japanese author, also became an international bestseller. \u201cPublishers used to ask for the next Haruki Murakami,\u201d says David Boyd, a translator who has worked on Ms Kawakami\u2019s books. \u201cNow they ask: What\u2019s going to be the next \u2018Convenience Store Woman\u2019?\u201d \nThough the settings may be unfamiliar to Western readers, these books examine universal themes, such as the challenges of family life. In \u201cWeasels in the Attic\u201d (2022), a novella made up of interlinking stories, Oyamada Hiroko portrays an unhappily married couple who seek fulfilment by having a baby. \u201cIn Japan, it seems as if women are seen as incomplete unless they have a child,\u201d says Ms Oyamada. Her short story \u201cSpider Lilies\u201d explores the related obsession with breastfeeding. \u201cWhen I had a baby, I felt like my breasts were a public asset,\u201d the author says. \u201cStrangers kept asking me: \u2018Is the milk coming?\u2019\u201d\nMs Murata\u2019s view of motherhood is even more caustic. The women in her fiction are often \u201cmonstrous\u201d. In \u201cNothingness\u201d, a short story, the female protagonist is incapable of maternal affection. Ms Murata once hoped her own mother would shower her with unconditional love. She now says the mother-daughter relationship usually involves \u201cbeautified abuse\u201d.\nToday\u2019s literary stars belong to a long lineage of feminist writing in Japan. In the 1970s, amid anti-war and anti-capitalist feminist movements, the child-killing mother became a popular trope in fiction by Japanese women, says Iida Yuko of Nagoya University. Novelists including Oba Minako and Kono Taeko used disturbing imagery to rebel against a view of women as baby-making machines. Bookish types hope the new overseas interest in Japanese writers will extend to this period, too.\nYet the likes of Ms Murata are breaking new ground in their bold depictions of sexuality. \u201cGrowing up and dating men, I never thought women could be sexual agents,\u201d she says, noting that Japanese popular culture idealises subservient women. Her characters are aroused by things such as stuffed toys and curtains: whereas heterosexual love often turns into a \u201cmanual\u201d, intimacy with objects is more \u201ccreative\u201d, she writes in \u201cVanishing World\u201d, a sci-fi tale of a world where people breed through artificial insemination. \u201cThere\u2019s always a hierarchy between man and woman,\u201d echoes Ms Oyamada. In \u201cLost in the Zoo\u201d, a short story, she likens unhappy families to caged animals, trapped by convention. A lesbian couple, by contrast, exude an air of liberty. \nThese books may be by and about women, but a man\u2019s perspective can be useful, Ms Oyamada suggests. \u201cWhen I depict men\u2019s behaviour through the eyes of a woman, many people see it as an attack,\u201d she says. \u201cI can avoid that by speaking as a man.\u201d She stages chauvinistic discussions between male characters in \u201cWeasels in the Attic\u201d, demonstrating their obliviousness to the demands of child-rearing. \u201cMost men aren\u2019t even aware of the pain they inflict on women,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s good that such pain is becoming more visible.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only
