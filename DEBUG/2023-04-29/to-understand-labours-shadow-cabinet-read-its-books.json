They tackle such uncomfortable topics as sexism, racism and Peterborough. Their authors travel to places like Wigan and Halifax, and feel sad in them. In reviews these books have been garlanded with such adjectives as \u201cmuch-needed\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d. Almost all of them, in other words, are heroically boring. \nConsider, for example, one single sentence from the book \u201cAll In\u201d by Lisa Nandy, the shadow secretary of state for levelling up. It is: \u201cThanks to the foresight of local leaders and the regional development agency of well over a decade ago, companies from all over the world have been persuaded to invest in Grimsby because of its great natural asset\u2014wind.\u201d If you enjoyed that, good news: there are 198 more pages where it came from.\nThere are few better ways to get to know a political party than to read the books its MPs produce. Conservative cabinet ministers, for example, tend to specialise in honeyed histories of the proud past. Boris Johnson wrote a well-reviewed biography of Churchill (\u201cthis book sizzles\u201d); William Hague, a former Tory leader, wrote a much-lauded biography of William Pitt the Younger (\u201cfirst-class\u201d); and Nadine Dorries, a one-time cabinet minister, wrote a series of historical nursing romances starting with \u201cThe Angels of Lovely Lane\u201d (\u201cheart-warming\u201d). Such books tell you a little about the past\u2014and a lot about the Tories.\nThe library offered by Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet is similarly revealing. For one thing, these books tend to focus more on the problematic present than the past. For another, all are notably low on lovely angels. Labour\u2019s library offers such titles as \u201cGo Big: How to Fix Our World\u201d by Ed Miliband, who holds the climate-change brief; \u201cTribes: A Search for Belonging in a Divided Society\u201d by David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary; and \u201cEuropean Human Rights Law: The Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights\u201d by Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader. None has been called \u201csizzling\u201d. \nThat is not necessarily a bad thing. Many might feel relieved at the prospect of a prime minister who writes the sort of book that offers \u201cdetailed analysis of the Human Rights Act 1998\u201d. Moreover, some of these books are good. Mr Lammy\u2019s has moments of fine writing; Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the exchequer, has produced an intelligent and thoughtful history of women in Westminster.\nBut overall these books are not what you would call rollicking. In 1943 George Orwell wrote an essay titled: \u201cCan Socialists be Happy?\u201d No one doubts that Tories can be happy, or have fun. Open a book by or about Tories and you might find Alan Clark having fun with Thatcher\u2019s ankles (\u201cattractive\u2026in the 1940 style\u201d); or David Cameron having fun with the perfume of the diarist, Sasha Swire (\u201cIt makes me want to grab you and push you into the bushes and give you one!\u201d); or Boris Johnson having fun with more or less everyone.\nLabour\u2019s books are less jolly. This is unsurprising. They have been out of office for 13 years. The Tories get to write about the corridors of power, whereas Labour politicians must wring their hands about the state of Britain. It is harder to write a fun book about that. At times, you get the feeling that they are hardly even trying. Ms Nandy, for example, bombards her readers with facts (\u201cHalf of all the world\u2019s polysilicon\u2026comes from the Xinjiang province of China.\u201d). It is like reading an aggrieved version of Wikipedia.\nAnd almost all of these books are filled with clich\u00e9s. Their authors are always finding people \u201cbrave\u201d and \u201cinspiring\u201d and fretting about such things as how women\u2019s voices have been \u201csilenced\u201d. Such phrases feel like they have been assembled from a stock of Fabian Society fridge poetry. They are not bad things to write; but they are not interesting either. Orwell wondered in his essay whether socialists can be happy. The question that comes to mind when reading these books is: \u201cCan Their Readers Be?\u201d \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly
