She is already back, as the 13th director-general of Britain\u2019s most prominent business lobby group. And possibly its last. Engulfed by allegations of the worst kind of workplace misconduct and shunned by politicians and its own members, the CBI looks done for.\nMs Newton-Smith\u2019s return was prompted by the dismissal on April 11th of Tony Danker, who had run the CBI since November 2020, for \u201cconduct [that] fell short of that expected of the director-general\u201d. Though sorry for making some staff feel \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d, Mr Danker later told the BBC his sacking was unfair. The grounds he was given, he said, included viewing employees\u2019 Instagram accounts, sending non-work messages on work platforms, inviting junior staff to one-on-one meetings and organising a private karaoke party. The CBI did not go into specifics.\nThe rot anyway went much further. Far graver complaints, not involving Mr Danker, had already come to light. The Guardian had reported allegations by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct and the misuse of drugs. This included a rape and an attempted assault at a party on a boat in 2019. The Guardian has since reported that another woman alleges she was raped by two male colleagues. Police are investigating potential offences.\nThe CBI\u2019s reputation has gone from worthy-but-dull to downright poisonous. Ministers and officials have dropped contact; so have many of the CBI\u2019s 190,000 members. Some have quit altogether, including the John Lewis Partnership and Kingfisher, two retailers; Aviva, an insurer, and the Association of British Insurers (ABI), a trade body; and NatWest, a bank. \nIn a contrite letter on April 24th the CBI\u2019s president, Brian McBride, a former head of Amazon\u2019s British arm, told members of his board\u2019s \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cbewilderment\u201d. It had believed the CBI\u2019s corporate culture \u201cwas among the very best\u201d\u2014yet \u201cwe failed to filter out culturally toxic people\u201d when hiring them, and \u201cvictims of harassment or violence\u201d felt \u201ctheir only option\u201d was to go to the Guardian. Mr McBride now promises \u201czero tolerance\u201d of sexual harassment and bullying, top-to-bottom training, improved recruitment procedures and a whistle-blowing channel outside the organisation. \nAll this is to regain members\u2019 lost trust before the CBI presents a reformed version of itself to (remaining) members at an extraordinary general meeting in June. \u201cWhether that is possible\u201d, wrote Mr McBride, \u201cI simply don\u2019t know.\u201d\nIf the CBI is beyond saving, does it matter? Firms also belong to sectoral bodies like the ABI, and the biggest have their own government contacts. But the CBI provides a single voice on common concerns, such as skills or corporate tax. It claims the \u201cfurlough\u201d wage-subsidy scheme during the pandemic and recent expansion of state help with child care among its wins. It also boasts the \u201clargest policy unit outside Whitehall\u201d, with over 100 economists.\nStill, four other broad bodies\u2014the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors and Make UK, which represents manufacturers\u2014have also met ministers regularly, alongside the CBI. None duplicates the CBI, but the BCC is closest. Nick Frith of WPI Strategy, a public-relations firm, has pitched a temporary channel, called BizUK, to represent business\u2019s views in the run-up to the next election. \nCompanies will find politicians eager to listen\u2014a change from the years of mutual suspicion over Brexit and Corbynism. On April 24th Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, tried to charm corporate bigwigs at a government-sponsored conference. Sir Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s leader, is due to address the BCC\u2019s annual shindig in mid-May. Rejected by both the lobbied and the lobbied-for, the CBI is deservedly shut out. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only
