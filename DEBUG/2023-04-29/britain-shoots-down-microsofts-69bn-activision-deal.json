On April 26th Britain\u2019s antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (cma), blocked Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a publisher of games such as \u201cCall of Duty\u201d, arguing that the combined firm could gain too much clout and reduce choice for consumers. The surprise decision may have killed the deal worldwide.\nThe $69bn acquisition, which would have been Microsoft\u2019s largest and one of tech\u2019s biggest ever, had seemed on track. The European Commission was expected to give it the nod next month. America\u2019s Federal Trade Commission (ftc) had objected, but faced a difficult battle in court to stop it. Britain had long been seen as the hardest of the big three regulators to convince. But when in March the cma dismissed concerns from Sony about Microsoft\u2019s advantage in the console market, and after Microsoft signed ten-year deals to make Activision games available on other platforms, it looked like game on.\nInstead it seems to be game over. The cma ruled that in cloud gaming, an emerging technology in which games are streamed Netflix-style, Microsoft plus Activision might become excessively dominant. Microsoft is already the biggest player in cloud gaming, with some two-thirds of the worldwide business. Control of Activision\u2019s catalogue of hits might make it unassailable, the cma said, adding that it doubted the effectiveness of ten-year deals in a new and fast-changing market.\nThe cloud-gaming market is indeed new and fast-changing, which makes it an odd place to wield the regulatory sledgehammer. Cloud-streaming subscriptions accounted for less than 1% of games spending last year, and it is far from certain that the technology will take off. Google shut down its Stadia cloud service in January and Amazon\u2019s similar Luna platform is unpopular. Even if Microsoft bucked the trend, it would be good for consumers. Cloud gaming is \u201ca vector of competition\u201d between Microsoft and rivals like Sony and Nintendo, \u201cnot a distinct market\u201d, wrote Clay Griffin of MoffettNathanson, a firm of analysts, who accused the cma of applying \u201cfaulty logic\u201d. Weakening the main cloud-gaming service will entrench the console industry\u2014and its leader, Sony.\nMicrosoft and Activision will appeal. Yet Britain\u2019s appeals tribunal focuses narrowly on process and tends to defer to the cma. Microsoft\u2019s only other options are to break off a smaller chunk of Activision or carve Britain out of the global deal, both things it has previously indicated it will not do. Without a deal Microsoft\u2019s future in gaming is in question, says Ben Thompson of the Stratechery newsletter. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the [gaming] division makes sense if Microsoft has the current business model dictated to them, given just how dominant Sony is with said business model.\u201d\nMicrosoft is not the only big tech firm to have been ambushed by the cma, which last year forced Facebook to undo its acquisition of Giphy, an unassuming generator of internet memes. Another Silicon Valley giant says that, since Brexit, Britain has been the feistiest of the big global regulators. America\u2019s ftc is aggressive but reined in by the courts. The European Commission offers more scope for dialogue, tech lawyers report. The cma, meanwhile, is getting stronger. On April 25th Britain published a bill giving it wide discretion to regulate the biggest tech firms, with the power to dish out fines of up to 10% of global turnover. A separate online-safety bill proposes more rules for tech companies, including restrictions on encryption.\nYet Britain\u2019s new global clout may backfire. WhatsApp and others have threatened to leave the country rather than apply its encryption rules worldwide.  Activision, whose share price fell by a tenth on the ruling, says it will reassess British plans, adding: \u201cGlobal innovators large and small will take note that\u2014despite all its rhetoric\u2014the uk is clearly closed for business.\u201d\u25a0\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",
