A week later, as tens of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv and other cities, the demonstrations shifted to the centre ground. Gone were the Palestinian banners. In their place was a sea of blue-and-white Israeli flags. \nIn the months that followed the protesters displayed other symbols of Israeli nationhood, such as massive reproductions of Israel\u2019s Declaration of Independence, with its promises of \u201cfreedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel\u201d. To broaden this new movement\u2019s appeal, its organisers made a conscious decision to focus it on a battle over the nature of democracy in the Jewish state. Without explicitly saying so, they framed their cause as a struggle over the very meaning of Zionism and who its rightful torchbearers are\u2014the secular and liberal Israelis making up much of the protest movement, or the religious, conservative supporters of Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. \nIt is a continuation of a dispute as old as Zionism itself, yet every bit as relevant to Israel\u2019s future as it was 120 years ago. Theodor Herzl (pictured), the man venerated in Israel for sparking a movement to give Jews their own state, nearly tore it apart in 1903 when he proposed that the Jews seek a haven from rising anti-Semitism, in east Africa. His proposal for \u201ca modern solution to the Jewish Question\u201d highlighted the tension at the heart of Zionism. Was it simply a plan to establish a national home for persecuted Jews, wherever that might be, or an ideology for the creation of a particularly Jewish state in its biblical homeland?\nToday\u2019s tensions over Israeli democracy would have been familiar to many of Herzl\u2019s followers. Some were secular, even assimilated Jews, whose imaginations were fired by the birth of nationalism across Europe. For those who were born into religious families, however, Zionism encapsulated the thrice-daily traditional Jewish prayer: \u201cMay our eyes behold Your return to Zion.\u201d \nAs Herzl\u2019s Zionist movement grew in the years leading up to Israel\u2019s founding in 1948, it was dominated by secular Jews who divided into two main camps. Their imprint is still felt on Israeli politics today. One camp was led by Ze\u2019ev Jabotinsky, a right-winger who drew heavily on European nationalism, and in some cases fascism. He argued for \u201cone flag\u201d, meaning a single-minded focus on establishing a Jewish state. He believed this should encompass not just Palestine but also modern-day Jordan. Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party is the ideological heir of this \u201cRevisionist Zionism\u201d camp.\nSet against this was the socialist camp of David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s first prime minister. The socialists gained control of the Zionist movement in the late 1920s and went on to establish a state built on collectivist agriculture and government-owned industries. They dominated Israeli politics from 1948 to 1977 even as they quietly ditched their left-wing economics. \u201cZionism was basically split between those who saw it as an instrument not only for Jewish statehood, but for a bigger reality, like socialism, and the Jabotinskean \u2018one flag\u2019 ideal,\u201d says Micah Goodman, an Israeli philosopher. The socialists won, he argues, but Jabotinsky\u2019s vision endured.\nA movement whose primary animating force was the yearning for a state might have been expected to die away once it had achieved its goal. But it has been challenged by the growth of religious Zionism, a once-insignificant part of the broader Zionist movement that is now a powerful force in Mr Netanyahu\u2019s government. Since the six-day war in 1967 when Israel captured the territories of the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, religious Zionists have been at the vanguard of the settler movement, which still dreams of a \u201cGreater Israel\u201d than that contained in its pre-1967 borders. \nThe presence of hundreds of thousands of settlers in these occupied territories is a daunting obstacle to the creation of a viable Palestinian state. But religious Zionism has even bigger plans for Israeli society. Its current leader, Bezalel Smotrich, Mr Netanyahu\u2019s finance minister, speaks of his desire to restore Jewish biblical law. Messianic Zionism is still a minority view, but it is gaining ground and influencing Likud, a party that was previously largely secular. \nCreating their own vision\nYet the protest movement that has come out to oppose Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition has seen an opportunity to push back at its vision of the Jewish state. \u201cThe new struggle for Israeli democracy has highlighted that we\u2019re still fighting for a Zionism [that\u2026] means all these things: democracy, ending the occupation of the Palestinians and achieving a more equal society,\u201d says Rami Hod, the director of the Berl Katznelson Centre, a progressive Zionist think-tank in Tel Aviv. \u201cWe can only achieve that in Israel through Zionism.\u201d The question Israelis must answer though, as in the 1920s, is which Zionism will prevail. \u25a0", "description": "It has been co-opted by politicians on all sides", "ogDescription": "It has been co-opted by politicians on all sides", "imageUrl":
