She was on her way to film footage of teenagers in a village in Donbas, on the front line of the conflict that had rumbled there since 2014. She soon realised that her mission was impossible. \n\u201cWhat can you do with your camera,\u201d Ms Kovalenko asks, \u201cwhen there are bombs falling on your head?\u201d She helped several of the figures in the documentary she was making, \u201cWe Will Not Fade Away\u201d (see picture), reach safety; it had its premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival this February. Then she said goodbye to her French husband and young son and joined a volunteer unit, fighting first near the capital, then, last April and May, near Kharkiv, when Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces back towards the border. \nMs Kovalenko is part of a new generation of Ukrainian film-makers who came of age during the Maidan revolution of 2013-14 and have increasingly won audiences and prizes abroad. Documentarians developed a personal and domestic style. For instance, \u201cThe Earth Is Blue as an Orange\u201d, which won many awards in 2020-21, depicted a family in a war zone filming a documentary about themselves. Feature films blossomed, too. Set in a boarding school for deaf teenagers, \u201cThe Tribe\u201d won several prizes at Cannes in 2014. \u201cFalling\u201d (2017) was a sparse, dislocated love story exploring themes of violence, corruption and identity. \u201cAtlantis\u201d (2019) was a dystopian fantasy set in a post-war Donbas.\nAs Daria Badior, a critic and co-curator of a film festival in Kyiv, puts it, the first response of Ukrainian film-makers to political upheaval was \u201cto make something that reflected their lives\u201d. Beneath these intimate stories, the conflict in Donbas shuddered through Ukrainian films of the past decade. Yet for many film-makers, as for Ms Kovalenko, last year\u2019s all-out Russian onslaught seemed to render their craft almost irrelevant. \n\u201cI had a very strong feeling that cinema didn\u2019t matter any more,\u201d says Marina Stepanska, director of \u201cFalling\u201d. \u201cI considered quitting.\u201d In the weeks after the invasion, film-making ceased. Government funding dried up. \u201cMany film-makers went into the army,\u201d says Ms Badior, \u201calong with actors, screenwriters, cinematographers and sound engineers.\u201d Some were wounded; others, such as Viktor Onysko, a friend of hers and a talented editor, have perished. \nAfter the initial shock, directors turned to documentaries to capture the reality of war. Ms Stepanska is making one that follows several people in the film community who have joined the war effort, observers turned participants. She hopes to avoid clich\u00e9d images of conflict and instead \u201cto build a story of daily experiences\u201d: the boredom and solitude of a foxhole; soldiers\u2019 recurring conversations about fear and death. \u201cThese ordinary things interest me more than ruins and action.\u201d\nFor her part, Ms Kovalenko found herself filming a kind of video diary at the front: \u201cI wanted to save some memories for my son, in case I died.\u201d She filmed simple things, \u201ctrees and grass and the trenches, routine life.\u201d War, she says, is \u201cnot only about action and bombing; it is also about waiting and looking at the same lines of horizons for hours and hours.\u201d Ms Stepanska persuaded her to turn this footage into another film. Having left her unit, Ms Kovalenko plans to overlay a narration drawing on letters she wrote to her son to read when he was older. The text is \u201cexperimental and poetic\u201d, she says. \u201cOn the front line you\u2019re in an extreme situation, and you have lots of reflections about your life.\u201d \nAs for feature films, the obstacles are now ethical rather than creative or practical. Foreign cultural institutions and production firms have set up funds to support Ukrainian film-makers. Directors are already scouting for re-enactments of the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha last year. For many others, though, it is too soon to turn the ghastly facts of the war into fiction. \u201cI think we need more time,\u201d says Ms Kovalenko.\nCamera, action\n\u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s a dilemma,\u201d says Denis Ivanov, a prominent producer. \u201cYou can\u2019t be silent about what has happened,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it seems right to make these films now.\u201d They risk coming across as \u201cwar porn\u201d. He is developing a script for a feature film about the siege of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, in collaboration with Oleh Sentsov\u2014a well-known director from Crimea who spent more than five years in prison in Russia and is now serving on the front line. But they have decided not to discuss it publicly, and won\u2019t release it before the war ends. \n\u201cRhino\u201d, Ms Sentsov\u2019s movie about the rise of a Ukrainian gangster in the 1990s, was released in February 2022. \u201cWe joke that the Russian invasion killed our second box-office weekend,\u201d says Mr Ivanov, who produced it. Now, despite the ongoing bombardment, Ukrainian cinemas are open. \u201cAvatar 2\u201d has been popular, as have Ukrainian films made shortly before the war, among them \u201cKlondike\u201d, a family drama set against the shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, and \u201cMavka. The Forest Song\u201d, an animated fairy-tale. Almost all Ukraine\u2019s regular film festivals are persevering, notes Ms Badior, if with some relocations and delays. An impresario even put on a festival of old Ukrainian war films in a bomb shelter in Mykolaiv.\nKyiv Critics\u2019 Week, the festival that Ms Badior runs, opened in October, just as Russia launched strikes against Ukraine\u2019s electrical infrastructure. Her team bought extra generators; screenings were packed. \u201cIt was very reassuring,\u201d she says, \u201cthat after all the tragedy and the heartbreak, the deaths and the funerals, you can still come to the cinema and watch a film, like it or dislike it, discuss it afterwards\u2026It was a beautiful thing.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies,
