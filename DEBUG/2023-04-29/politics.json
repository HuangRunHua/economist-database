A strategic review pointed to competition between America and China in the Indo-Pacific as \u201cthe defining feature of our region and our time\u201d, which had \u201cthe potential to threaten our interests\u201d. Improved long-range missile technology means Australia can no longer rely on its remoteness to avoid attack. The government said the first guided missiles to be made in Australia would start production in 2025, earlier than expected.   \nSingapore executed a man for arranging to smuggle 1kg of cannabis into the country in 2013. Human-rights groups and his family claim the man\u2019s conviction was unsafe. The authorities insist that he received a fair trial. \nVolodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, held an hour-long phone call with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, the first direct talks between the two since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. This came after China\u2019s ambassador to France caused a diplomatic spat by saying that former Soviet states, including Ukraine, \u201cdo not have an effective status in international law\u201d. China\u2019s foreign ministry disowned the ambassador\u2019s remarks.\nNine European countries, including Britain, signed an agreement to boost offshore wind power in the North Sea. On the day the deal was signed Norway\u2019s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Store, warned that Russia was increasing its maritime intelligence surveillance in the area, which he described as a threat. \nAggressive, or assertive?\nDominic Raab resigned as Britain\u2019s deputy prime minister after an independent inquiry found some of his behaviour towards staff as foreign secretary and justice secretary counted as bullying. Mr Raab noted that all but two complaints had been dismissed, and said he had been targeted by \u201cactivist civil servants\u201d. His defenders said the inquiry set a low bar for bullying and would make effective government more difficult. \nGustavo Petro, Colombia\u2019s left-wing president, asked his cabinet to resign after it became clear that he had lost his majority in Congress. Mr Petro spooked markets by ditching Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo as finance minister. He is a moderate and was seen as a stabilising force in the country\u2019s first leftist government. The new finance minister is Ricardo Bonilla, who is an ally of Mr Petro and seen as less independent than Mr Ocampo. \nIn Chile Gabriel Boric, the left-wing president, launched a plan to create a state-run lithium company. Chile is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of the metal. A bill to formalise the creation of the nationalised company will be presented this year.\nIn Sudan fighting continued between two rival generals, despite efforts to broker a ceasefire. Several countries including America, Britain, France and Germany have evacuated their nationals. Thousands of residents of Khartoum, the capital, have fled to the countryside or neighbouring countries.\n\nMen wearing uniforms of the Burkina Faso army surrounded a village and killed 150 unarmed people in the latest of a series of atrocities against civilians. The killings came after a jihadist attack on a  nearby army position.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s government got itself into a twist over the country\u2019s membership of the International Criminal Court. The court has issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin, putting pressure on South Africa to arrest him if he attends a summit in August. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president, said he would withdraw from the ICC. His office said he had spoken in error. \n\nIsrael celebrated the 75th anniversary of its founding. In a speech Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, highlighted Israel\u2019s achievements since its birth and called for unity. Meanwhile more big protests were planned against his government\u2019s push to reform the judiciary. The government has put the reforms on hold but is expected to reintroduce them when the Knesset comes back into session on April 30th.", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print":

Some Democrats had questioned whether he would run again, given that, if he wins, he will be 82 at his re-inauguration. Mr Biden said America was still in a battle for its \u201csoul\u201d with Republican \u201cextremists\u201d; his announcement video replayed the violent attack on Congress by Donald Trump\u2019s supporters in January 2021. If Mr Trump can stay out of jail before the election he seems on course to be the Republican candidate. Polling shows that most voters want neither man to run again. \nThe Supreme Court decided that mifepristone could continue to be sold while it faces legal challenges in lower courts. That overturned a ruling by a judge in Texas to stop the sale of the abortion pill in a case focused on its approval in 2000 by the Food and Drug Administration. Mr Biden will make abortion an issue at the election. \nAll Tuckered out\nTucker Carlson, America\u2019s best-known right-wing pundit, was abruptly sacked by Fox News. It was unclear exactly why Mr Carlson, for years a thorn in the side of liberals, was defenestrated. There was speculation that Fox News considered him to be a liability, soon after it paid $787.5m to Dominion Voting Systems for broadcasting fake claims about its election machines. \nThe House of Representatives passed legislation that increases the cap on the federal debt, but also calls for deep spending cuts. The bill was supported by Republicans, but rejected by Democrats, who don\u2019t want any conditions attached to raising the debt ceiling. The government has already hit that ceiling and is using \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to pay its bills. \nDisney filed a lawsuit against Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, claiming he was behind \u201ca targeted campaign of government retaliation\u201d against the company when it came out against the state\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill. Disney was stripped of its special self-governing status amid the row over the bill, a decision it says threatens its business. \nElon Musk said he was hopeful that another launch of his Space X Starship could happen within a few months. Space X ordered the 120-metre rocket-spacecraft combination to destruct four minutes after its debut launch in Texas when it encountered problems. \nAn Islamic State terrorist who planned the bombing of Kabul airport in August 2021, killing more than 170 people, including 13 American troops, has been killed by the Taliban, according to America\u2019s National Security Council. IS renewed its campaign of violence in Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power in 2021, launching attacks on civilians and Taliban fighters. The Taliban has responded by killing key IS commanders. \nYoon Suk-yeol visited Washington for the first state visit to America by a South Korean president in a decade. Joe Biden renewed his country\u2019s commitment to protect South Korea from North Korean aggression, announcing the deployment of more nuclear-capable aircraft to the country and promising more consultation on nuclear strategy. South Korea pledged not to develop its own nuclear weapons. \nAustralia\u2019s Labor government announced the biggest shake-up to the country\u2019s defence priorities in decades. A strategic review pointed to competition between America and China in the Indo-Pacific as \u201cthe defining feature of our region and our time\u201d, which had \u201cthe potential to threaten our interests\u201d. Improved long-range missile technology means Australia can no longer rely on its remoteness to avoid attack. The government said the first guided missiles to be made in Australia would start production in 2025, earlier than expected.   \nSingapore executed a man for arranging to smuggle 1kg of cannabis into the country in 2013. Human-rights groups and his family claim the man\u2019s conviction was unsafe. The authorities insist that he received a fair trial. \nVolodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, held an hour-long phone call with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, the first direct talks between the two since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. This came after China\u2019s ambassador to France caused a diplomatic spat by saying that former Soviet states, including Ukraine, \u201cdo not have an effective status in international law\u201d. China\u2019s foreign ministry disowned the ambassador\u2019s remarks.\nNine European countries, including Britain, signed an agreement to boost offshore wind power in the North Sea. On the day the deal was signed Norway\u2019s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Store, warned that Russia was increasing its maritime intelligence surveillance in the area, which he described as a threat. \nAggressive, or assertive?\nDominic Raab resigned as Britain\u2019s deputy prime minister after an independent inquiry found some of his behaviour towards staff as foreign secretary and justice secretary counted as bullying. Mr Raab noted that all but two complaints had been dismissed, and said he had been targeted by \u201cactivist civil servants\u201d. His defenders said the inquiry set a low bar for bullying and would make effective government more difficult. \nGustavo Petro, Colombia\u2019s left-wing president, asked his cabinet to resign after it became clear that he had lost his majority in Congress. Mr Petro spooked markets by ditching Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo as finance minister. He is a moderate and was seen as a stabilising force in the country\u2019s first leftist government. The new finance minister is Ricardo Bonilla, who is an ally of Mr Petro and seen as less independent than Mr Ocampo. \nIn Chile Gabriel Boric, the left-wing president, launched a plan to create a state-run lithium company. Chile is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of the metal. A bill to formalise the creation of the nationalised company will be presented this year.\nIn Sudan fighting continued between two rival generals, despite efforts to broker a ceasefire. Several countries including America, Britain, France and Germany have evacuated their nationals. Thousands of residents of Khartoum, the capital, have fled to the countryside or neighbouring countries.\n\nMen wearing uniforms of the Burkina Faso army surrounded a village and killed 150 unarmed people in the latest of a series of atrocities against civilians. The killings came after a jihadist attack on a  nearby army position.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s government got itself into a twist over the country\u2019s membership of the International Criminal Court. The court has issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin, putting pressure on South Africa to arrest him if he attends a summit in August. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president, said he would withdraw from the ICC. His office said he had spoken in error. \n\nIsrael celebrated the 75th anniversary of its founding. In a speech Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, highlighted Israel\u2019s achievements since its birth and called for unity. Meanwhile more big protests were planned against his government\u2019s push to reform the judiciary. The government has put the reforms on hold but is expected to reintroduce them when the Knesset comes back into session on April 30th.", "description": "", "ogDescription": "", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230429_WWP003.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-04-27T13:02:16Z", "dateModified": "2023-04-27T14:11:54Z", "dateCreated": "2023-04-26T11:51:36Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-04-29T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/m77k1ouisc2hhdfmppoo446d4j2a4g28", "publication": [{"id": "/content/7muvl5mgi1q35gdgs3k98ik2rq4ei6ne", "context": {"position": 100.01, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/60jbbpq8pd0p2qcii3j31hspv4g4vnvq", "context": {"position": 100.01, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3p8bl98bt4uuijd9p1v55t2nk5id4hfj", "context": {"position": 100.01, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/jb72tlgel2347aqfb5insslbuodu1shj", "context": {"position": 100.01, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/v5dd0o92du3hf9tjeikph0v7nmeud9i1", "context": {"position": 100.01, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/i8k8gndk2fv2mfo9mbuf0jinsamikvuc", "context": {"position": 100.01, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/i6ieuh35lmoduebs0v9e6ioa7vsedc3o", "context": {"position": 100.01, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Politics", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2023/04/27/politics", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/84gh45hrgiqm06odvhgt8nmbv5ilrci5", "publication": [{"id": "/content/7muvl5mgi1q35gdgs3k98ik2rq4ei6ne", "context": {"position": 100.02, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/60jbbpq8pd0p2qcii3j31hspv4g4vnvq", "context": {"position": 100.02, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3p8bl98bt4uuijd9p1v55t2nk5id4hfj", "context": {"position": 100.02, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/jb72tlgel2347aqfb5insslbuodu1shj", "context": {"position": 100.02, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/v5dd0o92du3hf9tjeikph0v7nmeud9i1", "context": {"position": 100.02, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/i8k8gndk2fv2mfo9mbuf0jinsamikvuc", "context": {"position": 100.02, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/i6ieuh35lmoduebs0v9e6ioa7vsedc3o", "context": {"position": 100.02, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Business", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2023/04/27/business", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/nrarar8l4gh0clci3vbkb4ok79ppevnf", "publication": [{"id": "/content/7muvl5mgi1q35gdgs3k98ik2rq4ei6ne", "context": {"position": 100.03, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/60jbbpq8pd0p2qcii3j31hspv4g4vnvq", "context": {"position": 100.03, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3p8bl98bt4uuijd9p1v55t2nk5id4hfj", "context": {"position": 100.03, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/jb72tlgel2347aqfb5insslbuodu1shj", "context": {"position": 100.03, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/v5dd0o92du3hf9tjeikph0v7nmeud9i1", "context": {"position": 100.03, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/i8k8gndk2fv2mfo9mbuf0jinsamikvuc", "context": {"position": 100.03, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/i6ieuh35lmoduebs0v9e6ioa7vsedc3o", "context": {"position": 100.03, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "KAL\u2019s cartoon", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2023/04/27/kals-cartoon", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
