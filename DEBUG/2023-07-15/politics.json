Mr Pita\u2019s pro-democracy Move Forward party claimed the most seats in May\u2019s general election and he has the support of other reformist parties. He needs the votes of half of the 749 lawmakers in parliament to become prime minister, but is being fiercely resisted by parties aligned with the conservative military establishment.   \n\nAt least ten people were killed in election-day violence in West Bengal. The Indian state went to the polls to choose rural councils. Dozens of people have died in violence in the state since the election date was called a month ago. \nAt the UN Security Council Russia used its veto to block a nine-month extension of a deal that allows aid to cross from Turkey to  north-west Syria. Others had pushed for a year-long extension but Russia, which is a key ally of the Syrian government, has said it will accept only six months. \n\nMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, went to the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank for the first time in over a decade. His visit came a week after an Israeli incursion into Jenin refugee camp, which Mr Abbas vowed to rebuild. The Palestinian Authority has lost influence and power in the territory in recent years.\nIsrael\u2019s Knesset approved the first reading of a controversial judicial-reform bill. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, had removed one of the most contentious parts of the bill that would have allowed parliament to overrule Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. But protests still broke out around Israel.\nThe army-aligned faction involved in Sudan\u2019s civil war, which broke out in mid-April, said it would not attend a peace conference to be held under the auspices of  the Intergovernmental Authority on Development in eastern Africa. America and Saudi Arabia, which had previously arranged a series of short-lived ceasefires, have suspended their peace efforts. So there is no sign of an end to the war.\nIn Guatemala a senior prosecutor persuaded a court to ban the party of Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, an anti-corruption presidential candidate who is to face Sandra Torres, a former first lady, in a run-off on August 20th. Mr Ar\u00e9valo said the court\u2019s decision was \u201cspurious\u201d and would not stop him from contesting the election. Confirmation of the results of the first round had been delayed, raising suspicions that the country\u2019s elite is trying to thwart Mr Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s anti-graft campaign. \nPemex, Mexico\u2019s state oil firm, will probably lose at least 2m barrels of oil this month after a huge fire at an offshore platform, according to reports, which also say that Mexico\u2019s oil regulator failed to collect three fines issued against the company. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador sees Pemex as a vital part of the country\u2019s attempts to become self-sufficient in energy. It is the world\u2019s most-indebted oil company.\nAmerica applied sanctions to ten individuals and a firm in Mexico in an attempt to slow the supply of fentanyl, one cause of America\u2019s opioid epidemic. Some of those on the list are connected to the Sinaloa cartel, which is  run by \u201cLos Chapitos\u201d, the collective name for the sons of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is in prison in America. \nThe US Marine Corps was left without a leader because a Republican senator from Alabama is holding up the confirmation of military appointments to their posts in a row over the Pentagon\u2019s policy of supporting abortions for female personnel.  Tommy Tuberville argues that he, and not the Defence Department, has been elected to represent his state. \nHuw and cry\nFollowing days of intense media speculation, Huw Edwards, the BBC\u2019s most famous news presenter, was revealed to be the man who allegedly made payments to a young person, who is now 20, for explicit photographs. The lurid affair has raised more questions about the state of British journalism. The young person\u2019s lawyers said the claims, published in the Sun newspaper, were nonsense and the police ruled out any criminal charges. Mr Edwards has been admitted to hospital for mental-health treatment.", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Politics", "section": {"url": {"canonical":

"https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2023/07/13/politics", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "NATO held a summit in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, which was dominated by Ukraine\u2019s ambition to join the alliance. Amid resistance from some members, notably America and Germany, to give a firm timetable, NATO issued a pledge that Ukraine will join, but only when \u201callies agree and conditions are met\u201d. It was, however, promised as an accelerated process. More important was a pledge by the G7 that its members will each offer Ukraine enduring commitments to provide it with the weapons it needs to defend itself from Russia during and after the war, as well as help with rebuilding its economy.\nTurkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he would now support Sweden\u2019s bid to join NATO, reversing months of opposition as the last country in the alliance to resist its membership. Before changing course, Mr Erdogan was widely condemned for suggesting that he would only support Sweden if the EU opened new talks on Turkey\u2019s ambition to join the bloc. America provided a different incentive, promising to \u201cmove ahead\u201d with supplying F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. \nBefore the NATO summit America announced that it would provide Ukraine with cluster munitions to use in its fight against Russia. Joe Biden said the decision had been difficult, given the risk to civilians from their use. Ukraine\u2019s defence minister gave assurances that the cluster bombs would not be used in urban areas. \nVladimir Putin met Yevgeny Prigozhin just five days after the aborted mutiny of Mr Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner mercenary troops, according to the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman. The meeting, which Wagner\u2019s top commanders also attended, was held in Moscow. \nExit, stage centre-right\nThe Dutch government collapsed, after the parties in the ruling coalition failed to agree on immigration policy. Mark Rutte, the prime minister, had wanted to toughen the entry requirements for some migrants. He has said he will quit politics following a general election in November, ending the career of one of Europe\u2019s canniest operators. Mr Rutte has been prime minister of the Netherlands since 2010, managing to hold often fractious coalitions together. \nThe European Union\u2019s population rose by 2m to 448m in 2022, the first increase since the for two years following the pandemic. More people still died than were born, but migration made up the shortfall. Germany\u2019s population rose by 1.1m people, to 84.4m.\nA month after hosting NATO\u2019s biggest ever air exercise, Germany said it would for the first time send troops to Australia to participate in war games involving principally American and Australian forces that are held once every two years. The Talisman Sabre exercise, which includes troops from Japan, South Korea and elsewhere, always unnerves China.\n\nChina signed a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d with the Solomon Islands, which will include more Chinese help for the Pacific nation\u2019s police force. China is also building a telecoms network across the islands. Last month the Solomons\u2019 prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, called for a review of his country\u2019s defence arrangements with Australia, which has long been an ally and aid provider.\nNorth Korea test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile, which fell into the sea short of Japanese waters. In its latest flurry of sabre-rattling, North Korea has ranted against what it describes as \u201cair patrols\u201d by American aircraft off the Korean peninsula.\nPita Limjaroenrat\u2019s bid to become Thailand\u2019s prime minister failed in the first round of voting in parliament, which recorded around 200 abstentions. Mr Pita\u2019s pro-democracy Move Forward party claimed the most seats in May\u2019s general election and he has the support of other reformist parties. He needs the votes of half of the 749 lawmakers in parliament to become prime minister, but is being fiercely resisted by parties aligned with the conservative military establishment.   \n\nAt least ten people were killed in election-day violence in West Bengal. The Indian state went to the polls to choose rural councils. Dozens of people have died in violence in the state since the election date was called a month ago. \nAt the UN Security Council Russia used its veto to block a nine-month extension of a deal that allows aid to cross from Turkey to  north-west Syria. Others had pushed for a year-long extension but Russia, which is a key ally of the Syrian government, has said it will accept only six months. \n\nMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, went to the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank for the first time in over a decade. His visit came a week after an Israeli incursion into Jenin refugee camp, which Mr Abbas vowed to rebuild. The Palestinian Authority has lost influence and power in the territory in recent years.\nIsrael\u2019s Knesset approved the first reading of a controversial judicial-reform bill. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, had removed one of the most contentious parts of the bill that would have allowed parliament to overrule Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. But protests still broke out around Israel.\nThe army-aligned faction involved in Sudan\u2019s civil war, which broke out in mid-April, said it would not attend a peace conference to be held under the auspices of  the Intergovernmental Authority on Development in eastern Africa. America and Saudi Arabia, which had previously arranged a series of short-lived ceasefires, have suspended their peace efforts. So there is no sign of an end to the war.\nIn Guatemala a senior prosecutor persuaded a court to ban the party of Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, an anti-corruption presidential candidate who is to face Sandra Torres, a former first lady, in a run-off on August 20th. Mr Ar\u00e9valo said the court\u2019s decision was \u201cspurious\u201d and would not stop him from contesting the election. Confirmation of the results of the first round had been delayed, raising suspicions that the country\u2019s elite is trying to thwart Mr Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s anti-graft campaign. \nPemex, Mexico\u2019s state oil firm, will probably lose at least 2m barrels of oil this month after a huge fire at an offshore platform, according to reports, which also say that Mexico\u2019s oil regulator failed to collect three fines issued against the company. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador sees Pemex as a vital part of the country\u2019s attempts to become self-sufficient in energy. It is the world\u2019s most-indebted oil company.\nAmerica applied sanctions to ten individuals and a firm in Mexico in an attempt to slow the supply of fentanyl, one cause of America\u2019s opioid epidemic. Some of those on the list are connected to the Sinaloa cartel, which is  run by \u201cLos Chapitos\u201d, the collective name for the sons of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is in prison in America. \nThe US Marine Corps was left without a leader because a Republican senator from Alabama is holding up the confirmation of military appointments to their posts in a row over the Pentagon\u2019s policy of supporting abortions for female personnel.  Tommy Tuberville argues that he, and not the Defence Department, has been elected to represent his state. \nHuw and cry\nFollowing days of intense media speculation, Huw Edwards, the BBC\u2019s most famous news presenter, was revealed to be the man who allegedly made payments to a young person, who is now 20, for explicit photographs. The lurid affair has raised more questions about the state of British journalism. The young person\u2019s lawyers said the claims, published in the Sun newspaper, were nonsense and the police ruled out any criminal charges. Mr Edwards has been admitted to hospital for mental-health treatment.", "description": "", "ogDescription": "", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230715_WWP002.jpg",
