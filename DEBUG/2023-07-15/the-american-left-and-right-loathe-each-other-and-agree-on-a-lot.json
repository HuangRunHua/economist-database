"articleBody": "NORMALLY, YOU need read only the first six or seven words of a senator\u2019s sentence to be able to correctly surmise his party. See if you can tell from the next 40 or so, an extract culled from a prominent senator\u2019s recent book: \u201cToday, neoliberalism is in. In the eyes of our elites, the spread and support of free trade should come before all other concerns\u2014personal, political and geopolitical. In recent years this has led to a kind of \u2018free-market fundamentalism\u2019.\u201d Suppose you were given a hint. The three proposed solutions for the neoliberal malaise are: \u201cputting Wall Street in its place\u201d, bringing \u201ccritical industries back to America\u201d and resurrecting \u201can obligation to rebuild America\u2019s workforce\u201d.\nIf you guessed a Democrat\u2014perhaps even more cleverly Bernie Sanders writing in his recent work, \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be Angry About Capitalism\u201d\u2014you would be wrong. It was in fact Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida and one-time presidential contender, writing in his just-published book, \u201cDecades of Decadence\u201d.\nThe populist era marked by Donald Trump\u2019s ascension has been tumultuous for economic policy on both the American left and right. What was once heterodox has quickly become orthodox. It is easy to be drawn to where the new left and the new right are diametrically opposed, because partisans amplify disagreement, and because there are real differences on the role of policing, say, or whether pupils ought to be schooled in gender fluidity. What the culture wars distract from is that, on matters of economic policy, there is rather a lot of agreement. The culture wars may even have hastened the convergence between the two sides by quickening the break-up between the Republican Party and big business, which is now commonly derided as just another redoubt of wokeness.\nThe diagnoses from the new right and new left of what ails America are strikingly similar. Both sides agree that the old order that prized expertise, free markets and free trade\u2014\u201cneoliberalism\u201d, usually invoked as a pejorative\u2014was a rotten deal for America. Corporations were too immoral; elites too feckless; globalisation too costly; inequality too unchecked; the invisible hand too prone to error.\nThese problems, both sides agree, must be rectified by the state, through the use of tariffs and industrial policy to boost favoured industries. That should be coupled with greater redistribution, to the detriment of corporations and to the benefit of left-behind workers. When Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, who is tasked with making something called \u201ca foreign policy for the middle class\u201d a reality, endorsed the idea that the administration\u2019s domestic economic policies represented a \u201cnew Washington consensus\u201d in April, he was speaking grandly but not incorrectly.\nFor wonks pushing in this direction, that is great news. \u201cIt is a sign of a healthy politics that you have people with their eyes open on both sides of the political spectrum saying, \u2018This is really broken,\u2019\u201d says Oren Cass, a former policy adviser to Mitt Romney and now the executive director of American Compass, a think-tank leading the charge on the right. In June the organisation released an anthology of policy essays called \u201cRebuilding American Capitalism: A Handbook for Conservative Policymakers\u201d that resembles a slaughterhouse for Republican sacred cows.\nTrade deficits are obsessed over; federal budget deficits are hardly mentioned. Child benefits for parents should be made much more generous, as Democrats suggest, though only on the condition that parents work. Financial engineering should be resisted, with share buy-backs banned. Organised labour is to be encouraged rather than being dismissed as a hindrance. \u201cConservative economics, unlike the fundamentalism that supplanted it for a time, begins with a confident assertion of what the market is for and then considers the public policies necessary for shaping markets toward that end,\u201d Mr Cass writes at the start of the manifesto.\nThis is apparently a catchy proposition. Most of the young guard of Republican senators who are trying to fashion populist economic policy\u2014like Tom Cotton of Arkansas, J.D. Vance of Ohio and Todd Young of Indiana\u2014gave lengthy interviews at an event to celebrate its unveiling. Mr Rubio was there, too; his recent book of recriminations against the decadent technocratic, neoliberal elite is studded with references to Mr Cass and his writings.\nThe idea that capitalism has inherent contradictions that require government intervention is more usually associated with the left. But Thomas Piketty, the famed French chronicler of inequality, is also optimistic that there is a broader ideological shift under way. \u201cBeginning with the 2008 financial crisis, we\u2019ve seen the beginning of the end of this sort of neoliberal euphoria and the pandemic accelerated this transformation,\u201d he reckons.\nMr Biden is doing \u201cinteresting things\u201d when it comes to industrial policy, says Mr Piketty\u2014who freely admits his preference for the more revolutionary Democratic alternatives like Elizabeth Warren and Mr Sanders over the centrist Mr Biden. The president, he says, is \u201cnot really questioning the very high level of inequality that we have in the US today\u201d.\nThis is a critique that those in the Biden administration might heed. There are more than a few casual fans of Mr Piketty in the White House. Heather Boushey, a member of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, helped edit an entire volume of economic essays titled \u201cAfter Piketty\u201d. Even as a tight labour market after the pandemic increased wages for the lowest-paid workers, top incomes continued to rise, causing some measures of inequality either to rise or remain stuck at stubbornly high levels. Mr Piketty had called for a return to the high marginal tax rates on income in effect in the three decades after the second world war, as well as a new steeply progressive wealth tax to finance a generous welfare state.\nThis is one difference between new right and new left. Mr Biden has taken on board the idea that extreme wealth at the top of the distribution is a problem that needs tackling, and insists that he will not raise taxes on those earning less than $400,000 a year (98% of Americans fall below that threshold). Mr Cass and co spend less time fretting that the top 2% are doing too well. Though since Mr Biden has not managed to actually raise taxes on top earners, the difference is moot.\nAll of which leads Mr Piketty to worry that America could have a \u201cneoliberal stabilisation\u201d at a very high level of inequality, or continue to flirt with alternative systems like the \u201cneo-nationalism\u201d embodied by Mr Trump. He also worries that some of the leftish industrial policy that the Biden administration has championed, and which plenty of Republicans would copy, is in fact something more retrograde in disguise. \u201cSome of what we call industrial policy today looks a lot like subsidies and sort of a new wave of tax competition and a race to the bottom,\u201d he says.\nCrossing the Piketty line\nAside from the focus on the super-rich, the differences between the new left and new right on economic matters can be hard to detect. Those on the left often discuss social policy as something that happens between state and individual; the right insists that the family remain the intermediating institution. Both find competition with China to be a justification for industrial policy; but the new right does not find the threat of climate change to be nearly so moving. There is little appetite on either side to reform entitlement programmes before the trust funds that hold cash for old-age-pension and health benefits are depleted within the next decade.\nBoth the new left and the new right agree on empowering workers but disagree on the means. \u201cThe Democratic Party is just completely committed at this point to strengthening existing unions,\u201d says Mr Cass. He prefers alternative ways of organising labour like sectoral bargaining, or a German-style co-determination system in which a set number of corporate-board seats are reserved for workers (an arrangement also praised by Mr Piketty).\nIf there is so much agreement, why is Congress not enacting more laws that reflect the new consensus? The main reason is that mutual suspicion on matters of culture, the primary currency of contemporary politics, infect whatever new economic consensus there is. A wholesale refashioning of America therefore won\u2019t come soon. But the ideas are already proving to be more than a mere passing fad.\u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state
