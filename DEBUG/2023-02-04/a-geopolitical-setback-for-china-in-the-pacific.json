In April 2022 it signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands that laid the ground for Chinese forces to operate there. Later in the spring China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, sealed several more deals on an unprecedented eight-country Pacific tour. Although he didn\u2019t quite nail down a broader regional security agreement, he made it clear that China would keep pushing for it. \u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous,\u201d he told Pacific leaders back then. \nNerves are more likely to be jangling now among Chinese officials. On January 25th they suffered one of their worst setbacks in the region when Sitiveni Rabuka, Fiji\u2019s prime minister, suddenly announced that he would terminate a security agreement with China dating to 2011. It had allowed Fijian police officers to train in China and Chinese officers to work in Fiji for up to six months at a time. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to continue,\u201d Mr Rabuka told the Fiji Times. \u201cOur systems are different.\u201d \n\nWorse still for China, Mr Rabuka said that police officers from Australia and New Zealand could continue to work in Fiji because their political systems were similar to the Pacific-island country\u2019s. His decision dealt a blow not just to Chinese efforts to secure a strategic foothold in a region long dominated militarily by America and its allies. It also undermined China\u2019s efforts to present its political system as a superior alternative to liberal democracy. And it comes as China\u2019s maritime neighbours in the South China Sea are pushing back against it, too. \nMr Rabuka\u2019s move appears to be as much about establishing his own authority at home as about great-power competition. His predecessor, Frank Bainimarama, hatched the deal with China in 2011 to compensate for his then poor relations with America and its regional allies, Australia and New Zealand. All three had imposed sanctions on Fiji after Mr Bainimarama seized power in a coup in 2006. They lifted them after he won democratic elections in 2014, but he continued to pursue economic and security ties with China. \nMr Bainimarama lost an election in December. He initially conceded defeat but later backtracked, calling for senior officials to refuse the new government\u2019s demand that they resign. In the election\u2019s aftermath, the police chief called in the armed forces, citing a risk of ethnic unrest. That raised fears of another coup. Fiji has seen four since its independence from Britain in 1970\u2014including two by Mr Rabuka. The police chief, who was close to Mr Bainimarama, was suspended on the same day the China deal was scrapped. Concerns about Fiji\u2019s political instability endure. \nEven so, the termination of China\u2019s deal is a geopolitical win for America and its allies. China has recently sought to upgrade its links in the Pacific in a bid to contest America\u2019s influence and establish a military foothold there. Though it denies seeking a base, China has probably approached Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands about one, the Pentagon says. China also recently donated more combat-related kit to Pacific countries, giving Fiji a naval vessel in 2018 and 47 military vehicles in 2022. A Chinese police liaison officer has been based in Fiji since 2021. China\u2019s embassy in Fiji responded to Mr Rabuka\u2019s decision by saying that no external force would disrupt their military and police co-operation.\nSince China\u2019s Solomons deal, America and its allies have stepped up their diplomatic and economic engagement in the region. President Joe Biden hosted 12 Pacific leaders (including Mr Bainimarama) at the White House in September. They agreed to work together to build a region in which \u201cdemocracy will be able to flourish\u201d. America also pledged to provide an additional $810m in aid to the region. \nAustralia\u2019s foreign minister, Penny Wong, has been active too, visiting several Pacific nations, including Fiji. In October Australia and Fiji signed agreements on expanding police co-operation and deploying military forces on each other\u2019s territory. The Chinese government, meanwhile, is pressing ahead with its agreement with the Solomons, which sent 32 police officers to train in China in October. China also held a virtual meeting with police officials from six Pacific countries in November. It will no doubt have more to offer. For the moment, though, last year\u2019s Pacific foray is starting to look like overreach. \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes
