Revenue fell in the last three months of 2022, year on year, but is expected to rise in this quarter. Still, Reality Labs, the division tasked with creating the metaverse, ran up another loss, of $4.3bn, taking its total loss for the year to $13.7bn. \nSharing the driving seat\nAfter months of sometimes troublesome negotiations, Nissan and Renault announced a restructuring of their two-decade-old alliance, which has been under strain since the fall from grace in 2018 of Carlos Ghosn, who had run both carmakers. The main feature of the agreement is a reduction in Renault\u2019s stake in Nissan to 15% from 43%, with the remainder of Renault\u2019s shares in Nissan to be put into a French trust and the voting rights \u201cneutralised\u201d. Each company will now own a working 15% stake in the other, which tackles a key concern of Nissan that the partnership had been unequal. \nExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell reported record annual profits of $56bn, $37bn and $40bn respectively. All three benefited from the higher price of energy amid the war in Ukraine, though prices have been falling in recent months. \nUnilever appointed a new chief executive to replace Alan Jope, who is standing down in July. Hein Schumacher is currently the boss of the world\u2019s largest dairy co-operative, which is based in the Netherlands. He\u2019ll take the reins of the consumer-goods conglomerate amid investor unease about its lagging share price, and criticism from some quarters about its purpose-driven approach to selling mayonnaise. \nSalesforce, which is also under pressure from investors to improve its stock performance, appointed three independent directors. This came shortly after Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund, took a small stake in the software company.\nThe amount of money wiped off the value of Gautam Adani\u2019s companies since Hindenburg Research, an American short-seller, said that their stock was artificially inflated passed $108bn. Adani Group forcefully denies the charges. More than $50bn has been wiped from the Indian billionaire\u2019s fortune. \nThe Federal Reserve lifted its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of between 4.5% and 4.75%, the highest it has been since September 2007. It was the smallest increase since the Fed embarked on a course of tightening monetary policy last March. \nFaced with higher inflation rates than America the European Central Bank and the Bank of England each raised their main rate by half a percentage point. The ECB\u2019s deposit rate is now 2.5%. The Bank of England\u2019s base rate is 4%, its highest level since 2008. \nAmerica\u2019s stockmarkets had a strong start to 2023. The NASDAQ composite rose by 10.7% in January, its best start to the year since 2001. The S&P 500 was up by 6.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 2.8%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, a star performer amid last year\u2019s dismal market rout, also rose, by 4.3%.\n\nThe IMF raised its forecast slightly of world GDP this year, which it now thinks will grow by 2.9%. The fund believes that \u201cadverse risks have moderated\u201d since its previous estimate in October, noting that global inflation is expected to fall to 6.6% (from 8.8% last year) and that China\u2019s reopening after covid lockdowns will boost demand. Europe has also proved resilient despite the war in Ukraine and high energy prices. The IMF even reckons that Russia\u2019s economy will grow by 0.3%, a contrast to a recent report from the World Bank, which forecast that it would shrink by 3.3%.\nThe euro area\u2019s economy grew by 1.9% in the final quarter of 2022, year on year, helped by government support on energy bills and mild weather, which dampened fuel demand. The currency bloc\u2019s GDP expanded by 3.5% over the whole year. Annual consumer-price inflation slowed to 8.5% in January, from 9.2% in December.\nSouth Korea reported a trade deficit of $47.5bn in 2022, the largest since records began in 1956. In January of this year the deficit came in at $12.7bn, the highest ever for a month. Exports of Korean chips and other tech have shrivelled while prices for imports of fuel and commodities have surged. This week Samsung Electronics reported its worst quarterly performance in eight years. Profit from semiconductors plunged by 97%, year on year. \nIntel\u2019s chief executive and other senior managers are to take big pay cuts, after the chipmaker reported a surprise quarterly loss and plunging sales.
