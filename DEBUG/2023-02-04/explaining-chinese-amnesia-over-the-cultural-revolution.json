By Tania Branigan. W.W. Norton; 288 pages; $29.95. Faber & Faber; \u00a320\nAt first glance Zhang Hongbing is deserving of pity. In the 1960s, while still a teenager, he watched his father being beaten until his urine ran red. The older man, a veteran of China\u2019s Communist Party, had been accused of being a capitalist. Then Mr Zhang\u2019s mother, Fang, fell under suspicion. She was branded a counter-revolutionary and later executed.\nSuch horrors were not uncommon during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, a decade of Maoist madness that began in 1966. Gangs of Red Guards, whipped up by Mao Zedong, persecuted those deemed too capitalist, traditional or reactionary. Frenzied young people led the initial charge, though the fighting between rival adult factions was more deadly. In all, as many as 2m people were killed in the upheaval; the lives of many millions more were ruined.\nWhat makes the death of Fang stand out is that her husband and son had themselves been her accusers. Mr Zhang tells Tania Branigan, the author of \u201cRed Memory\u201d, that he saw his mother as a \u201cmonster\u201d after she insulted Mao. Father and son then left to report her, probably knowing she would be killed. Today Mr Zhang is repentant. Yet his memory seems odd: \u201cHe existed in it not as a human who loved and feared and doubted, but as a Maoist algorithm: inputs, rules, outputs.\u201d \nHow people remember that horrible decade\u2014or why they have forgotten it\u2014is the underlying theme of this penetrating and perceptive book. Ms Branigan has spoken to those who experienced the revolution as victims, perpetrators or both. Mr Zhang is more open than most Chinese. Some have been silenced; some fear repercussions. \u201cOthers hush as if it were a curse, so powerful that its very mention darkens current peace and prosperity,\u201d writes the author. \u201cAnd so the party and those it rules have conspired in amnesia.\u201d\nUnder Mao\u2019s successor as paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, the party admitted the Cultural Revolution was a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. Deng himself had been purged\u2014twice. His resolution stated: \u201cIt is impermissible to overlook or whitewash mistakes, which in itself would be a mistake and would give rise to more and worse mistakes.\u201d It attacked Mao\u2019s personality cult and tyrannical style. Around the same time, books about the trauma, called \u201cscar literature\u201d, appeared. This was the closest China has come to a reckoning.\nChina\u2019s current leader, Xi Jinping, was also a victim. His father, who had fought alongside Mao in China\u2019s civil war, was persecuted. His half-sister reportedly killed herself during the period. Mr Xi himself was sent to live in a cave in the countryside for seven years. Today the party paints this as a formative experience, one that turned Mr Xi into a man of the people. That is in keeping with his attacks on \u201chistorical nihilism\u201d. China\u2019s online censors have deleted millions of posts containing \u201charmful\u201d discussion of the past.\nMr Xi was disgusted by the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. But his version of party history, produced in 2021, removes references to Deng\u2019s verdict and his warnings about one-man rule. Mr Xi has accumulated more power than any leader since Mao and created his own cult of personality. The Cultural Revolution\u2019s legacy is thus more relevant than ever, writes Ms Branigan. But, she notes, there is \u201can inverse relationship between utility and acceptability: what makes the era\u2019s lessons so vital is also what makes them impermissible.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on
