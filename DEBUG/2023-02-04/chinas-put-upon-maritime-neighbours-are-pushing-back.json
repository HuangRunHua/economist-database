Connecting East Asia\u2019s economic miracle with much of the rest of the world, its waters play an outsize role in global maritime trade and security. Yet there is a problem. All seven nations that border the sea maintain overlapping rights to it. And one of them, China, claims nearly the entire maritime expanse\u2014and struts about it like a municipal swimming-bath bully.\nWith massive terraforming, China has turned remote reefs into airstrips and bases. It uses its navy and coastguard, as well as \u201cmaritime militias\u201d of armed fishing fleets, to intimidate its South-East Asian neighbours. It forcibly curtails their fishing and exploration for hydrocarbons. It is obstructing the Philippines\u2019 efforts to resupply a remote island outpost. Yet for the first time in a decade, China is no longer making all the running in and around the sea. South-East Asians are at last refusing to yield to its provocations. This might\u2014just\u2014represent a turning-point in their struggle against the regional thug.\nMuch of the discord concerns maps. China\u2019s infamous \u201cnine-dash line\u201d is a tongue of cartographic aggression sticking out over 700 nautical miles from the Chinese coast. Its alleged basis is as vague as it is unfounded in international law. In 2016 a tribunal at The Hague\u2014in a case brought by the Philippines\u2014struck down most of China\u2019s claims, ruling them inconsistent with the un Convention of the Law of the Sea (unclos).\nSince then other countries with rival claims in the South China Sea, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and tiny Brunei, have insisted that international law must form the basis of any settlement of their disputes. In legal discussions with China, a senior South-East Asian diplomat notes, its maritime neighbours are taking enormous care not even to acknowledge its bogus nine-dash line claims. Partly as a result, China is seeing its various proposals to individual countries\u2014for a bilateral fisheries agreement, say, or a deal on jointly exploring for hydrocarbons\u2014turned down. Similarly, China is failing, after years of negotiations bedevilled by the outrageousness of its demands, to cajole the ten-country Association of South-East Asian Nations (asean) into signing off on a tension-reducing code of conduct in the sea. China wants, in effect, a right to veto whatever naval exercises or oil and gas projects asean members might wish to conduct with outside powers. But they are having none of that. And it is hardly good optics for China that the negotiations continue to breeze past whatever deadline it calls for. \nEver more obviously, South-East Asians are mastering and applying international law to push back against China. Malaysia\u2019s submission to the un in 2019 for an extended continental shelf implied yet another rebuke of China\u2019s nine-dash line. Even more significant is a recent agreement between Indonesia and Vietnam to demarcate their exclusive economic zones. Huong Le Thu of the Perth USAsia Centre, an Australian think-tank, considers it an important model for South-East Asian countries to resolve claims among themselves.\nHard-nosed types will reply that what matters is what takes place on the water. There China\u2019s naval, coastguard and especially \u201cgrey zone\u201d activities, whereby Chinese vessels swarm reefs and obstruct fishermen, have not let up. Yet some pushback to them, too, is apparent. Vietnam is reinforcing its outposts on the Spratly Islands. Military ties between the Philippines and the United States are rapidly thickening. Last year the two countries launched a \u201cmaritime dialogue\u201d on grey-zone threats in the sea. Senior Biden administration officials have since flowed to Manila. The defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, visited this week to secure expanded access to Philippine bases. It was reported on February 2nd that an agreement had been struck granting America four new sites, in addition to the five it is already using. \nNone of the South-East Asian states wants to provoke China openly\u2014that is not the asean way. But an increasingly steadfast spirit of resistance is a growing feature of their response, in various spheres, to Chinese assertiveness. Even as China becomes less welcome in the South Pacific, it may be too much to think of it being pushed back in the South China Sea. But after a decade of China swanning about it unchecked, the maritime region\u2019s emerging stalemate is welcome.\u25a0\nRead more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia:\nThe Rohingyas long for their homes in Myanmar, but cannot go back (Jan 26th)\nWho gets to define what Asia means?
