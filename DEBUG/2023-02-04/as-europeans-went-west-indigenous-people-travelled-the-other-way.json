By Caroline Dodds Pennock. Knopf; 320 pages; $32.50. Orion; \u00a322\nIn recent decades indigenous people around the world have fought to rebuild cultures wrecked by colonialism, invoking a common phrase: \u201cWe are still here.\u201d From protests against oil pipelines to bids to reclaim land, and from the revival of native cuisines to indigenous stories on screen, a renaissance is refuting the tired view that these cultures are vanishing. \nAccording to Caroline Dodds Pennock\u2019s absorbing account of indigenous peoples in 16th-century Europe, their roles in earlier history have been simplified or erased, too. \u201cOn Savage Shores\u201d shatters the Eurocentric assumption that, half a millennium ago, people and ideas flowed in only one direction, from the old world to the \u201cnew\u201d. Her study painstakingly reconstructs the first century of contact between colonial powers and the peoples of the Americas, documenting thousands of natives who travelled east, often involuntarily, to a continent they considered no less \u201csavage\u201d than the conquistadors had found their own.\nLong before Buffalo Bill\u2019s Wild West shows began touring Europe in the late 19th century\u2014and even before the first permanent English settlement in North America, at Jamestown in 1607\u2014indigenous people lived in European courts and cities. Ms Dodds Pennock, a scholar of Mesoamerica, mainly focuses on the peoples of Central and South America, which were invaded and exploited by conquistadors from Spain and Portugal. But readers meet scores of individuals ferried across the Atlantic, from Nunatsiavut, Roanoke and Brazil to London, Seville and Rouen.\nAfter trumpeting his \u201cdiscovery\u201d of America in 1492, on his next trip Christopher Columbus focused on kidnapping Ta\u00edno people from the Caribbean to sell as slaves at home. One Ta\u00edno boy he \u201cadopted\u201d as his own was the first of many \u00e9migr\u00e9s forcibly Christianised to justify the Spaniards\u2019 \u201ccivilising mission\u201d. For his part, after laying waste to the Aztec capital in 1519, Hernando Cort\u00e9s sent the gifts offered by its ruler, Moctezuma, back to the Spanish king. These included a hoard of exquisite gold and silver treasures\u2014and at least five emissaries from the Totonac people of Mexico, who barely rated a mention in one observer\u2019s breathless report. \nOnly through oral histories and forensic reading of archival documents can the voices of such travellers be heard, the author writes. By 1600 as many as 2m people from the Americas were enslaved, she recounts, many of them transported to Europe. Some high-ranking travellers came as diplomats trying to broker better conditions for their people; others were forced into service as interpreters. Two such intermediaries arrived in London in 1584 with Sir Walter Ralegh and were instrumental in developing an Algonquian written alphabet (credited solely to Ralegh\u2019s navigator, Thomas Hariot).\nMeanwhile, for all the splashy biographies of indigenous American crops like cacao and tobacco, says Ms Dodds Pennock, those who grew and sold such goods were overlooked for centuries and are still neglected. Perhaps unconsciously, Europeans emulated indigenous peoples\u2019 rituals for smoking and coffee-drinking; but, the author argues, they failed to adopt their system of \u201creciprocity between the land and its inhabitants\u201d. She cautions against romanticising indigenous beliefs, yet notes that \u201cEuropean value-systems tended to extraction and profit, rather than sustainability and the sharing of resources.\u201d\nThe impact on European culture of these travellers is hard to measure. It is clear in language: Quechua provided jerky and quinoa; the Aztec-Mexica tongue supplied avocado and chocolate. The book\u2019s wider claim\u2014that the indigenous presence shaped European society\u2014is less convincing. Still, the views of native peoples on their colonisers continue to resonate. Michel de Montaigne, a French essayist, inquiring of three Tupinamb\u00e1 from present-day Brazil, reported their wonder at how \u201camong us some men were overstuffed with all sorts of rich commodities while their [compatriots] were begging at their doors, emaciated from hunger.\u201d \u25a0\nCorrection (February 6th 2023): An earlier version of this article referred to coffee as an indigenous American crop. We meant to say cacao. This has been corrected. Sorry.\n\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter", "description": "Caroline Dodds Pennock remembers their
