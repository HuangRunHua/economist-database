But the scale of the backlash from the United States it has provoked may be. At a press conference in his embassy in Asunci\u00f3n on January 26th, Marc Ostfield, the us ambassador, unveiled harsh new sanctions on the two most powerful figures in the ruling Colorado Party. Horacio Cartes, the country\u2019s president from 2013 to 2018, and Hugo Vel\u00e1zquez, the current vice-president, are accused of \u201crampant corruption\u201d and ties to terrorists. \nMr Cartes, a rich businessman, is accused of having paid party members as much as $10,000 to back his presidential candidacy. He also allegedly greased legislators\u2019 palms with up to $50,000 a month and promised to split $1m between them if they amended the constitution to allow his re-election. For more than a decade, the Biden administration argues, Mr Cartes has \u201cleveraged his illicitly acquired wealth and influence to expand his political and economic power over Paraguayan institutions.\u201d Mr Vel\u00e1zquez is accused of making threats and offering bribes to \u201cprotect himself and criminal associates\u201d. Both men deny all the allegations.\nAmerica also accuses the two of sending representatives to collect bribes in exchange for state contracts and favours at events in Paraguay staged by Hizbullah, a Lebanese Islamic militant group that is backed by Iran and designated a terrorist organisation by the United States. The two are now blocked from doing business with American citizens and banks. Earlier sanctions already barred them and their families from American soil.\nThere was a time when the United States was kinder to Paraguay\u2019s rulers. As dictator from 1954 to 1989, Alfredo Stroessner bought the loyalty of his generals and the Colorado Party by allowing the smuggling of whisky, cars and cocaine into Brazil. But at least until 1977, America trained Paraguayan soldiers, provided guns and helicopters, and helped the country secure multilateral loans and aid. \nThe world has changed, and Paraguayan graft has worsened. In South America, only in Venezuela are perceptions of official corruption more acute, according to Transparency International, an ngo. This is bad for Paraguay\u2019s 7m people, and matters far beyond its borders. Drug gangs as well as Hizbullah and other groups increasingly use the country as a staging-post. It is South America\u2019s leading marijuana producer and an important pipeline for Andean cocaine.  Record hauls of it are being found stashed in shipments of Paraguayan paint, rice and soyabeans. Journalists, officials and bystanders are murdered with alarming frequency.\nMr Cartes has 30 businesses\u2014television stations, hotels, ranches, banks, pharmacies and supermarkets. The jewel in his crown is Tabesa, a maker of cigarettes. Millions of packs are smuggled abroad every year, especially from Ciudad del Este in the triborder area near Argentina and Brazil. They are reportedly sold by a gallery of rogues: FARC guerrillas in Colombia, the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico, and the pCC, a ruthless Brazilian narco-multinational. \nMr Cartes\u2019s people insist that Tabesa\u2019s sales are \u201c100% legal\u201d. They point out that the company is Paraguay\u2019s biggest taxpayer and has never been charged with smuggling\u2014a phenomenon they blame on higher foreign duties on cigarettes. The American allegations, they claim, were \u201corchestrated\u201d by the current president, Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez, a rival to Mr Cartes in the Colorado Party. America, they allege, hopes to swing the presidential election due in April in favour of Mr Cartes\u2019s enemies. They argue that no Paraguayan enjoys a warmer relationship with Israel\u2014Hizbullah\u2019s sworn enemy\u2014than Mr Cartes. As for Mr Vel\u00e1zquez\u2014a former prosecutor in Ciudad del Este\u2014his lawyer says the allegations are \u201ccompletely false\u201d and that \u201cno one has done more for the fight against organised criminality in Paraguay.\u201d\nA stream of allegations\nIn recent years, judges, navy officials, congressmen, prison guards, policemen, cabinet ministers and health officials have all been implicated in breathtaking corruption schemes, mostly escaping serious punishment. Of late, the sleaze has taken on a scarier edge. Kattya Gonz\u00e1lez, an opposition congresswoman, says many of her fellow legislators are bankrolled by gangsters. She has called some out to their faces, and posts clips online. Her videos have been viewed 42m times. \nThis is dangerous. In the past year alone hitmen, probably in the pay of drug gangs like the pCC, have murdered a local mayor, a radio journalist, a former prison director and a prosecutor. Ms Gonz\u00e1lez and her family have received death threats. \u201cWe\u2019re a quasi-narcostate,\u201d she frets.\nWashington\u2019s sanctions are unlikely to hurt the ultraconservative Colorados\u2014in power for all but five years since 1947\u2014at the ballot box. Paraguayans grumble about venal politicians, but most have more pressing priorities. One in four lives in poverty; two-thirds hold informal jobs. Drought probably nudged the economy into recession in 2022. Equivalent to 13.9% of gDP, the government\u2019s tax take is South America\u2019s lowest; cancer hospitals have no medicines. Desperate, citizens are forced to rely on the Colorado Party\u2019s embrace.\nMr Cartes, for all his unpopularity in Washington, looks safe enough. In December the Colorado Party held internal elections. Mr Cartes was voted its leader in a landslide, and the party chose Santiago Pe\u00f1a, a former finance minister and his chosen candidate, to contest the presidential election in April.
