His face grins relentlessly over all corners of the country (pictured). \u201cPosters don\u2019t vote,\u201d quips a member of the campaign team for Peter Obi, the candidate of a rival minor party who unexpectedly leads the polls in what is usually a two-horse race.\nThe contest is close, chaotic and crucial to the future of Africa\u2019s most populous country and biggest economy. Nigerians, who will vote on February 25th, are poorer today than eight years ago. Much of the blame falls on the outgoing president, Muhammadu Buhari, who has governed badly during his eight years in office. Fully 89% of Nigerians think the country is heading in the wrong direction, according to Afrobarometer, a pollster. On his watch the economy has stagnated and violence has spread: last year at least 10,000 people were killed by criminal gangs, terrorists or the army. A country that once exported security through peacekeeping missions now exports trouble, destabilising neighbours. \nYet for all its travails, Nigeria is also Africa\u2019s biggest democracy\u2014with an opportunity for renewal. That matters in a country that has gone through five coups. The use of modern voting technology will make it harder to rig the results. More Nigerians are likely to vote than ever before. There is an \u201cunprecedented awakening\u201d among the young, who make up 40% of registered voters, says Opeyemi Oriniowo of the Nigeria Youth Futures Fund, an NGO based in Lagos, the commercial capital. These are telling signals in a continent where democracy is in retreat. Should an opposition party win, this would be only the second time since the generals returned to barracks in 1999 that voters have ejected an incumbent party by the ballot.\nThree hopefuls seem to have a shot at victory. To secure it they have to gain not only the most votes nationally, but also win at least 25% of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and federal capital. If no candidate clears that bar, there will be an unprecedented run-off. \nWhat will decide who wins? Despite the huge challenges facing Nigeria, it will not be policy proposals. Little distinguishes the candidates on the key issues; other factors come into play. Power-brokers often deliver blocks of votes by fair means or foul. \u201cWhoever the camp leaders say, that is who we will vote for,\u201d says Falmata Abdulrahman as she breastfeeds her daughter in a camp for displaced people in the north-east. Intimidation and vote-buying are common. \u201cWe were at the mercy of hoodlums and thugs,\u201d says Ahmadu Duste, who worked at a polling station in the last election. \u201cI saw voters being given cash.\u201d\nThe 70-year-old Mr Tinubu has the clearest path to victory because he has deep pockets and his APC controls 21 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 governorships. He expects to win handsomely in the south-west, his regional stronghold. He is hoping that his Muslim faith and that of his running-mate, Kashim Shettima, a former governor of the north-eastern state of Borno, will help him in the mostly Muslim north. Yet given the violence, fuel shortages and economic malaise in Nigeria, many voters may be wary of backing the incumbent party. Many also worry about Mr Tinubu\u2019s health, since he looks increasingly frail and has had to skip several big campaign events. \nAnd some may question his character. Last year he settled a lawsuit in which he was accused of secretly owning 70% of a private company that was given a contract to collect taxes on behalf of Lagos state during his time as its governor (1999-2007). Court papers alleged that it earned a commission of 10% of all revenues it collected there. Mr Tinubu denies any wrongdoing. \n\nSome voters also question the probity of the main opposition\u2019s candidate, 76-year-old Atiku Abubakar of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (pdp), a wealthy former customs official and vice-president. In 2010 a Senate committee in America said he was implicated in the transfer of over $40m of \u201csuspect funds\u201d to that country. He too denies wrongdoing. \n\nAcross much of Nigeria, religious leaders\u2014Christian and Muslim\u2014are pushing people to vote for their co-religionists. That may set an imposing hurdle for Mr Abubakar. He is a northerner and a Muslim representing a party that in recent years has found support mainly in the Christian south. This time Mr Obi, a Christian who is backed by neither of the two dominant parties of yore, will eat into much of that support. \u201cMy pastor encourages us to vote for him,\u201d says Lydia Adamu, a churchgoer. Mr Abubakar is struggling to rally even his own party. Five pdp governors have withheld their endorsements and seem set to back his southern rivals. And in the north he will probably lose votes to Rabiu Kwankwaso, a popular former governor who is also running for the top job. \nMr Obi, a 61-year-old former governor and trader, owes his popularity in part to citizens\u2019 desperation for an alternative to Nigeria\u2019s venal, ego-laden politicians. Many voters are attracted by his frugal, energetic style and see him as more honest than his rivals. Kayode Fayemi, a former APC governor advising Mr Tinubu\u2019s campaign, concedes that Mr Obi will probably take 80% to 90% of the vote in the south-east, his home region. Rivals deride his young fans as keyboard warriors who are not registered to vote. Yet as supporters hung off nearby balconies at a recent rally, Mr Obi cried, \u201cIf you have your PVC [voter card], raise your hand.\u201d A forest of arms rose to the sky. \nStill, Mr Obi\u2019s path to victory is a narrow one. Election officials are accused of dragging their heels in registering new voters, particularly in his stronghold, which has fewer voters on the books than other regions (see map). And his weakness in northern states means he may struggle to clear the 25% bar. His best hope is that urbanites turn out in such large numbers that the election goes to a run-off. \nThe poll seems unlikely to be completely free, fair and peaceful, but it should still deliver a legitimate result. Election offices have been repeatedly attacked. Polling booths will be largely absent from areas infested with jihadists. Losers may stir up violence. More worryingly, some talk of a return to Nigeria\u2019s dark past of coups, among them Mr Fayemi. Some powerful Nigerians \u201cwant to pre-empt the people\u201d, he says, because they \u201cfeel that none of the candidates in the running now would be good for the country.\u201d Thankfully, a putsch would be hard to pull off. Whatever the failings of the contenders, a return to military rule would be worse for Nigeria. \u25a0", "description": "Three candidates still have real hopes of victory", "ogDescription": "Three
