Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/28/can-europes-power-grid-cope-with-the-green-transition", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "\u201cMore Energiewende, more business for us,\u201d says Leonhard Birnbaum, chief executive of E.ON, a German power-grid operator that enjoys a near monopoly in Europe\u2019s biggest economy. The set of policies and timetables to which he is referring (and which translates to \u201cenergy turning-point\u201d) was first unveiled in 2000 with the aim of making Germany a net-zero emitter of carbon by 2045. It is meant to increase the demand for and the supply of green power exponentially. And it can only work so long as that power can reliably flow from wind and solar farms to users in Germany and the rest of Europe.\nThis presents an enormous opportunity for E.ON\u2014and an equally formidable challenge. The energy transition requires huge investments in German and European grids, and it requires them right now. That will only happen if the government and regulators fundamentally change the way they deal with power-grid projects, notably by cutting red tape and speeding up permitting for grid expansion and reinforcement. \u201cThe limits of infrastructure are the biggest obstacle of Europe\u2019s green transition,\u201d says Mr Birnbaum. At the moment, he explains, the grid expansion can barely cope with the huge surge of producers of renewable energy trying to connect to it.\nTo illustrate the scale of the task, Mr Birnbaum points out that one charging station for electric cars with 15 outlets needs as much power as a town of 5,000 inhabitants. A new data centre needs as much power as 80,000 households. As a result, electricity consumption in Europe is forecast to increase by around 60% by the end of the decade. And whereas before the Energiewende Europe had 200-300 power plants, in October E.ON expects the millionth electricity generator to hook up to its German grid. \n\u201cThe challenges of the energy transition make Mr Birnbaum one of Germany\u2019s most political chief executives, along with Markus Krebber,\u201d says Ingo Speich of Deka, an investment fund that owns 1% of e.ON. Mr Krebber runs rwe, a big German power producer (and E.ON\u2019s largest shareholder, with a 15% stake). Mr Birnbaum admits he still \u201ctoo often\u201d finds himself in Berlin, a six-hour drive away from E.ON\u2019s headquarters in Essen, talking to policymakers. But at least the coalition government is listening to his concerns, he reports. \nPolicymakers in Brussels are on the case, too\u2014at least on paper. Earlier this month Kadri Simson, the EU\u2019s energy commissioner, lamented in the Financial Times that securing permits for grid reinforcements can take up to ten years in Europe. Without certainty about connection to the grid, she warned, renewables projects were being abandoned. Existing clean-power capacity is underutilised. Solar panels, for instance, are frequently switched off when grids are overloaded, because they are flexible and easy to manage. \u201cThis is wasteful and costly,\u201d Ms Simson wrote.\nWhile Mr Birnbaum waits for German and EU regulators to untangle the bureaucracy\u2014a process that, he complains, remains far too selective\u2014his company is starting to ramp up investments. These will add up to \u20ac33bn ($35bn) over the next five years, up from an earlier plan to spend \u20ac20bn. Most of that will go to its grids, which account for 72% of E.ON\u2019s turnover. \nAmong other things, each year Mr Birnbaum is planning to replace between 6,000 and 7,000 of the company\u2019s 100,000 or so analogue transformers, which convert high-voltage power from the grid to voltages needed in homes, with advanced models that monitor performance and detect faults before they occur. Mr Birnbaum is keen on software that can strengthen networks without extra physical infrastructure by optimising the management of solar and wind power\u2019s variable output. \u201cA bigger system with much more renewable energy can only be run digitally,\u201d says Mr Birnbaum. He calls such \u201csmart grids\u201d the basis of 21st-century society. \nAfter a difficult 2022, when investors fretted about the impact of the energy crisis caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, E.ON\u2019s share price has rallied by nearly 20% this year. That has given Mr Birnbaum some room for manoeuvre. But if \u20ac584bn-worth of grid investments is to materialise by 2030, which Ms Simson estimates is necessary to meet the EU\u2019s climate goals, he will need a lot more of it. This means more visits to Berlin and Brussels. \u25a0\nFor more coverage of climate change, sign up for the Climate Issue, our fortnightly subscriber-only newsletter, or visit our climate-change
