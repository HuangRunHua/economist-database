"Hollywood\u2019s striking film and television screenwriters returned to work after their union, the Writers Guild of America, reached a tentative agreement with entertainment companies. They had been on strike since May 2nd. The deal with the studios includes bonuses for writers based on viewing figures on streaming services, and guarantees that artificial intelligence can\u2019t write or rewrite literary material or be used as a source. It is hoped that the pact will entice actors to end their strike. The industrial action has already delayed the release of many movies next year, including a Lord of the Rings prequel. \nA legal-package delivery\nAmerica\u2019s Federal Trade Commission lodged a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the online retailer of using \u201cunfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power\u201d. The FTC claims Amazon does this by burying sellers on its site that offer cheaper goods elsewhere and by replacing relevant search results with paid ads, among other things. Amazon said the lawsuit was \u201cmisguided\u201d and a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding of retail\u201d. \nMeanwhile, Amazon boosted the other, more profitable, side of its business, when it struck a deal to invest up to $4bn in Anthropic, an AI  startup. Amazon also announced that it will start introducing ads to its Prime Video content from next year. As with other streaming services, users will be able to sign up for a costlier ad-free subscription. \nAlibaba said it would list its logistics arm, Cainiao, in an IPO in Hong Kong, the first spin-off in a restructuring plan that will split the Chinese tech giant into six entities. Alibaba will still own more than 50% of Cainiao after its flotation. \nMicrosoft\u2019s takeover of Activision Blizzard came a step closer, after Britain\u2019s competition regulator dropped its opposition to the deal. Microsoft had submitted a revised offer for the video-game maker that attended to the regulator\u2019s concerns. \nEvergrande missed another debt payment on a bond, casting more doubt about the future of the embattled Chinese property developer. Hui Ka Yan, Evergrande\u2019s chairman, has reportedly been put under surveillance by the police, a move that stops just short of an arrest or detention. Trading in Evergrande\u2019s shares was suspended in Hong Kong. \nThe International Energy Agency said that \u201cbolder action\u201d was required if the world was to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The agency said that global renewable-energy capacity needed to triple by 2030 and sales of electric cars and heat pumps would have to rise sharply.\nTurkey\u2019s finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, asked markets to be patient with the government\u2019s efforts to rebalance the economy after years of unorthodox economic polices. The central bank recently raised its key interest rate from 25% to 30%, the fourth consecutive increase, as it tries to tackle the resurgence of sky-high inflation. \nWorld trade volumes were 3.2% lower in July than a year earlier, according to a closely watched index from the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. That is the sharpest decline since August 2020, amid the pandemic, and driven to a large extent by the slowdown in China and the knock-on effects to trade in Asia. \nA big act to follow\n\nLachlan Murdoch started to put his stamp on Fox Corporation, nominating Tony Abbott, a former Australian prime minister and climate-change sceptic, to the board. This came soon after Rupert Murdoch announced that he was stepping down as chairman of both Fox and News Corporation, giving his son complete control over the businesses.
