"https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/28/could-britains-liberal-democrats-matter-again", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "LIFE IS HARD when you are merely Britain\u2019s fourth-biggest political party. Third place\u2014which the Liberal Democrats held until 2015\u2014at least guarantees some exposure: regular slots at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions and on the airwaves. Fourth, stuck behind even the Scottish National Party, means obscurity. \u201cCalls from the BBC\u201d dry up, laments Sarah Olney, whom even political nerds struggle to name as the party\u2019s finance spokesperson. Half of Britons have never heard of its leader, Sir Ed Davey. \nCould that soon change? At the election in 2019 the Lib Dems scooped up a measly 11 seats, down from a peak of 62 in 2005. But things have started to improve of late. The party has won four by-elections, overturning large Conservative majorities in each constituency. At the party\u2019s conference in Bournemouth on September 26th, Sir Ed talked valiantly of smashing the Blue Wall \u201cfor good\u201d at the next general election, almost certainly next year.\nThe wilderness years were, in effect, self-inflicted. The party joined a coalition with the Conservatives, and then was punished by voters who were fed up with its embrace of the government\u2019s austerity programme and furious that it reneged on election pledges, notably one not to raise university tuition fees. The choppy waters of Brexit proved hard to navigate; three leaders departed in as many years. \nHaving helped cause the Lib Dems\u2019 woes, the Conservatives offered them a route back. Brexit, chaotic government and sloppy behaviour all estranged voters from the Tories. Sensibly, Sir Ed wants to take advantage. He says little about the European Union, to the chagrin of his ardently Europhile members. His campaign will instead focus on the cost of living, the NHS and sewage. The last is already a pungent issue in leafy areas. \nThree of the recent by-election victories were in the west of England, the party\u2019s heartland. But success in Chesham and Amersham, a commuter seat near London, has excited hopes of winning in suburban, professional areas. Mark Pack, the party\u2019s president, suggests a focus on places with \u201cbig houses and bigger potholes\u201d, where even affluent voters cannot swerve the effects of crumbling services. Rob Ford of Manchester University thinks the party could do well among graduates in seats around London.\nThe party leadership used the conference to prepare for the campaign, nixing a plan to put a penny on income tax that might have deterred Tory voters. In the conference hall young activists blocked an attempt to drop a national housing target. At the conference bar (mostly older) members grumbled about excessive caution on Europe. Yet the party\u2019s strategy of targeting rich Conservative seats is almost certainly the right one.\nIf Labour were to fall short of a majority, would Sir Ed contemplate joining another coalition? He won\u2019t say. Many Lib Dems would prefer to shape the next Parliament in a lower-risk way, either as an outright opposition party, or via ad-hoc support for those in office. A good outcome could prove to be a small majority for Labour. That could leave the party with considerable influence to temper some of Labour\u2019s less liberal instincts and to push for its own ambitions.\nThe holy grail would be electoral reform. Some unions and Labour members are keen but the leadership is opposed, and unlikely to change its stance unless forced. Lib Dems still grouch about Tony Blair breaking a pledge to hold a referendum on the issue after winning a landslide at the 1997 election. Crucially, though, the Lib Dems hope to enjoy attention again, ideally from their traditional, unglamorous perch in third place. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain,
