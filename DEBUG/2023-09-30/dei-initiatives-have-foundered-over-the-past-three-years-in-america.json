"Lofty goals are admirable in any organisation; just don\u2019t forget the deliverables. Ibram X. Kendi managed the first part in pledging to \u201csolve seemingly intractable racial problems of our time\u201d when Boston University (BU) hired him in 2020. The scholar-activist\u2014who says that racial disparities result from racist policies, and that a policy is racist if it yields racial disparities\u2014was given the mandate and money to build an academic centre. He promised degree programmes, racial-justice training modules and more. But with a piddling output, despite having raised nearly $55m, his Centre for Antiracist Research has sacked about half its 40-odd staff and said it will scale back. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know where the money is,\u201d said Saida Grundy, a sociology professor at BU who briefly worked for the centre, to the Boston Globe. The university is investigating the centre\u2019s use of grant money and \u201cmanagement culture\u201d. Even those who once supported Mr Kendi\u2019s hiring now see the enterprise as posturing flim-flam on the part of BU. \u201cWe marched for change and what did we get? Murals, right? The centre is the equivalent of a mural,\u201d says Phillipe Copeland, a professor of social work at BU who was at the centre for two years. \nThe dust-up comes amid a re-evaluation of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in higher education, which exploded during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and after George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020. One push involved hiring more administrators focused on diversity. In 2021 the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, found that 65 universities representing 16% of four-year students employed 3.4 DEI staff for every 100 tenured faculty. Many also started requiring tenure candidates to submit statements describing their commitment to DEI.\nSince Joe Biden\u2019s election, Democrats have been less focused on racial injustice. Meanwhile, self-styled anti-woke politicians have pushed back. In May Ron DeSantis, Florida\u2019s Republican governor, approved a law barring public universities in the state from funding DEI programmes with government money. Miffed students, he said, should \u201cgo to Berkeley\u201d. In June his counterpart in Texas banned public universities there from requiring DEI statements. The public-university systems in Missouri, North Carolina and Wisconsin have taken similar action. \u201cIn states where the rollback has happened, there\u2019s been pressure from politicians to confront the excesses of DEI policies,\u201d says John Sailer of the National Association of Scholars, a conservative advocacy group.\nCompanies are also facing pushback over their DEI initiatives, which range from hiring targets to mentorship schemes for minority employees. Though the Supreme Court\u2019s ban on affirmative action in June applied only to university admissions, conservative lawyers hope their challenges to such policies in the workplace will get a sympathetic hearing too. An outfit founded by Stephen Miller, who previously worked for the Trump administration, has asked the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to investigate more than a dozen big firms for \u201cpolicies that punish Americans for being white, Asian or male\u201d. Edward Blum, who brought the affirmative-action case, is suing law firms over their recruitment programmes.\nOffering, say, leadership training exclusively to minorities may be riskier after the Supreme Court ruling, but companies should be able to defend themselves if they make those opportunities available to everyone in other contexts, reckons Joan Williams of UC Law San Francisco. And under current law federal contractors\u2014which include many large companies\u2014are actually required to take steps to improve the diversity of their workforce. \nSome firms may pare back DEI programmes to avoid being sued. But for others, playing up DEI efforts is good business\u2014even if it does not actually yield more diversity. A working paper by Edward Watts of Yale and his colleagues found a large and growing number of \u201cdiversity washers\u201d: listed firms that make hay of their DEI commitments in financial filings despite not having many diverse employees. They got more money from funds geared towards environmental, social and governance investing.\u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.
