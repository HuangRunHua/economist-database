"keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/09/28/dave-portnoy-an-internet-personality-has-become-pizzas-kingmaker", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "He has a mansion in Florida and millions of Twitter followers. He rails against Dr Fauci, the White House\u2019s former chief medical adviser, on Fox News and has been accused of misogyny and sexual misconduct, which he denies. Dave Portnoy (pictured) has crafted his persona in the image of the former president. He even calls himself \u201cel presidente\u201d. \nBarstool Sports, the media company Mr Portnoy founded 20 years ago, made him rich, but his \u201cOne Bite\u201d pizza reviews, viewed nearly 700m times on YouTube, have made him the unlikely kingmaker of American pizza. On September 23rd, in drenching rains at a minor-league baseball stadium on Coney Island, he held his One Bite Pizza Festival. Around 6,000 fans attended; tickets started at $150.\nMr Portnoy does not pretend to be \u201csome elite, like, food guy\u201d, he told journalists. In more than 1,000 videos, he does not review so much as react. \u201cOne bite, everyone knows the rules,\u201d he tells the camera before gobbling down a plain-cheese slice, which he rates from one to ten. Mr Portnoy is not afraid to be feisty, as shown by a recent spat with a pizzeria owner in Massachusetts that went viral. (The offending pizzeria was then flooded with negative reviews by \u201cstoolies\u201d, Mr Portnoy\u2019s fans.) \nDespite the laddishness, this is serious business. A rare high score\u2014only 21 pizzerias in the country have scored a nine or above\u2014can guarantee a steady, if rowdy and mostly male, clientele. Even for a popular establishment like John\u2019s of Bleecker Street in Manhattan (one of Mr Portnoy\u2019s avowed favourites, rated 9.3), a good review from him \u201cputs you on the next level\u201d, says Kevin Jackson, the manager. A small pizzeria in New Jersey lucky enough to receive a 9.4 quickly sold out its entire menu.\nWith cartoon renderings of Mr Portnoy\u2019s bearded face smiling from every surface and an inflatable Statue of Liberty (brandishing a slice instead of a torch) presiding, the festival was a cheesy cross between a music festival, a drunken tailgate and a Trump rally. Despite the whiff of culture war\u2014with several rants about the media\u2014the event offered a helpful education in New York pizza. Mr Portnoy\u2019s highest-rated pizzas tend to be thin, crispy, slightly charred and heavy on cheese. This is in keeping with classic ideals of pizza by the slice, says Scott Wiener, a pizza \u201ctour guide\u201d and critic of Mr Portnoy\u2019s showmanship. The best slices have a thin crust with a \u201cslightly puffy rim\u201d and tomato sauce with light seasoning, if any. \nPatsy\u2019s, a pizzeria in Harlem founded in 1933, claims to have been the first to sell pizza by the slice in New York. Mr Portnoy awarded the storied restaurant, which was present at the festival, an 8.6. But over the years New York pizza has become as diverse as the city, and your correspondent, who intrepidly sampled 15 of the 35 pizzerias, enjoyed less predictable fare. This included samples by two based in Brooklyn: Di Fara\u2019s almost cracker-like crust and an exquisite offering by Lucali, whose crust straddled the crispier New York and chewier Neapolitan styles. (Lucali mixed mozzarella and parmesan and added a piquant garnish of basil.)\n\u201cThe beauty of pizza is that everybody has access to it,\u201d says Mr Wiener. Perhaps, then, the advent of a pizza populist\u2014a bite-sized Trump, whose coarse charisma is impossible for restaurants to ignore\u2014should not be surprising. Even if Mr Portnoy, like American culture writ large, is short on decency, he is  a good guide to a great pie. \u25a0\nRead more from World in a dish, our column on food:\nChinese food is more diverse
