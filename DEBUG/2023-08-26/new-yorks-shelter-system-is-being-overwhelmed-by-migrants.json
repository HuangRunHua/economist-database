parking lot of Creedmoor Psychiatric Centre in Queens is far from ideal. The neighbourhood, 15 miles (24km) outside Manhattan, is mostly residential and is served by a solitary bus line. But because of the influx of migrants the tents are badly needed. It opened on August 15th and within a week the 1,000-bed facility was nearly full. Another shelter site, on Randall\u2019s Island, between Manhattan and Queens, along with one soon to open at Floyd Bennett Field, a helicopter base in Brooklyn, will add 5,500 beds for migrants. \nOver 110,000 people are housed in New York City\u2019s homeless shelter system. Of those, 53% are asylum seekers. For over a year they have arrived in the Big Apple on buses, shipped by Texan politicians, or of their own accord, coming by plane, train, car and bus. In the week ending on August 20th, 3,100 arrived. New York\u2019s \u201cright to shelter\u201d mandate, in place since a lawsuit was settled in 1981, means that anyone without a roof to sleep under is entitled to one from the city.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been forced to play an unsustainable game of \u2018whack-a-mole\u2019, opening site after site as asylum seekers continue to arrive by the thousands,\u201d said Eric Adams, the city\u2019s mayor, on August 21st. Earlier this month many people were forced to sleep for days on the pavement outside the Roosevelt Hotel, the city\u2019s largest intake centre. Mr Adams says there is \u201cno more room\u201d. The state attorney-general is looking into allegations that DocGo, a medical services provider hired by the city, mishandled migrants in its care. \nHousing huddled masses is not cheap. It will cost $4bn a year over three years: about 6% of what the city takes in tax, or roughly equivalent to the combined spending on the city\u2019s fire and sanitation departments. Sheltering a single family costs around $380 a night, says Murad Awawdeh, of the New York Immigration Coalition, a refugees\u2019 rights organisation. Renting an apartment costs a fifth of that.\nNew York City is unique in having assumed this obligation. Other cities, like Chicago and Philadelphia, are also struggling to help migrants, but neither has a legal requirement to house them (or the staggering numbers New York does). Only Massachusetts has anything remotely similar. It, too, is seeing an influx of arrivals; its governor has declared a state of emergency. \nSome migrants have been bussed to the suburbs on the city\u2019s dime. But Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York state, is not a fan of moving migrants around. \u201cPutting someone in a hotel on a dark, lonely road in upstate New York and telling them they\u2019re supposed to survive is not compassion,\u201d she said on August 16th. The state has directed $1.5bn to the city to help. But it has not budged otherwise. On August 23rd state and city lawyers gathered behind closed doors with a judge and the Legal Aid Society, a charity, to try to hash out a deal, but produced nothing.\nNew York has always been a gateway to America. But in the past the government did little beyond lifting the lamp beside the golden door to the tired and poor. Migrants were expected to find their own way, and mostly did, through family and kinship ties. The arrivals now tend not to have such links. Most are from Venezuela, but people get to America from as far afield as Russia and West Africa. One Mauritanian, who is staying in a suburban hotel paid for by New York City, says his family sold their livestock to pay for his travel costs. Most migrants would love to work, but it takes months for work permits to be issued.\nMr Adams has begged White House officials to expedite work permits. Stopping people from working is \u201canti-American\u201d, he says. But the federal government is not going to change the asylum system quickly, if at all. Nor is the right to shelter likely to go away\u2014and even if it did, the city is hardly going to start dumping people on the streets. \u201cNew York City would look like the West Coast cities with a lot more street homelessness,\u201d says Kathryn Kliff, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society, a charity. Something needs to change though. More migrants arrive every day. The mayor will have to get more inventive. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and
