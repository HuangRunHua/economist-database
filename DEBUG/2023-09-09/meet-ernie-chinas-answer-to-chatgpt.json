Although four other firms, including SenseTime, a facial-recognition business, launched similar services on the same day, and six others have been granted approval by China\u2019s government, Ernie is generating the most buzz.\nLast month Robin Li, Baidu\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, said that the roll-out of AI had been a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d for the company. That shift did not, however, happen overnight. Years of investment have turned Baidu into one of China\u2019s most sophisticated AI companies, with a system that encompasses chip design, a deep-learning framework, and proprietary AI models and applications. The company started building Ernie in 2019, making it one of the earliest firms anywhere to experiment with such \u201cgenerative\u201d AI.\nSo far Baidu has shied away from giving explicit guidance on what the technology will mean for its bottom line, but analysts believe Ernie will drive more traffic to its search engine and other services, raising advertising revenues. Baidu has also cemented itself as China\u2019s largest AI cloud provider, and has started offering bespoke services for companies that want AI models tailored to their specific needs.\nEnthusiasm for Baidu\u2019s other important foray into AI, an autonomous-taxi business, is more muted. The service has been launched in a few cities across China, allowing users to hail robotaxis via a mobile app. But trips must still be monitored remotely, and a wider roll-out could be years away. Few analysts expect the unit to generate meaningful profits soon.\nMuch of what comes next for Baidu will depend on policymaking in Beijing and Washington. Restrictions on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China imposed by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration are causing the company a world of pain. Almost all of those chips, which most AI builders use to train their models, are produced outside China. Using a larger quantity of lower-powered processors is possible, but expensive. \nIn Baidu\u2019s case, its AI efforts rely on the Kunlunxin chip. Although it designed the chip itself, production is outsourced to companies like TSMC, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer. America\u2019s restrictions put limits on the types of chip that foreign foundries can sell to Chinese firms, and no domestic supplier has been able to produce such advanced components. Since America\u2019s restrictions were announced, Baidu has been downplaying the importance of the Kunlunxins, which may hint that it is having problems procuring them. \nChina is trying to catch up in the manufacture of advanced chips. On August 29th Huawei, a maker of telecoms-gear clobbered by American sanctions, began selling a 5G smartphone that, after being dismantled by analysts, appeared to contain unexpectedly advanced Chinese-made silicon (albeit not quite cutting-edge). \nXi\u2019s laws of robotics\nThat still leaves obstacles closer to home. China\u2019s government has taken a keen interest in the regulation of AI, moving faster than most other countries. This has yet to cause too much consternation among the country\u2019s tech executives. Regulators recognise the commercial value of AI and want companies to make money from it, says one executive. They also grasp the importance of allowing Chinese companies to compete at the global level, the person says. The approval of the first batch of bots was quicker than some had feared. Long delays to product launches, such as those for new video games, often hurt the share prices of their Chinese makers.\nYet many AI enthusiasts still find some rules onerous, especially for a nascent industry. Companies offering generative-AI services are required to identify and report \u201cillegal content\u201d. They must also adhere to China\u2019s \u201ccore socialist values\u201d, a sweeping and ambiguous command. After netizens spotted that a prompt for a \u201cpatriotic cat\u201d in Ernie\u2019s drawing application produced a picture of a feline with an American flag, the words \u201cpatriotism\u201d and \u201cpatriotic cat\u201d were blocked in the tool. Users may be put off by what Chinese AI cannot say, or fearful of being reported for asking the wrong questions. The costs of censorship and compliance will start to add up for Baidu and other companies, warns Kai Wang of Morningstar, a research firm.\nRecent experience has made it clear to China\u2019s tech executives that they operate at the pleasure of the government, and that its favour can be quickly withdrawn. Internet companies were hit with several regulatory crackdowns between 2020 and 2022. Another such assault on AI could do great damage to the firms that have invested in the technology, Baidu foremost among them. The company is testing the waters in a difficult environment. For that reason it is important to watch what Ernie says\u2014and all that it doesn\u2019t. \u25a0\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our

\u2013 Meet Ernie, China\u2019s answer to ChatGPT", "headline": "Meet Ernie, China\u2019s answer to ChatGPT", "section": "Business", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/03/meet-ernie-chinas-answer-to-chatgpt", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Ernie Bot has some controversial views on science. China\u2019s leading artificial-intelligence (AI) chatbot, which was released to the public on August 31st, reckons that covid-19 originated among American vape users in July 2019; later that year the virus was spread to the Chinese city of Wuhan, via American lobsters. On matters of politics, by contrast, the chatbot is rather quiet. Ernie is confused by questions such as \u201cWho is China\u2019s president?\u201d and will tell you the name of Xi Jinping\u2019s mother, but not those of his siblings. It draws a blank if asked about the drawbacks of socialism. It often attempts to redirect sensitive conversations by saying: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d\nErnie\u2019s reticence will come as no shock to Chinese users familiar with a heavily censored internet. They may be more surprised by the chatbot\u2019s origins. For Ernie is the brainchild of Baidu, a Chinese tech giant that has for years been outshone by rivals. Now, thanks to ai, the company is staging a comeback. The extent to which it succeeds will say much about the prospects for the Chinese technology industry, which is squeezed on one side by America\u2019s export controls and on the other by Mr Xi\u2019s increasing authoritarianism. \nA decade ago Baidu, as the operator of China\u2019s largest search engine, was at the centre of the country\u2019s internet. Together with Alibaba and Tencent, China\u2019s two most valuable internet businesses, it formed a triumvirate known as \u201cBAT\u201d. With foreign search engines banned or heavily censored in China, it faced little competition in its core business. \n\nBaidu never lost its dominance of Chinese search; it still enjoys more than 90% of search traffic in the country. Yet shifts in the technology landscape have left the company a shadow of its former self. Most Chinese internet users now trawl the web with the help of super-apps such as Tencent\u2019s WeChat. Advertising dollars have shifted to apps like Douyin, the Chinese cousin of TikTok. Meituan, a delivery platform, and Pinduoduo, an e-commerce firm, have surged past Baidu\u2019s market value of $50bn. In an effort at emulation, it launched its own delivery and shopping offerings, along with other services such as payments and social media. These mostly flopped. The company\u2019s market capitalisation is now equivalent to one-eighth of Tencent\u2019s, down from one-fifth five years ago (see chart).\nBaidu\u2019s rollout of AI, however, is reigniting excitement about the company. Ernie was downloaded 1m times within 19 hours of its release (ChatGPT reached 1m downloads after five days, according to its American maker, OpenAI). Baidu\u2019s share price rallied by more than 4% on the day of release, as analysts, investors and common folk bombarded the bot with questions. Although four other firms, including SenseTime, a facial-recognition business, launched similar services on the same day, and six others have been granted approval by China\u2019s government, Ernie is generating the most buzz.\nLast month Robin Li, Baidu\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, said that the roll-out of AI had been a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d for the company. That shift did not, however, happen overnight. Years of investment have turned Baidu into one of China\u2019s most sophisticated AI companies, with a system that encompasses chip design, a deep-learning framework, and proprietary AI models and applications. The company started building Ernie in 2019, making it one of the earliest firms anywhere to experiment with such \u201cgenerative\u201d AI.\nSo far Baidu has shied away from giving explicit guidance on what the technology will mean for its bottom line, but analysts believe Ernie will drive more traffic to its search engine and other services, raising advertising revenues. Baidu has also cemented itself as China\u2019s largest AI cloud provider, and has started offering bespoke services for companies that want AI models tailored to their specific needs.\nEnthusiasm for Baidu\u2019s other important foray into AI, an autonomous-taxi business, is more muted. The service has been launched in a few cities across China, allowing users to hail robotaxis via a mobile app. But trips must still be monitored remotely, and a wider roll-out could be years away. Few analysts expect the unit to generate meaningful profits soon.\nMuch of what comes next for Baidu will depend on policymaking in Beijing and Washington. Restrictions on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China imposed by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration are causing the company a world of pain. Almost all of those chips, which most AI builders use to train their models, are produced outside China. Using a larger quantity of lower-powered processors is possible, but expensive. \nIn Baidu\u2019s case, its AI efforts rely on the Kunlunxin chip. Although it designed the chip itself, production is outsourced to companies like TSMC, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer. America\u2019s restrictions put limits on the types of chip that foreign foundries can sell to Chinese firms, and no domestic supplier has been able to produce such advanced components. Since America\u2019s restrictions were announced, Baidu has been downplaying the importance of the Kunlunxins, which may hint that it is having problems procuring them. \nChina is trying to catch up in the manufacture of advanced chips. On August 29th Huawei, a maker of telecoms-gear clobbered by American sanctions, began selling a 5G smartphone that, after being dismantled by analysts, appeared to contain unexpectedly advanced Chinese-made silicon (albeit not quite cutting-edge). \nXi\u2019s laws of robotics\nThat still leaves obstacles closer to home. China\u2019s government has taken a keen interest in the regulation of AI, moving faster than most other countries. This has yet to cause too much consternation among the country\u2019s tech executives. Regulators recognise the commercial value of AI and want companies to make money from it, says one executive. They also grasp the importance of allowing Chinese companies to compete at the global level, the person says. The approval of the first batch of bots was quicker than some had feared. Long delays to product launches, such as those for new video games, often hurt the share prices of their Chinese makers.\nYet many AI enthusiasts still find some rules onerous, especially for a nascent industry. Companies offering generative-AI services are required to identify and report \u201cillegal content\u201d. They must also adhere to China\u2019s \u201ccore socialist values\u201d, a sweeping and ambiguous command. After netizens spotted that a prompt for a \u201cpatriotic cat\u201d in Ernie\u2019s drawing application produced a picture of a feline with an American flag, the words \u201cpatriotism\u201d and \u201cpatriotic cat\u201d were blocked in the tool. Users may be put off by what Chinese AI cannot say, or fearful of being reported for asking the wrong questions. The costs of censorship and compliance will start to add up for Baidu and other companies, warns Kai Wang of Morningstar, a research firm.\nRecent experience has made it clear to China\u2019s tech executives that they operate at the pleasure of the government, and that its favour can be quickly withdrawn. Internet companies were hit with several regulatory crackdowns between 2020 and 2022. Another such assault on AI could do great damage to the firms that have invested in the technology, Baidu foremost among them. The company is testing the waters in a difficult environment. For that reason it is important to watch what Ernie says\u2014and all that it doesn\u2019t. \u25a0\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our
