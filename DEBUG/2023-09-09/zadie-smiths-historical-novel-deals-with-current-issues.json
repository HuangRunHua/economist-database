By Zadie Smith. Penguin Press; 464 pages; $29. Hamish Hamilton; \u00a320\nZadie Smith, who has just written a historical novel, never planned to. She saw the genre as \u201cby nature a conservative form\u201d, guided by nostalgia for a time rather unlike the multicultural world of her life and books. \nWhen she burst onto the scene at 24 with \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d, her bestselling debut published in 2000, Ms Smith earned comparisons to Charles Dickens; she cluttered a multigenerational epic about immigrants in London with wry details and antic plot twists. As she has morphed from wunderkind into literary luminary, she has experimented widely with styles and forms, nodding to E.M. Forster in \u201cOn Beauty\u201d and to Virginia Woolf in \u201cNW\u201d. \nGiven her catholic taste in fiction, perhaps it was only a matter of time before she would write a historical novel after all. Her sixth novel, \u201cThe Fraud\u201d, is based on a real court battle in 1873, in which a seemingly uneducated butcher from east London claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne, the presumed-drowned heir to a grand estate. Ms Smith was fascinated by how this butcher\u2019s claim became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, with masses of Britons rooting for a self-declared aristocrat as if he was one of their own. \nLike most novels about the past, this one comments on the present. In short, pacey chapters, Ms Smith uses the trials\u2014which lasted years, making them among the longest in Britain\u2019s history\u2014to interrogate the odd populist appeal of elite men like Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, born into privilege yet praised for speaking for the common man. \u201cEverywhere he speaks there\u2019s huge crowds, full of those what are despised like him, and forgotten like him\u201d, says an illiterate former maid of the man pretending to be Sir Roger. \u201cHe\u2019s for us, and we\u2019re for him.\u201d \nMs Smith broadens the story to touch on her usual themes of race, class, identity and things that people cannot escape, like their bodies and circumstances. The reader\u2019s witness for the legal saga is the sharp-eyed Eliza Touchet, who became a widow in her 20s. Curious, sceptical and jaundiced, Touchet is shocked by the rowdy support for the man purporting to be Sir Roger\u2014\u201cSo obviously out of his depth, caught in an ever-widening lie\u201d\u2014but riveted by the quiet dignity of Andrew Bogle, a former Jamaican slave and Tichborne servant, who testifies on Tichborne\u2019s behalf. \n\u201cThe Fraud\u201d leaps from stuffy English parlours to Jamaican sugar plantations, where African slaves lost their names, their loves and often their lives while toiling for the British. The effect is potent, as Ms Smith\u2014a child of a white father and Jamaican mother\u2014considers a worse fraud than a butcher\u2019s claim to wealth. Beneath the sweetened tea of polite society was a hellscape of inhumanity. \nMs Smith admits that much of her career has involved injecting mixed-race people like herself into the novels she grew up with: \u201cThe older I get, the Freudian part of it is very clear to me, going through the canon and inserting myself,\u201d she says. With \u201cThe Fraud\u201d, she reveals the slavery stories that roiled unseen beneath the classic English novels of Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy and others. In other words, Ms Smith uses fiction to examine the fictions people tell themselves about history, including glossing over past misdeeds. \n\u201cSo much of life is delusion,\u201d Touchet observes. Her concerns about the gifts and thefts of time feel like the observations of a female writer in middle age. Her fascinating contradictions\u2014Touchet is at once self-aware and oblivious, right-minded and hypocritical\u2014make her a fine guide for exploring the mysteries that lurk between people, within nations and within the self. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter", "description": "What is the
