Though he declined an invitation to testify to senators on the matter, Chief Justice John Roberts sent a letter to Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including a \u201cStatement on Ethics Principles and Practices\u201d which all the justices agreed to. The commitment is weaker than a full code of conduct\u2014something Justice Elena Kagan said was in the works back in 2019\u2014but it is something. \nFor Richard Re, a law professor at the University of Virginia, tighter congressional regulation presents an opportunity for the justices to \u201cincrease their public legitimacy\u201d by fully laying out their financial ties and gifts. He thinks Mr Whitehouse\u2019s bill may be too focused on rules for when justices must recuse themselves, and is ambiguous on how (or whether) it will be enforced, but is \u201cgood food for thought\u201d. The bill has little chance of making it through a divided Congress. \nStill, \u201cgetting a bit of pushback from elected officials is all to the good\u201d, says Dan Epps, who teaches law at Washington University in St Louis. He reckons that it reminds the justices that \u201cthey\u2019re not above the law and that they still work for us\u201d. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Coming cleaner", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "United States"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/h4j4itd8schld2m55dnrjg1ro8nlttoc", "tegID": "h4j4itd8schld2m55dnrjg1ro8nlttoc", "headline": "United States", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/07/americas-school-day-starts-too-early-thats-starting-to-change", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/55nj036itd2165l43aife7ca71lplpa2", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "America\u2019s school day starts too early.

America\u2019s Supreme Court police itself?", "headline": "Can America\u2019s Supreme Court police itself?", "section": "United States", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/07/can-americas-supreme-court-police-itself", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "OTHER THAN receiving the occasional desk ornament or \u201ccoffee and doughnuts\u201d, federal employees in America are barred from accepting gifts worth more than $20 from anyone but friends and family. They must refuse all gifts that \u201cwould not have been given had the employee not held the status, authority or duties\u201d of his position. They are advised to consider declining even gifts valued at less than $20 that might prompt a reasonable person to \u201cquestion the employee\u2019s integrity or impartiality\u201d. Similar strictures to promote public confidence apply to employees of the judicial branch, including all district and circuit-court judges. \nBut they do not constrain the nine justices of the Supreme Court. The only ethical requirements that apply to America\u2019s nine most powerful jurists are found in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, an anti-corruption law passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The law requires public officials to disclose in an annual report certain information about their investments, outside income (currently capped at $30,000 a year for teaching, but unlimited when it comes to books) and gifts. It also requires some financial data related to the justices\u2019 immediate family.\nIn June ProPublica, an investigative outlet, reported that in 2008 Justice Samuel Alito omitted to log a trip on a private jet to Alaska that was paid for by a billionaire Republican donor who would later bring cases to the Supreme Court. In April ProPublica published details that Harlan Crow, a billionaire property developer, collector of memorabilia and noted donor to conservative causes, had been hosting Justice Clarence Thomas on his plane and yacht for decades. The website later reported that Mr Crow bought a home Justice Thomas owned in Georgia and paid private-school tuition for his great-nephew. \nThe New York Times found that in 1999 another friend gave Justice Thomas a loan to finance his purchase of a $267,230 RV, which he affectionately calls his land yacht. The court\u2019s longest-serving and most conservative justice reported none of this in years of financial disclosures\u2014though on five occasions earlier in his tenure he had reported travel on private jets. \nOn August 31st, in a belated disclosure report for 2022, Justice Thomas declared some of these gifts. He reported flying on Mr Crow\u2019s private jet three times last year\u2014in February, because of an \u201cunexpected ice storm\u201d in Texas; in May, due to the \u201cincreased security risk following the Dobbs opinion leak\u201d that erased the federal right to abortion; and in July for a holiday at Mr Crow\u2019s getaway in the Adirondacks. \nJustice Thomas also acknowledged inadvertently omitting other financial information from previous disclosures. He has now put on record his sale to Mr Crow in 2014 of the home where his 94-year-old mother continues to live. And he has noted his wife Ginni\u2019s life insurance, which he left off reports covering 2017 through 2021. In 2011 Justice Thomas filed similar corrections following his failure to report $686,589 that Mrs Thomas, a conservative activist, received from work at the Heritage Foundation, a like-minded think-tank.\nJustice Thomas has generally ignored raised eyebrows about his wife\u2019s activism. He did not recuse himself from a case involving the riot of January 6th 2021 at the Capitol, despite Mrs Thomas\u2019s active involvement in attempts to overturn Donald Trump\u2019s loss. Among the pleas she texted to Mark Meadows, Mr Trump\u2019s chief of staff, was her view that the \u201cBiden crime family & ballot fraud co-conspirators\u201d should be \u201cliving in barges off GITMO\u201d. \nThe uptick in financial transparency reflected in Justice Thomas\u2019s most recent report is \u201ca positive development\u201d in the eyes of Gabe Roth, head of Fix the Court, a watchdog. But Mr Roth laments that it took a \u201cmajor months-long scandal\u201d for him \u201cto follow the disclosure law\u201d. Justice Thomas should \u201cgo back and amend earlier disclosures in order to fully reflect the lavish gifts he\u2019s received over the years\u201d, he says. \nJustice Thomas\u2019s friendship with Mr Crow has been the linchpin of his justification for keeping mum about the billionaire\u2019s decades of largesse. \u201cHarlan and Kathy Crow are among our dearest friends,\u201d he wrote in April. \u201cAs friends do, we have joined them on a number of family trips during the more than quarter-century we have known them.\u201d Justice Thomas said he consulted with (unnamed) colleagues about his travel arrangements, and concluded that they fell under the \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d exception to the reporting requirement. (The exclusion refers to \u201cfood, lodging or entertainment\u201d from friends but does not mention transport.) Justice Thomas\u2019s new disclosures regarding Mr Crow were precipitated, he says, by a change in disclosure guidance in March 2023 from the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for federal courts. \nFor his part, Justice Alito attacked the ProPublica report about him in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. Private-jet travel was not reportable in 2008, he wrote. And anyway, he flew private rather than on a commercial plane because the seat \u201cwould have otherwise been vacant\u201d.\nThese defences do not sit well with Stephen Gillers, an expert on judicial ethics at New York University (NYU) law school. \u201cThe ordinary understanding of personal hospitality would be such things as a weekend at a friend\u2019s country home,\u201d he says. Justices Alito and Thomas are using \u201cnarrow and private\u201d understandings of the rules \u201cto justify their omissions\u201d. Melissa Murray, also at NYU, agrees. \u201cMost normal people would understand that private-jet travel or school tuition is not the same as having dinner at a friend\u2019s house.\u201d\nNews of the justices\u2019 generous friends  has stirred renewed debate in Congress over Supreme Court ethics reform. For conservatives, bills requiring the justices to adopt a code of conduct\u2014such as the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act of 2023, sponsored by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island\u2014are sour grapes from liberals depressed about the court\u2019s rightward turn. Justice Thomas\u2019s lawyer called recent attention to his client \u201ca partisan feeding frenzy\u201d and \u201cpolitical blood sport\u201d that will \u201cundermine public confidence in our republic\u201d. Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, said Democrats\u2019 calls for ethics reform are \u201ca political attack directed at a justice they hate\u201d. \nMonitoring munificence\nYet ethical questions are not exclusive to conservative justices. Several liberal ones failed to recuse themselves in cases where they appear to have had a conflict of interest. The late Ruth Bader Ginsburg took international trips on the dime of rich patrons (though she disclosed these). Justice Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s staff were enlisted to help sell her books. In 2016 Justice Stephen Breyer spoke at a \u201cprivate VIP dinner\u201d at a university where people paid $500 per plate (justices are not supposed to attend fundraisers, if that\u2019s what it was).\nThe justices have shown signs of an appetite for reform. Though he declined an invitation to testify to senators on the matter, Chief Justice John Roberts sent a letter to Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including a \u201cStatement on Ethics Principles and Practices\u201d which all the justices agreed to. The commitment is weaker than a full code of conduct\u2014something Justice Elena Kagan said was in the works back in 2019\u2014but it is something. \nFor Richard Re, a law professor at the University of Virginia, tighter congressional regulation presents an opportunity for the justices to \u201cincrease their public legitimacy\u201d by fully laying out their financial ties and gifts. He thinks Mr Whitehouse\u2019s bill may be too focused on rules for when justices must recuse themselves, and is ambiguous on how (or whether) it will be enforced, but is \u201cgood food for thought\u201d. The bill has little chance of making it through a divided Congress. \nStill, \u201cgetting a bit of pushback from elected officials is all to the good\u201d, says Dan Epps, who teaches law at Washington University in St Louis. He reckons that it reminds the justices that \u201cthey\u2019re not above the law and that they still work for us\u201d. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly
