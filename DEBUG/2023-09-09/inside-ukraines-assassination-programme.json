This was \u201ccertainly\u201d the case with Stanislav Rzhitsky, a former submarine commander believed to have fired the missiles that killed 38 Ukrainians in Vinnytsia in July 2022. He was shot dead a year later while jogging in a park in Krasnodar, in Russia. But other operations suggested an absence of strategy. They risked exposing sources, methods and the extent of Ukrainian infiltration into Russia: \u201cOur security services shouldn\u2019t do things just because they can.\u201d \nAndriy Yusov, a military-intelligence spokesman, insists Ukraine is avoiding what he called \u201cblind terror\u201d. The aim is \u201cnot to frighten the enemy,\u201d he says, but \u201cto force it from occupied Ukrainian lands.\u201d But Ukrainian spies would continue to \u201cidentify and take advantage of Russian psychology and vulnerabilities\u201d wherever they found them. \nOf course, the converse is also true. The infiltration of Ukraine\u2019s security services by Russian agents remains a big issue. In the estimation of some insiders, it is the largest single barrier to any attempts to create a Ukrainian Mossad. The former head of SBU\u2019s internal security has fled Ukraine under a cloud of suspicion, and is being investigated for treason in absentia. Trust remains an issue in the service, with all but the least sensitive operations conducted in small groups. \u201cPeople are always our weakest link,\u201d says the SBU counter-intelligence source. \u201cThey are by far the most slippery part of our calculations.\u201d \u25a0 \nCorrection (September 5th, 2023): An earlier version of this article inadvertently misquoted Mr Nalivaychenko.", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Crime and punishment", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Europe"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/75ks360ifh4d6k3c3n17b7s7uqcvb61a", "tegID": "75ks360ifh4d6k3c3n17b7s7uqcvb61a", "headline": "Europe", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/07/the-uncertain-future-of-greeks-in-turkey", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/59b75ttm49qbapnapua0op3pt2m8f130", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "The uncertain future of Greeks in Turkey", "subheadline": "Point of no return", "datePublished": "2023-09-07T14:20:20Z", "description": "The exodus steadily persists", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230909_EUP506.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/07/stuttgarts-ever-receding-station-is-germanys-latest-transport-fiasco", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/lje0lr6adgfue6i52fas84igpnr3cf4s", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Stuttgart\u2019s ever-receding station is Germany\u2019s latest transport fiasco", "subheadline": "German engineering", "datePublished": "2023-09-07T14:20:20Z", "description": "It has become a \u20ac12bn embarrassment", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230909_EUP004.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/06/the-eus-rotating-presidency-should-be-scrapped", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/piqddo46o3i56f5pod62nac94qj7d6p0", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "The EU\u2019s rotating presidency should be scrapped", "subheadline": "Charlemagne", "datePublished": "2023-09-06T17:58:12Z", "description": "Several misfiring ones are in prospect", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230909_EUD000.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/05/inside-ukraines-assassination-programme", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/9flerto0vtudm9ej7ff7efim9m94ppvm", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Inside Ukraine\u2019s assassination programme", "subheadline": "Crime and punishment", "datePublished": "2023-09-05T12:00:05Z", "description": "Its agents have become expert in dark revenge.

Ukraine\u2019s assassination programme", "headline": "Inside Ukraine\u2019s assassination programme", "section": "Europe", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/05/inside-ukraines-assassination-programme", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\n\nTHE OPERATION was a month in the making. Yevhen Yunakov, the mayor of Velykyi Burluk, in the Kharkiv region, had been identified as a collaborator with the Russians. \u201cCaucasus\u201d, a special-forces commander, and a group of local officers were given the job. His men watched their target meticulously for days: when he shopped; when and where he moved; the extent of his security. Once they detonated their bomb, from a distance, they disappeared to safe-houses inside occupied territory. The group would return to Ukrainian-controlled territory only weeks later, after the town had been liberated. Yunakov\u2019s body has never been found.  \nOver 18 months of war, dozens of people like Yunakov have been targeted in clinical operations across occupied Ukraine and inside Russia itself. They have been shot, blown up, hanged and even, on occasion, poisoned with doctored brandy. Ukraine is tight-lipped about its involvement in assassinations. But few doubt the increasingly competent signature of its security services. The agencies themselves drop heavy hints. \u201cAny person who betrays Ukraine, shoots at Ukrainians or fires missiles on Ukrainians should understand that they are being watched and will be brought to justice,\u201d says Andriy Cherniak, an officer of HUR, Ukraine\u2019s military-intelligence agency. In an interview in July his boss, General Kyrylo Budanov, went further: \u201cIf you are asking about [creating a version of] Mossad\u2026We don\u2019t need to. It already exists.\u201d \n\nMention of the Israeli spy agency animates Ukrainians, desperate for justice. In fact, the origins of political assassination are a little closer to home. Mossad learned much of its craft from the Soviet-era secret police and its founding practitioner, Pavel Sudoplatov, who was born in Melitopol in now-occupied southern Ukraine. In a quirk of history, Sudoplatov spent the 1930s infiltrating Ukrainian nationalist groups, and personally blew up one of their leaders with a chocolate-box bomb. (He also masterminded the assassination of Leon Trotsky in 1940.) \nIn modern Ukraine, assassinations date back to at least 2015, when its domestic security service (SBU) created a new body after Russia had seized Crimea and the eastern Donbas region. The elite fifth counter-intelligence directorate started life as a saboteur force in response to the invasion. It later came to focus on what is euphemistically called \u201cwet work\u201d. \nValentin Nalivaychenko, who headed the SBU at the time, says the switch came about when Ukraine\u2019s then leaders decided that a policy of imprisoning collaborators was not enough. Prisons were overflowing, but few were deterred. \u201cWe reluctantly came to the conclusion that we needed to eliminate terrorists,\u201d he says. A former officer of the directorate describes it in similar terms. \u201cWe needed to bring war to them.\u201d In 2015 and 2016 the directorate was linked to the assassinations of key Russian-backed commanders in the Donbas; Mikhail Tolstykh, aka \u201cGivi\u201d, killed in a rocket attack; Arsen Pavlov, aka \u201cMotorola\u201d, blown up in a lift; Alexander Zakharchenko, blown up in a restaurant (pictured). \nIntelligence insiders say the SBU\u2019s fifth directorate is playing a central role in counter-Russia operations. The SBU\u2019s relative size and budget\u2014five times bigger than HUR\u2019s\u2014mean it has been most able to pull off the most sophisticated jobs, for example bombing the Kerch bridge, linking Russia to Crimea, in October 2022. Others, though, emphasise the role of HUR, with its underground networks and increased wartime prominence. \u201cWe are mostly the white-collar guys,\u201d insists an SBU source. Another increasingly important player in occupied Ukraine is the Special Operations Forces (SSO). This is a relatively new group that co-ordinates Rukh Oporu (Resistance Movement), Ukraine\u2019s partisans. The operation in Kharkiv, for example, was the SSO\u2019s. Denys Yaroslavsky, an officer in the SSO, says the service is now pushing for more powers to \u0441onduct operations within Russia itself. That is not universally welcomed elsewhere in Ukraine\u2019s intelligence community. \nUkraine\u2019s president is understood to authorise the most controversial operations, though other decisions are delegated. A high-level government source with knowledge of the work declines to discuss the details: \u201cIt\u2019s important not to comment or even think about such operations.\u201d But he says that Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a clear order to avoid collateral damage among civilians. \u201cThe president communicates this instruction to people formally, and, on occasion, by shouting at them.\u201d Ukraine had to choose its targets carefully, the source adds; it might \u201cnot always\u201d have done so. \nUkraine\u2019s leadership came under particular scrutiny in October, when the New York Times reported that the American government was blaming it for a car-bomb that killed Darya Dugina, daughter of Alexander Dugin, a nationalistic philosopher. That sharpened an already-lively internal debate within Ukrainian intelligence. It was unclear if Ms Dugina was meant to die; some reports suggest she had switched cars with her father. \nBut a subsequent string of operations targeting mid-level propagandists showed a trend that few of the insiders interviewed for this article were happy with. \u201cThese are marginal figures,\u201d says one source in SBU counter-intelligence. \u201cIt makes me uncomfortable.\u201d The former SBU fifth-directorate officer suggests the operations were designed to impress the president rather than bring victory any closer. \u201cClowns, prostitutes and jokers are a constant around the Russian government,\u201d he says. \u201cKill one of them, and another will appear in their place.\u201d\nThe former spy says he is concerned that Ukraine\u2019s assassination campaign is driven by impulse rather than logic. Some of the killings have a useful psychological role, he says: to raise the cost of war crimes and the spirits of ordinary Ukrainians. This was \u201ccertainly\u201d the case with Stanislav Rzhitsky, a former submarine commander believed to have fired the missiles that killed 38 Ukrainians in Vinnytsia in July 2022. He was shot dead a year later while jogging in a park in Krasnodar, in Russia. But other operations suggested an absence of strategy. They risked exposing sources, methods and the extent of Ukrainian infiltration into Russia: \u201cOur security services shouldn\u2019t do things just because they can.\u201d \nAndriy Yusov, a military-intelligence spokesman, insists Ukraine is avoiding what he called \u201cblind terror\u201d. The aim is \u201cnot to frighten the enemy,\u201d he says, but \u201cto force it from occupied Ukrainian lands.\u201d But Ukrainian spies would continue to \u201cidentify and take advantage of Russian psychology and vulnerabilities\u201d wherever they found them. \nOf course, the converse is also true. The infiltration of Ukraine\u2019s security services by Russian agents remains a big issue. In the estimation of some insiders, it is the largest single barrier to any attempts to create a Ukrainian Mossad. The former head of SBU\u2019s internal security has fled Ukraine under a cloud of suspicion, and is being investigated for treason in absentia. Trust remains an issue in the service, with all but the least sensitive operations conducted in small groups. \u201cPeople are always our weakest link,\u201d says the SBU counter-intelligence source. \u201cThey are by far the most slippery part of our calculations.\u201d \u25a0 \nCorrection (September 5th, 2023): An earlier version of this article inadvertently misquoted Mr Nalivaychenko.", "description": "Its agents have become expert in dark revenge.
