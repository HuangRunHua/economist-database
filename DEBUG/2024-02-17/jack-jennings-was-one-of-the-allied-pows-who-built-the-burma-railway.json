Much of its route lay through dense, sticky jungle. It was a project of the occupying Japanese army, which used as slave labour around 200,000 Asian civilians and 60,000 Allied prisoners-of-war. Mr Jennings found himself in that category in February 1942, after his battalion in the 1st Cambridgeshire regiment was forced to surrender to the Japanese during the fall of Singapore.

Some had to be bodily lifted by teams of men and cantilevered into place as bridges over dips and streams. Hardwoods, he soon found, were as tough as they sounded, and felling them could disturb a swarm of big red ants that bit like hell. Bamboo, used also for fuel, sent splinters into flesh that could infect it.

Of course, he was weak to start with: sleeping, as they all were, on filthy bamboo slats in muddy shelters, subsisting on rice, vegetable water and a teaspoon of sugar, and working 11-hour shifts. But at least he didn\u2019t get the cholera which at one point was claiming 15 victims a day.

He felt sorry, in the railway years, that he had done that. But he put away thoughts of home in England, even of his fianc\u00e9e Mary waiting patiently in Staffordshire, and pretended instead that home was where he was, croaking bullfrogs, gruel and all.
