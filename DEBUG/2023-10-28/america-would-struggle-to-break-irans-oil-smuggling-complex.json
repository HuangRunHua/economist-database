company based in Dubai, bought the Ocean Kapal, an 18-year-old tanker. Since then the Panamanian-flagged vessel has been given a new name, Abundance III, and a new job. In April the ship delivered its first load of Iranian oil to the port of Dongjiakou in northern China. After completing a similar trip in September, it now lingers off Malaysia, where it may pick up yet another Iranian cargo. The ship is one of many to have recently joined the \u201cdark fleet\u201d tasked with moving Iranian oil, exports of which have surged from 380,000 barrels per day (b/d) in 2020 to 1.4m now (see chart).\n\nAlthough America retains harsh sanctions that target anyone helping to produce, ship or sell Iran\u2019s petroleum, the superpower\u2019s officials last year eased enforcement. They were hoping to clinch an accord on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme\u2014and, probably, to suppress prices in the run-up to America\u2019s presidential election. The number of people and firms added to Iran-related blacklists by ofac, America\u2019s enforcement agency, has dwindled. \nYet following Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel on October 7th, the Biden administration has come under pressure to shut loopholes, as Iran is Hamas\u2019s sponsor and oil proceeds fill the country\u2019s coffers. So far traders are unfazed: oil sells at $90 a barrel, down from $97 in September. But could a sanction snapback inflame markets?\nIran\u2019s smuggling network has become sleeker and more sophisticated since President Donald Trump put in place fresh sanctions in late 2018. The country\u2019s petroleum business is run by the National Iran Oil Company (nioc), a state monopoly. Its main customer is China\u2014not the country\u2019s large, state-owned firms, which are exposed to Western sanctions, but \u201cteapot refineries\u201d that snap up 95% of Iranian supplies. A glut in refining capacity is pushing these outfits to seek the cheapest crude available. Iran\u2019s trades at a $10-12 discount to the global benchmark, against $5 for Russia\u2019s as delivered to Chinese ports. The teapots make transactions in Chinese currency, rather than American dollars, which insulates them from sanctions.\nOld tankers, acquired by little-known middlemen, link the ends of the chain. Most would have gone to scrap because blue-chip charterers do not want them. Of the 102 extra-large tankers that have ferried Iranian oil in 2023, 42 did not do so last year and 27 have no history of ever carrying dodgy oil, according to Kpler, a ship-tracking firm. Often they do only a few voyages a year, for just a few years. But those who buy them see a return fast, because clandestine shipping commands extortionate rates. \nOwnership is disguised through shell companies registered in places such as China, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates (uae). Most of those fingered by America\u2019s Treasury department have Chinese names, suggesting beneficiaries are from the mainland. Some Chinese lenders also appear on its lists, but most are \u201csacrificial lambs\u201d that exist only to import Iranian oil, says Adam Smith of Gibson Dunn, a law firm. Iran\u2019s government offers insurance. \n\nIranian barrels often begin their journey at Kharg Island, north of the Strait of Hormuz (pictured). A small but growing number start in Jask, a new port south of the strait. This may become a preferred route, circumventing the crowded Hormuz choke point. Transponders are only turned on when ships go through narrow passages, says Homayoun Falakshahi of Kpler, and tankers rarely do the full journey. Some pick up fuel from other ships off the shores of Fujairah, a mega-terminal in the uae, through which a lot of disreputable petroleum, notably Russian, also passes. Many then transfer loads off the shores of Malaysia or Singapore, where smaller vessels take them to northern China\u2014often after being mixed with other crudes from places like Venezuela or mislabelled as a different petrochemical product. There the oil is stored before being transported to its final destination, most often in the coastal province of Shandong (see map). \nMany American lawmakers would like their administration to disrupt the trade. New sanctions are unlikely\u2014existing ones are already comprehensive\u2014but officials could strengthen enforcement. Would that sink the dark fleet and its enablers?\nA number of challenges exist. nioc has no dealings with America or in dollars, so is resistant to pressure. Meanwhile, only China\u2019s government can hit the teapots, and why would it bother? America would have to squeeze the middlemen. But with so many sanction programmes currently in place\u2014they also target Russia and Venezuela\u2014its capacity is stretched thin. Facilitators are harder to target than under President Trump, when India, South Korea and other countries sensitive to American pressure took part in the trade. \nRecent history suggests that companies bashed by America for flouting sanctions rapidly stop doing business, but that others emerge to fill the void. These operators would be all the less deterred given that Iran is blacklisted only by America (in contrast to Russia, whose oil all g7 members have embargoed). The Biden administration could always escalate by seizing Iranian ships en masse at sea, but that would demand huge resources, cause legal headaches and invite retaliation. \nAny disruption would thus probably only last for three months or so. Simulations by Rystad Energy, a consultancy, suggest there would be an initial drop of 300,000 b/d in Iranian exports. This loss\u2014equivalent to 0.3% of global demand\u2014could push up global oil prices by $4-5.\nA more extreme scenario, where rising tensions also mean that shipping is partly disrupted around Hormuz, say, and Gulf states crack down on Iranian helpers, would see another 400,000 b/d of Iranian crude vanish from the market. That would cause a bigger spike in the oil price, of perhaps 10%. But only for a moment. \nThat is because Iran\u2019s neighbours could ramp up production. The biggest members of opec, an oil-producing cartel, have 5.5m b/d of spare capacity. In theory, Saudi Arabia could plug the Iranian deficit without help. And opec would have a strong incentive to intervene: stratospheric oil prices would quickly destroy demand.\nAs a result, it would take an extraordinary series of events for oil to spend much time in the triple digits. America wants to show toughness towards sanction-evaders. This month, for the first time, it singled out two tanker owners for violating Russian restrictions. It is also relaxing sanctions on Venezuela, perhaps in anticipation of a drop in Iranian exports. Yet all this activity belies a simple fact: Iran\u2019s supply chains are supple enough to be largely immune to American measures. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "description": "After years of sanctions, it has become a sophisticated operation", "ogDescription": "After years of sanctions, it has become a sophisticated operation", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231028_FNP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-10-25T20:04:13Z", "dateModified": "2023-10-26T18:03:48Z", "dateCreated": "2023-10-25T07:59:12Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-10-28T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "Dubai", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/clqcavqibqk8ubd664crv8drufa6v49e", "publication": [{"id": "/content/cnk31nh4699kffhuum87fvtnhksm1d74", "context": {"position": 1600.62, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/lpr8bf59i59nnlsqupi0m9tmh9kc19jk", "context": {"position": 1600.62, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ghef87u4spts7m3tlvlhcf8r1oediq1e", "context": {"position": 1600.62, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2u73f4lu9pufjukqgn01em4gaoo71h0d", "context": {"position": 1600.62, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/5hgopv620saq0flo6tbjjpcn4fltkbq7", "context": {"position": 1600.62, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3rgnig31ab73ljbahaib7jp4roc8of8o", "context": {"position": 1600.62, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/5kk3qr6kfenv3rbv502vqndv0upe5688", "context": {"position": 1600.62, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ha4asa4gtvbihiasmln7enfjq76c1510", "context": {"position": 1600.62, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Israel\u2019s war economy is working\u2014for the time being", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/26/israels-war-economy-is-working-for-the-time-being", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2uiq2dvv4abaqtue8n0t7tbost9fg5bt", "publication": [{"id": "/content/cnk31nh4699kffhuum87fvtnhksm1d74", "context": {"position": 1600.58, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/lpr8bf59i59nnlsqupi0m9tmh9kc19jk", "context": {"position": 1600.58, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ghef87u4spts7m3tlvlhcf8r1oediq1e", "context": {"position": 1600.58, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2u73f4lu9pufjukqgn01em4gaoo71h0d", "context": {"position": 1600.58, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/5hgopv620saq0flo6tbjjpcn4fltkbq7", "context": {"position": 1600.58, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3rgnig31ab73ljbahaib7jp4roc8of8o", "context": {"position": 1600.58, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/5kk3qr6kfenv3rbv502vqndv0upe5688", "context": {"position": 1600.58, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ha4asa4gtvbihiasmln7enfjq76c1510", "context": {"position": 1600.58, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Investors are returning to hedge funds.
