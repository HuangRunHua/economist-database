It has had direct presidential elections only since 1996. Each time the race has come down to two main parties: the Nationalist Party, or KMT, which wants reunification with China, and the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Ahead of the election due in January, a third force has emerged. Ko Wen-je, a former mayor of Taipei and founder of the new Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP), is polling at 20-25%, on a par with the KMT\u2019s candidate, Hou Yu-ih. This has introduced complexity to the election and huge uncertainty about the island-state\u2019s future approach to China.\nNeither Mr Ko nor Mr Hou looks able to win on his own. The former mayor\u2019s rise has come mainly at the kmt\u2019s expense; at Taiwan\u2019s presidential election in 2020 its candidate won almost 40% of the vote. And the late entry into the race of a bombastic independent candidate, Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturer, has further split the anti-DPP vote. Yet if Mr Ko and Mr Hou could do a deal to unite their parties behind one candidate, the situation would change. Together they might defeat the ruling DPP, whose candidate, William Lai, is polling at 30-40%. Since October 14th the TPP and KMT have indeed been holding talks on a possible joint ticket. They have until November 24th, the registration deadline for presidential candidates, to unite. Otherwise, Mr Lai, Taiwan\u2019s vice-president, could be in line for an easy win. \nIn an interview with The Economist, Mr Ko draws a chart with the dpp and kmt at opposing ends of an ideological spectrum. He puts himself somewhere between them, as a \u201cpragmatic\u201d alternative. For 30 years Taiwanese politics has been consumed by a \u201cmeaningless\u201d debate about unification and independence, he says. Both are \u201cimpossible\u201d, in his view, because America will not allow unification and China will not allow independence. \u201cYoung people, especially intellectuals, are tired of seeing us spend so much time debating something that cannot be resolved,\u201d he says.  Instead he vows to focus on domestic concerns like jobs and housing.\nThis is a popular message. A recent survey by Commonwealth, a magazine, suggests most TPP supporters think economic development should be the next president\u2019s priority. Yet the survey also illustrates the limits of the tpp\u2019s appeal. It finds 46% of voters are worried about a possible war between Taiwan and China in the next five years. It also affirms that DPP supporters mainly worry about national security and KMT supporters about relations with China. Though domestic policy matters, China is the big issue in national elections. \nMr Ko\u2019s position on China is close to the KMT\u2019s. Both he and Mr Hou criticise the DPP for its inability to engage directly with the Chinese Communist Party. Chinese authorities have cut off communications with the DPP government because it refuses to state that Taiwan and mainland China belong to the same country. The KMT says it could reopen dialogue by returning to the 1992 consensus, a deliberately vague agreement between the mainland and Taiwanese authorities that there is \u201conly one China but with multiple interpretations\u201d. This was the basis for strong cross-straits ties during the kmt administration of President Ma Ying-jeou in 2008-16. Returning to it could reduce regional tensions, says Andrew Hsia, the KMT\u2019s vice-chairman.\nBut the mainland is not as flexible as it used to be. In 2019 Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, gave a speech linking the 1992 consensus with the mainland\u2019s one-China principle and proposed a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula for incorporating Taiwan. He did not mention the \u201cmultiple interpretations\u201d phrase cherished by the KMT. Mr Xi also stated that the Taiwan problem should not be passed \u201cfrom one generation to the next\u201d. That speech \u201cset the tone\u201d for a more assertive Chinese policy on Taiwan, says Yoshiyuki Ogasawara of the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies.\nKMT leaders acknowledge that Mr Xi is pushing harder for unification than they are. Revelations this week that Foxconn\u2019s tax affairs and land use are being investigated in China have only increased doubts about the mainland\u2019s forbearance; many Taiwanese assume this is a tactic to put pressure on Mr Gou. \u201cWe are not naive,\u201d says Mr Hsia, who has met top officials on several recent trips to the mainland. But the kmt still believes there is room for manoeuvre. Last year a Chinese state-run newspaper published an online commentary with the headline: \u201cThere is only one China, there are no multiple interpretations.\u201d The article was withdrawn after the KMT called Beijing to complain\u2014demonstrating the party\u2019s influence, says Mr Hsia.\nTaiwanese voters are more pessimistic. Most no longer believe in the viability of the 1992 consensus. Many have also lost faith in the KMT\u2019s claim to prioritise Taiwanese sovereignty over its supporters\u2019 interests. The term maiban, or \u201ccompradors\u201d, is used to refer to Taiwanese companies that profited from investments in the mainland under Mr Ma. Mr Ko also slams the KMT for the maiban phenomenon. The party is \u201ctoo submissive to China\u201d, he says. It has \u201clost the Taiwanese people\u2019s trust\u201d.\nEven so, most Taiwanese want dialogue with China. Asked which was more important, cross-strait or international (meaning external but non-China) relations, about a third of voters chose international, while a fifth said cross-strait. Almost half said Taiwan should prioritise both.\nThat suggests many Taiwanese want a more flexible approach to China than the dpp\u2019s, but a tougher one than the kmt\u2019s. Mr Ko is benefiting from this. He says he has asked Chinese authorities to consider using an alternative formula, which would be less divisive than the 1992 consensus. They are \u201cthinking about it\u201d, he claims. It is not clear what this new formula would be, though Mr Ko has previously proposed the phrase \u201cTwo sides of the strait, one family\u201d as a basis for cross-strait relations.\nMore important than any new formula, he says, is to reset the dial. He vows to stress Taiwan\u2019s shared heritage with China, promote people-to-people exchanges and avoid political rows. He cites a Chinese saying: \u201cIf you have good relations, anything can be discussed. If you have bad relations, nothing can be discussed.\u201d \nThat is in step with the KMT. Yet the opposition parties are struggling to unite. After their first meeting each accused the other of being disingenuous. Mr Ko told The Economist he would only agree to a coalition that could win\u2014and that this meant he must be its presidential candidate. It is possible. The kmt covets the TPP\u2019s young supporters. \u201cNo one under 40 will vote for the KMT,\u201d says Mr Ko. His KMT counterpart, Mr Hou, has suggested he might accept being Mr Ko\u2019s running-mate.\nBut that would be a bitter pill for the KMT. It is much larger, older and better organised than the TPP. And Mr Ko\u2019s derisive comments about the party do not augur well for his dealmaking powers: the KMT is a \u201cbig old brother\u201d that \u201ccannot swallow\u201d its pride, he says. Moreover, even if the two parties could agree on the top of the ticket, they would need to work out an acceptable distribution of cabinet members, something they are only beginning to discuss. If they can fix these issues over the next month, Taiwan could be in for a very tight race. But don\u2019t hold your breath. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Can the opposition unite?", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Asia"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/rs4nm4v2h4rdrnt5hrncvqkmtr2sbrr4", "tegID": "rs4nm4v2h4rdrnt5hrncvqkmtr2sbrr4", "headline": "Asia", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/26/taiwans-opposition-parties-are-struggling-to-unite", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/qb0u47vc4afhhv4k26f3n28ki2misg9n", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "Taiwan\u2019s opposition parties are struggling to unite", "subheadline": "Strait talk", "datePublished": "2023-10-26T12:35:33Z", "description": "An interview with the island-democracy\u2019s political wild card, Ko Wen-je", "image": {"main": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231028_ASD002.jpg", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "__typename": "Media", "promo": null}}, {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/26/what-gift-would-you-give-narendra-modi", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/mkmbhoooba15qk6f0vkjgpst9osv8gi6", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "headline": "What gift would you give Narendra Modi?", "subheadline": "Present perfect", "datePublished": "2023-10-26T12:35:33Z", "description": "Religious art is good.

"https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/26/taiwans-opposition-parties-are-struggling-to-unite", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Taiwan is a young democracy. It has had direct presidential elections only since 1996. Each time the race has come down to two main parties: the Nationalist Party, or KMT, which wants reunification with China, and the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Ahead of the election due in January, a third force has emerged. Ko Wen-je, a former mayor of Taipei and founder of the new Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP), is polling at 20-25%, on a par with the KMT\u2019s candidate, Hou Yu-ih. This has introduced complexity to the election and huge uncertainty about the island-state\u2019s future approach to China.\nNeither Mr Ko nor Mr Hou looks able to win on his own. The former mayor\u2019s rise has come mainly at the kmt\u2019s expense; at Taiwan\u2019s presidential election in 2020 its candidate won almost 40% of the vote. And the late entry into the race of a bombastic independent candidate, Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturer, has further split the anti-DPP vote. Yet if Mr Ko and Mr Hou could do a deal to unite their parties behind one candidate, the situation would change. Together they might defeat the ruling DPP, whose candidate, William Lai, is polling at 30-40%. Since October 14th the TPP and KMT have indeed been holding talks on a possible joint ticket. They have until November 24th, the registration deadline for presidential candidates, to unite. Otherwise, Mr Lai, Taiwan\u2019s vice-president, could be in line for an easy win. \nIn an interview with The Economist, Mr Ko draws a chart with the dpp and kmt at opposing ends of an ideological spectrum. He puts himself somewhere between them, as a \u201cpragmatic\u201d alternative. For 30 years Taiwanese politics has been consumed by a \u201cmeaningless\u201d debate about unification and independence, he says. Both are \u201cimpossible\u201d, in his view, because America will not allow unification and China will not allow independence. \u201cYoung people, especially intellectuals, are tired of seeing us spend so much time debating something that cannot be resolved,\u201d he says.  Instead he vows to focus on domestic concerns like jobs and housing.\nThis is a popular message. A recent survey by Commonwealth, a magazine, suggests most TPP supporters think economic development should be the next president\u2019s priority. Yet the survey also illustrates the limits of the tpp\u2019s appeal. It finds 46% of voters are worried about a possible war between Taiwan and China in the next five years. It also affirms that DPP supporters mainly worry about national security and KMT supporters about relations with China. Though domestic policy matters, China is the big issue in national elections. \nMr Ko\u2019s position on China is close to the KMT\u2019s. Both he and Mr Hou criticise the DPP for its inability to engage directly with the Chinese Communist Party. Chinese authorities have cut off communications with the DPP government because it refuses to state that Taiwan and mainland China belong to the same country. The KMT says it could reopen dialogue by returning to the 1992 consensus, a deliberately vague agreement between the mainland and Taiwanese authorities that there is \u201conly one China but with multiple interpretations\u201d. This was the basis for strong cross-straits ties during the kmt administration of President Ma Ying-jeou in 2008-16. Returning to it could reduce regional tensions, says Andrew Hsia, the KMT\u2019s vice-chairman.\nBut the mainland is not as flexible as it used to be. In 2019 Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, gave a speech linking the 1992 consensus with the mainland\u2019s one-China principle and proposed a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula for incorporating Taiwan. He did not mention the \u201cmultiple interpretations\u201d phrase cherished by the KMT. Mr Xi also stated that the Taiwan problem should not be passed \u201cfrom one generation to the next\u201d. That speech \u201cset the tone\u201d for a more assertive Chinese policy on Taiwan, says Yoshiyuki Ogasawara of the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies.\nKMT leaders acknowledge that Mr Xi is pushing harder for unification than they are. Revelations this week that Foxconn\u2019s tax affairs and land use are being investigated in China have only increased doubts about the mainland\u2019s forbearance; many Taiwanese assume this is a tactic to put pressure on Mr Gou. \u201cWe are not naive,\u201d says Mr Hsia, who has met top officials on several recent trips to the mainland. But the kmt still believes there is room for manoeuvre. Last year a Chinese state-run newspaper published an online commentary with the headline: \u201cThere is only one China, there are no multiple interpretations.\u201d The article was withdrawn after the KMT called Beijing to complain\u2014demonstrating the party\u2019s influence, says Mr Hsia.\nTaiwanese voters are more pessimistic. Most no longer believe in the viability of the 1992 consensus. Many have also lost faith in the KMT\u2019s claim to prioritise Taiwanese sovereignty over its supporters\u2019 interests. The term maiban, or \u201ccompradors\u201d, is used to refer to Taiwanese companies that profited from investments in the mainland under Mr Ma. Mr Ko also slams the KMT for the maiban phenomenon. The party is \u201ctoo submissive to China\u201d, he says. It has \u201clost the Taiwanese people\u2019s trust\u201d.\nEven so, most Taiwanese want dialogue with China. Asked which was more important, cross-strait or international (meaning external but non-China) relations, about a third of voters chose international, while a fifth said cross-strait. Almost half said Taiwan should prioritise both.\nThat suggests many Taiwanese want a more flexible approach to China than the dpp\u2019s, but a tougher one than the kmt\u2019s. Mr Ko is benefiting from this. He says he has asked Chinese authorities to consider using an alternative formula, which would be less divisive than the 1992 consensus. They are \u201cthinking about it\u201d, he claims. It is not clear what this new formula would be, though Mr Ko has previously proposed the phrase \u201cTwo sides of the strait, one family\u201d as a basis for cross-strait relations.\nMore important than any new formula, he says, is to reset the dial. He vows to stress Taiwan\u2019s shared heritage with China, promote people-to-people exchanges and avoid political rows. He cites a Chinese saying: \u201cIf you have good relations, anything can be discussed. If you have bad relations, nothing can be discussed.\u201d \nThat is in step with the KMT. Yet the opposition parties are struggling to unite. After their first meeting each accused the other of being disingenuous. Mr Ko told The Economist he would only agree to a coalition that could win\u2014and that this meant he must be its presidential candidate. It is possible. The kmt covets the TPP\u2019s young supporters. \u201cNo one under 40 will vote for the KMT,\u201d says Mr Ko. His KMT counterpart, Mr Hou, has suggested he might accept being Mr Ko\u2019s running-mate.\nBut that would be a bitter pill for the KMT. It is much larger, older and better organised than the TPP. And Mr Ko\u2019s derisive comments about the party do not augur well for his dealmaking powers: the KMT is a \u201cbig old brother\u201d that \u201ccannot swallow\u201d its pride, he says. Moreover, even if the two parties could agree on the top of the ticket, they would need to work out an acceptable distribution of cabinet members, something they are only beginning to discuss. If they can fix these issues over the next month, Taiwan could be in for a very tight race. But don\u2019t hold your breath. \u25a0", "description": "An interview with the island-democracy\u2019s political wild card, Ko Wen-je", "ogDescription": "An interview with the island-democracy\u2019s
