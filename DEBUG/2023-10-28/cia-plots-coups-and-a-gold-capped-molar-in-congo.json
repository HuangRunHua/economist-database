There are villains of every stripe, from rogue Belgian pilots to shamelessly scheming UN officials and racist ambassadors.

Lumumba then called the UN, which launched its first big peacekeeping mission. That descended into chaos, as Lumumba railed against the UN\u2019s reluctance to kick out the Belgians immediately and reconquer secessionist Katanga.\nIgnorant American officials interpreted Lumumba\u2019s anti-imperialism as communism. Mr Reid argues convincingly that Lumumba was willing to appeal to the Soviets to help chuck out the Belgians but that he was not red.

By Stuart Reid. Knopf; 624 pages; $35 and \u00a330\nPatrice Lumumba was prime minister of newly independent Congo for less than three months in 1960, before he was murdered at the age of 35. Yet his tumultuous life\u2014and gruesome death\u2014set a pattern for coups and post-colonial interference that shaped Congo\u2019s torrid path, as well as the gameplan for CIA interventions and assassinations worldwide. \n\u201cThe Lumumba Plot\u201d by Stuart Reid, an editor at Foreign Affairs, is many things at once: a biography, a history of Congo\u2019s chaotic independence, a dissection of the UN\u2019s first big peacekeeping mission and a thriller about plots to kill Lumumba. There are villains of every stripe, from rogue Belgian pilots to shamelessly scheming UN officials and racist ambassadors. This is a tragic tale but also a rollicking read. \nHeroes are in short supply. The charismatic Lumumba repeatedly auditions for the role with stirring calls for Congolese independence and unity, but he is too egotistic and impulsive. As a young postal clerk he embezzled two years\u2019 worth of salary from his job. As prime minister, he agreed to a 50-year, $2bn contract for the country\u2019s mineral and hydroelectric resources with a dodgy financier in Delaware\u2014without consulting his economy minister. (He managed to wriggle out of it.) \nThe overwhelming tension in post-independence Congo, a country four times the size of France, was between the former coloniser, Belgium, and the elected prime minister, Lumumba. Frequently racist Belgian officials were angered by Lumumba\u2019s anti-colonial rhetoric, including an unscheduled speech at the independence ceremony. \u201cWe have suffered contempt, insults and blows morning, noon and evening, because we were Negroes,\u201d he declared in front of the fuming Belgian king. Lumumba, having won independence on paper, wanted it in practice. \nHe did not get it. Belgium was soon plotting to assassinate him, at one point hiring a Greek hitman who took the money and ran, and backed the secession of an eastern province, Katanga, in order to retain influence and loosen Lumumba\u2019s grip on power. Lumumba then called the UN, which launched its first big peacekeeping mission. That descended into chaos, as Lumumba railed against the UN\u2019s reluctance to kick out the Belgians immediately and reconquer secessionist Katanga.\nIgnorant American officials interpreted Lumumba\u2019s anti-imperialism as communism. Mr Reid argues convincingly that Lumumba was willing to appeal to the Soviets to help chuck out the Belgians but that he was not red. Even Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, was baffled that America did not see Lumumba as a natural ally. (\u201cReally, are the Americans that stupid?\u201d he asked.) The CIA\u2019s fears of Lumumba\u2019s communism eventually led Dwight Eisenhower, America\u2019s president, to order his assassination. (Some dispute how direct the order was, but Mr Reid leaves little doubt.)\nWhat followed was a string of failed CIA plots involving injecting poison into his toothpaste and trying to snipe him. \u201cThe hunting is good here when the light\u2019s right,\u201d wrote Larry Devlin, the CIA station chief, and asked headquarters to send him a \u201chigh-powered, foreign-make rifle with a telescopic sight and a silencer\u201d. \nLumumba was ultimately undone by a coup, the first in post-colonial Africa, carried out by Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu and backed by the CIA. The American ambassador told Washington that Mobutu was \u201ccompletely honest\u201d. (He would later rule Congo kleptocratically for 32 years.) Lumumba was handed over to secessionists in Katanga where, within hours, he met a predictably grisly death. Congo has been ruled despotically ever since. \nMr Reid seems keen to pin the blame for Lumumba\u2019s demise on Americans. Yet Belgium, like America, had tried to assassinate Lumumba and also backed the secessionist province where he was murdered. Two Belgians oversaw his torture (which included stuffing splinters under his toenails) and murder by gunfire. Two of Lumumba\u2019s gold-capped molars were all that remained after another Belgian dug up his body and dissolved it in acid to hide the crime. One tooth wound up in Brussels\u2014until its return to Congo last year. \nLumumba\u2019s life might seem of a distant, dramatic era. Yet this story feels timely. In Africa coups are back in fashion, as is anti-colonial rhetoric, especially against France. Western fears about Russian influence in Africa are rightly resurgent. And as Congo prepares for an election in December, another disappointing UN peacekeeping mission has been asked to leave. \nPeople trying to understand Congo today should glean lessons from Lumumba\u2019s short life, such as the danger of seeing Africa solely through the lens of great-power rivalries. But memories are short. Some 15 years after Lumumba\u2019s death, Richard Helms, a CIA official, told a Senate inquiry: \u201cI am relatively certain that he represented something that the United States government didn\u2019t like, but I can\u2019t remember any more what it was.\u201d Stumped, he asked for help. \u201cWhat was wrong with Lumumba? Why didn\u2019t we like him?\u201d \u25a0", "description": "A new book traces the rise and demise of Patrice Lumumba", "ogDescription": "A new book traces the rise and demise of Patrice Lumumba",
