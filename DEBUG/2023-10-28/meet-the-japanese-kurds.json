- Meet the Japanese Kurds | Asia | The Economist", "shareSnippet": "Warabistan \u2013 Meet the Japanese Kurds", "headline": "Meet the Japanese Kurds", "section": "Asia", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/10/26/meet-the-japanese-kurds", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "In a classroom in Warabi, north of Tokyo, an 11-year-old boy chatters in Japanese as he practises writing the characters for \u201criver\u201d and \u201ctree\u201d. The scene is unremarkable, save for the fact that the boy, Boran, is not Japanese but Kurdish. Warabi and the surrounding area are home to around 2,000 Turkish Kurds, a number that has quadrupled in a decade. Kebab shops line the streets and instructions on sorting rubbish are written in Turkish. The area is known locally as \u201cWarabistan\u201d.\nThe community illustrates one of the biggest social changes in Japan in decades. The country\u2019s ageing and shrinking labour force sorely needs fresh blood. Yet Japanese policymakers remain deeply averse to immigration. The result is a largely unacknowledged policy of letting in increasing numbers of immigrants through the back door. Japan\u2019s foreign-born population has tripled since 1990, reaching a record 3m, or 2.4% of the population, in 2022. \nWarabi and its environs illustrate the trend. The 40,000 foreign-born residents of Kawaguchi, a neighbouring city, represent 6.8% of its population, a level that would have been unimaginable a decade or two ago. These migrants are essential to the local economy. Yet many are in Japan illegally or on sufferance, as longtime asylum-seekers without work permits. \nKawaguchi city is known for its metal-casting industry. Most of its factories now depend on migrants from the Philippines and Vietnam. Kurds first came to the area in the 1990s, looking for economic opportunity and fleeing oppression in Turkey. Many married local women and had children. They have also helped create a hub for demolition firms. \u201cI bet the industry wouldn\u2019t survive without us,\u201d said Ali, a Kurdish asylum-seeker, who worked for a local demolition company for 25 years, rising at 4am to work six days a week. JICA, a government agency, estimates that to meet its growth targets, Japan needs to quadruple its number of foreign workers by 2040. \nMost asylum-seekers live precariously. Only one Kurd has been granted formal refugee status. Thousands do not have valid visas or work permits, and are often detained for overstaying their visas or working illegally. Since arriving in Japan three decades ago, and applying for asylum, Ali has been detained for four years in total. \u201cHow are we supposed to survive if we don\u2019t have any income?\u201d he asks.\nMigrant children suffer the consequences. According to the education ministry, in 2022 around 10,000 of those of school age in Japan were not at school. Komuro Takako, who runs the weekend Japanese classes that Boran was attending, says many schools in Kawaguchi used to reject children who could not write Japanese. Since she started holding the classes seven years ago, things have improved. Yet private schools and colleges still often refuse children of parents without a visa; only a handful of Kurds make it to university. Zehra, a 30-year-old Kurd, shows off her daughter\u2019s excellent elementary-school grades, then adds: \u201cI hope our status as refugees doesn\u2019t get in the way of her future.\u201d\nKurds no way\nLocal Japanese rarely welcome the migrants. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about the foreigners,\u201d says a Japanese man who has lived in Kawaguchi for 50 years. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for us to interact.\u201d Some Kurds have tried to reach out. One recent morning Vakkas Balibay joined his Japanese neighbours to clean Warabi city park, sweeping the pavement for hours. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a thick wall between us and the Japanese people,\u201d says Mr Balibay, who has lived in Warabistan for 22 years. \nRight-wingers are trying to mobilise people against Japan\u2019s stealthy diversification. Outside Kawaguchi station, Nakamura Kazuhiro of the ultra-right Japan First Party stood on the roof of a van beside the imperial Japanese flag. \u201cJapan must stop accepting migrants,\u201d he roared through a speaker. Kawaguchi\u2019s migrant population, he claimed, is \u201ccausing terrible harm to the lives of Japanese people\u201d.\nIn recent months, right-wingers like Mr Nakamura have targeted Warabistan. The trigger was a brawl among some Kurds in July, which allegedly caused a hospital emergency ward to shut down for five hours. Conservative media dug up more allegations of bad manners or disturbances on Kurdish-run demolition sites. In June a branch of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) proposed that Kawaguchi\u2019s city council should take steps to crack down on criminal foreigners. \u201cSome local residents feel like they can\u2019t even walk outside because it\u2019s dangerous out there,\u201d says Okutomi Seiichi, who instigated the proposal. \nSuch controversies are a distraction from the central problem. Politicians have not accepted the reality of an economy increasingly reliant on immigrants. This makes immigrant life precarious, leading to some of the frictions right-wingers cite. \u201cIt\u2019s one-sided to blame the Kurds,\u201d says Nukui Tatsuhiro of Together with Kurds in Japan, a non-profit. Even Mr Okutomi of the ldp puts some of the blame for rowdy Kurds on the government. It only \u201cthinks about filling in labour shortages\u201d, not \u201cforeign migrants\u2019 day-to-day lives\u201d, he says.\nOpinion polls suggest younger Japanese are more welcoming, a disparity that is likely to increase with the migrant population. Growing up with classmates who look or sound foreign is routine for Japanese children in and around Warabistan. At some schools in Kawaguchi, 30% of pupils are from migrant families. \u201cI can also speak Turkish and Kurdish,\u201d says Boran, the eager weekend student, speaking in his native Japanese. \u201cBut I\u2019m Japanese.\u201d\u25a0", "description": "A Kurdish community illustrates the senselessness of Japan\u2019s immigration regime", "ogDescription": "A Kurdish community illustrates the
