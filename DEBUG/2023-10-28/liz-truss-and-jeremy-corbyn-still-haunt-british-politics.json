"https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/24/liz-truss-and-jeremy-corbyn-still-haunt-british-politics", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Welcome to the haunted house of Westminster. It is a year since Liz Truss left office, after serving as prime minister for 49 days. Britons are going to keep hearing about her for a lot longer than that. At the Labour Party\u2019s conference this month, few shadow-cabinet ministers missed a jibe at her expense\u2014and, by extension, at that of her successor, Rishi Sunak. The message: that he is weak and she is still running the show. \u201cWe all know that he\u2019s just Ken in her Barbie-world,\u201d said Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader.\nThe compliment is returned. At the Tory party conference, speeches were replete with references to Jeremy Corbyn. Never mind that he quit as Labour\u2019s leader more than three years ago, and that he is barred from running as a Labour MP. The message: that by having loyally served under him, his successor is an untrustworthy shape-shifter. \u201cRather like Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer truly is a Marxist. Because as Groucho Marx put it, \u2018I have principles, but if you don\u2019t like them, well, I have others\u2019,\u201d zinged Mel Stride, the welfare secretary.\nTargeting such calamitous predecessors makes sense for both parties, notes Tom Hamilton, a former Labour adviser. Whatever their faults, Mr Sunak and Sir Keir \u201cpass a basic test of looking as if they can more or less do the job\u201d. Sir Keir has higher approval ratings now than Mr Corbyn did at the last election, at -22% to -50% respectively. Mr Sunak\u2019s wilting ratings outstrip Ms Truss\u2019s, at -40% to -70%. \nIn both cases the attacks contain some fragments of truth. Repudiating Mr Corbyn and his followers has been Sir Keir\u2019s defining project since he became party leader. The shadow cabinet has been remade. So have local Labour branches: votes at conference suggest the proportion run by the \u201chard left\u201d has fallen from 80% in 2018 to 23% this year, according to Luke Akehurst, a Starmerite member of the party\u2019s governing body. Yet Sir Keir has never given a compelling explanation for why, unlike many colleagues, he served in his predecessor\u2019s shadow cabinet for over three years. The charge of opportunism lingers. \nMr Sunak ran against Ms Truss in the Tory leadership contest in 2022, adhering to the \u201cabacus economics\u201d that she rejected. Although Ms Truss is an unpopular figure among Tory MPs, the prime minister has criticised her disastrous term in office only in mild terms (\u201csome mistakes were made\u201d). The charge of weakness sticks.  \u201cWhen is he going to say \u2018Liz Truss can\u2019t stand for the next election?\u2019 That would be bold,\u201d Sir Keir told an interviewer. \nThe parallels between the two former leaders go well beyond their roles as campaign fodder. Undeterred by their failures at home, both hanker to fix the world. Ms Truss is working on a book entitled \u201cTen Years to Save the West\u201d. The fact that Labour rejoices with every public appearance won\u2019t silence her as the election approaches. Mr Corbyn\u2019s \u201cPeace & Justice Project\u201d, a sort of campaign group, has similarly vaulting objectives\u2014among them ending conflict and achieving \u201cclimate justice\u201d. Quite how is left unsaid. It hosts a conference in London on November 18th; he toys with a run to become the city\u2019s mayor.\nBoth figures press on something neuralgic in their parties. Ms Truss is a reminder of a double Tory failure: the acute blunder of the mini-budget of September 2022, and the chronic inability to restrain the ballooning tax burden. Shortly before the Treasury\u2019s autumn fiscal statement on November 22nd, Ms Truss\u2019s supporters will lay out a rival tax-cutting manifesto. Mr Sunak can hardly discipline her for preaching lower taxes, since he and the rest of the party agree with that goal in principle. \nAs for Mr Corbyn, it has been easy to see his leadership victory in 2015 as an aberration. But he did not come from the moon. His vague homilies on peace appealed to Labour members who had grown sceptical of British foreign policy, especially in the Middle East, since the Iraq war of 2003. Before him came Ed Miliband, who had opposed air strikes against the Syrian regime in 2013 in light of \u201cthe lessons of Iraq\u201d. \nThat all seemed like ancient history, until now. Sir Keir has been determined to show Labour\u2019s support for Israel after the attacks by Hamas, and to stamp out a reputation for anti-Semitism that grew during Mr Corbyn\u2019s tenure. But his suggestion, later clarified, that it would be legitimate to cut off water and electricity to Gaza caused a ripple of anger among Labour\u2019s rank and file, Muslims in particular. Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, could be found at the head of large pro-Palestinian demonstrations in London. Neither ghost is fully exorcised. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "description": "Two former leaders
