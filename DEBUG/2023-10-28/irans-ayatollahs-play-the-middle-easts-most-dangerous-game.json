become a wider Middle East conflagration are flashing ominously. America has sent a second carrier strike group led by the USS Eisenhower to the Persian Gulf. \u201cThere\u2019s a likelihood of escalation,\u201d said Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, on October 22nd. The chances of further attacks by Iranian proxies on American forces are growing, he continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see a second or third front develop.\u201d \nFears are also growing in Lebanon that Israel could use America\u2019s cover to launch a pre-emptive strike. Israel has evacuated its towns near the border with Lebanon and Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, has cautioned that if Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, enters the fighting, the consequences for Lebanon will be devastating. One reason Israel has delayed its offensive in Gaza may be to bolster its preparations for escalation on its northern front. Iran\u2019s foreign minister has said the region is like a \u201cpowder keg\u201d. \nRead more on the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIran\u2019s autocratic rulers hold one of the matches that could set it alight: an \u201caxis of resistance\u201d, or network of violent proxies across the region. They have spent two decades building this up in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Iran preys on places where the local polity is weak, where it is easy to funnel in personnel and weapons and where no external actor can challenge it, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank based in London. Iran\u2019s ability to cause mayhem at arm\u2019s length\u2014through Hamas, Hizbullah, Iraq\u2019s plethora of Shia militias and Yemen\u2019s Houthis\u2014may even give it more leverage than its conventional military capabilities, which are relatively weak. \nIran\u2019s goal right now, as it has been over the past decade, is not to provoke outright war with the West and its allies but to sow uncertainty and instability. Just as it has hovered on the threshold of becoming a nuclear power, so it maintains strategic ambiguity with the axis. It denies it is in charge while supplying armed groups like the Houthis with arms, giving them training and using them as fronts to conduct attacks, such as a missile strike on Saudi Aramco in 2019 which temporarily shuttered 5% of global oil production. The purpose is to intimidate while complicating the West\u2019s calculus. That strategy pleases Iran\u2019s ever-closer friend, Russia. Similarly isolated from the West, it engages in weapons trade and sanctions-busting with the Islamic republic: think of Iranian-designed Shahed-136 kamikaze drones killing Ukrainians.  \nThe present crisis shows the opportunities and problems of Iran\u2019s approach. It has long sponsored Hamas but did not appear to know in advance about its attack on Israel on October 7th, according to Western officials familiar with the matter. Yet it has sought to capitalise on Hamas\u2019s atrocities and mobilise the axis of resistance. Hizbullah and Israel have exchanged fire, with the explicit support of Iran and America, respectively. As many as 19 of Hizbullah\u2019s fighters have been killed. The Houthis, who control Yemen\u2019s capital, have launched three medium-range cruise missiles, recently acquired from Iran, and a number of drones towards Eilat, Israel\u2019s port city (they were intercepted by an American destroyer). And Iranian-backed Shia militias in Syria and Iraq have broadened the struggle by repeatedly targeting bases housing American troops with rockets and drones (America has drawn down its diplomatic presence in Iraq as a result).\n\nFor Iran, there are some obvious benefits. The conflagration in Gaza has halted\u2014even if only temporarily\u2014talks on normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Any such agreement would mark a further step in the Abraham accords through which Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates have since 2020 established diplomatic ties with Israel. Iran\u2019s Shia ayatollahs cannot stand the idea of being isolated as Sunni-led Muslim states and Israel co-operate more. A push to delegitimise the Abraham accords continues: at a meeting of Muslim foreign ministers in Saudi Arabia on October 18th, Iran called on Muslim countries to impose an oil embargo on Israel. The Iranian regime is backing calls to push Egypt to take in Palestinians from Gaza, perhaps in the hope of aggravating tensions between Israel and its oldest Arab ally.\nRegional turmoil also means more cash for Iran, at least for now. Oil prices have climbed by over $5 per barrel since October 7th. America is anxious to tamp down inflation in the run-up to its election next year and has been tacitly allowing Iran to export more oil, despite formally retaining sanctions. \u201cThose Iranian barrels are very important\u201d to Joe Biden, says Ahmed Mehdi, a London-based oil analyst. Production has topped 3m barrels per day, its highest levels since the Trump administration imposed sanctions in 2018. Year on year, Mr Mehdi says, exports are up by over a third.\nYet the escalating proxy war with America and its friends comes with big risks for Iran. At home officials crow that they have become \u201cstatesmen\u201d again, with president Ebrahim Raisi\u2014viewed by many in the West as a hardline pariah\u2014speaking to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in recent days. Ordinary Iranians are less impressed. A regional war could prompt a new cycle of protests at home. Armita Geravand, an Iranian schoolgirl who collapsed on October 1st after a beating from the morality police, according to local activists, has been declared brain-dead\u2014news that could revive the outrage that brought Iranian protesters into the streets in 2022 after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, detained for \u201cimproperly\u201d wearing the mandatory veil. Iranians are exhausted by their regime\u2019s adventures abroad and reluctant to endure more suffering for Palestine. Government-organised protests have been sparsely attended. A minute\u2019s silence at a football match in Tehran for those killed in Gaza was interrupted by raucous guffaws. \u201cNeither Gaza nor Lebanon,\u201d protesters chanted from their windows. \u201cWe sacrifice our lives for Iran.\u201d\nIran\u2019s shadow war is a delicate game and it is not clear that the country can control its proxies. Since America\u2019s assassination of Qassem Suleimani, one of the masterminds behind the axis of resistance, three years ago, Iran\u2019s satellites have increased their autonomy. As they hurl threats of war along with their rockets, they may find it hard to step back from their rhetoric. Each has set \u201cred lines\u201d for intervention against Israel and the West. A failure to respond could puncture their credibility with local supporters. An Israeli ground invasion of Gaza could force their hand. \nThe proxies must also balance their military aspirations with the interests of their host countries. According to Iranian officials, Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, has told Hizbullah he has no desire to heed its calls to attack Israel from his territory. In his view, Hamas betrayed him by siding with the rebellion against him in 2011 after he gave them sanctuary. He does not want to fight for them now. \nLebanon fears being another sacrificial pawn. Its Shias are the country\u2019s largest sect, but its other 17 official denominations form a majority. Tellingly, Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbullah\u2019s leader famed for his belligerent speeches, has shied from addressing his public from his bunker in Beirut since the fighting began. The threat of war has kiboshed Lebanon\u2019s hopes of a tourism revival. Lloyd\u2019s, an insurance firm, has signalled it could withdraw cover, and Middle East Airlines, Lebanon\u2019s national carrier, is docking some of its fleet in Turkey. America has told its citizens to leave. The Lebanese prime minister has said \u201cthe decision regarding war and peace\u201d is out of his hands.\nIf Iran\u2019s proxies attack American interests, or possibly Israel, it is most likely that America retaliates against them, rather than their sponsor Iran, in the first instance. Still, that is a high-stakes gamble. And in the long run Iran\u2019s decision to mobilise the axis of resistance signals it is heading towards isolation and autocracy. Only a month ago, the regime was celebrating a prisoner exchange with America and the imminent transfer to Iran of $6bn of frozen oil revenues. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had blessed direct talks for the first time since the Trump administration withdrew from a nuclear deal. Some spoke of a new detente. Now that lies in tatters\u2014and the chances of a catastrophic wider war, while still low, are far too high for comfort. \u25a0", "description": "They want to escalate without triggering full-blown
