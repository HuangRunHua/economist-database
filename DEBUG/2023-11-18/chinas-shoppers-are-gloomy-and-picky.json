shoppers are gloomy and picky", "section": "China", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/16/chinas-shoppers-are-gloomy-and-picky", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Five years ago Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, briefly tried his hand at selling lipstick. To promote China\u2019s largest online shopping festival, called \u201cSingles\u2019 Day\u201d, Mr Ma attempted to sell more lipstick in five minutes than Li Jiaqi, a live-streaming salesman known as the \u201cLipstick King\u201d. The king won.\nFive years on, Mr Li\u2019s crown has slipped a little. In September he lost his cool with an online commenter who questioned the price of an eyebrow pencil he was showcasing. \u201cHow is it expensive? It has been this price for years,\u201d Mr Li asked incredulously. \u201cMaybe you should look at yourself. Has your pay risen? Have you been working hard in these years?\u201d\nMr Li, who later apologised, had touched a nerve. He had also touched on one of China\u2019s deeper economic difficulties. It is hard for firms to increase prices when wage growth is weak.\n\nAlthough the unemployment rate in China\u2019s cities is only 5%, many households are not optimistic about their pay or their job prospects. According to the latest central-bank survey, more people expect their income to fall in the near future than to rise. Consumer confidence collapsed during the pandemic-related lockdowns of 2022. It has yet to recover (see chart). \nThe gloom is making customers picky and cost-conscious. In October China slipped into deflation, with consumer prices falling by 0.2% compared with a year earlier. People are not squandering money by redefining their eyebrows. During the Singles\u2019 Day festival\u2014which now runs from late October to November 11th\u2014spending on makeup and fragrance fell by 5.6%, according to Syntun, a data firm.\nThe e-commerce platforms did their best during the festival to appease, not insult, the price sensitivity of their customers. Pinduoduo offered merchants on its platform extensive subsidies to help them provide discounts to consumers. JD.com, the closest rival to Alibaba, promised to compensate customers if they found a cheaper price for a product within 30 days of buying it. Consumers are also becoming ruthlessly strategic. Some shoppers add a luxury item to their purchases so they can meet the minimum spending threshold for a discount on their bill. They then return the luxury item and keep the rest.\nThese marketing gambits have, it appears, boosted the volume of sales more than the value. The number of parcels delivered from November 1st to 11th rose by 23% year on year, according to the State Post Bureau. But the amount of spending on e-commerce platforms rose by less than 10%, according to most analysts.\nSpending is not universally weak. According to official figures released on November 15th, retail sales (both online and off) rose by 7.6% in October compared with a year earlier. That was faster than expected. Spending on restaurants, cars and phones made big contributions. Huawei\u2019s sales grew by 83%, according to Counterpoint, a research firm. That was thanks in large part to Huawei\u2019s new Mate 60 phones, which boast chips made in China.\nThe fastest-growing retail category was sports and entertainment products. Sales rose by nearly 30% compared with a year earlier. Lululemon, a maker of athletic wear, reported that its second-quarter revenue in greater China (including Taiwan) grew by 61% year on year. China also became the biggest market for Brompton, the British folding bike. \u201cPeople are willing to concentrate their budget on something which can actually make them feel happy,\u201d says Chen Luo of Bank of America.\nChinese consumers are not only investing in themselves. Spending on pet foods during this year\u2019s festival increased by almost 30%, according to Syntun. Young people who cannot imagine supporting a child instead lavish attention on their cats and dogs. This affection extends beyond food to fashion and gadgets. Mr Luo cites the example of \u201csmart\u201d cat litters, which help to remove bad smells.\nPets can also be used to market other items. In 2016 Mr Li became the owner of a fluffy Bichon Fris\u00e9, which he called \u201cNever\u201d. Together with her pups and grand-pups she has her own collective brand, \u201cNever\u2019s Family\u201d. But not everyone has been won over by Mr Li\u2019s pets\u2014or his tearful apology. For Halloween this year, at least one person dressed up as the Lipstick King, wearing a black top emblazoned with the question: How is it expensive? \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world.", "description": "They want to spend on pets and sports, not makeup or perfume", "ogDescription": "They want to spend on pets and sports, not makeup or perfume", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231118_CNP501.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-11-16T14:48:08Z", "dateModified": "2023-11-16T17:50:37Z", "dateCreated": "2023-11-15T14:17:28Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-11-18T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "HONG KONG", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/4i2obo29dkr1ds1bm5h0r6odhm77hi3i", "publication": [{"id": "/content/dnnng27usk166u2hs1rpqduevut9t8pb", "context": {"position": 900.44, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/bghaq0qhlet51vi9pijkmca3cln9gii2", "context": {"position": 900.44, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/5i4mcrqcru1bgfkfql9v4i7cp2v80jrv", "context": {"position": 445.44000000000005, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g0gsu834orc75fkruujrg99jblu321ri", "context": {"position": 900.44, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2vrtucvou6jk2a569o38lhfa4rum2eim", "context": {"position": 900.44, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/eid23grln72h6u7ov43tdoutnqu43k5n", "context": {"position": 900.44, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2uierc8hm4ofv4prp1p6n6ir0duh3i71", "context": {"position": 900.44, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/p4tokhnv1kv1d28l69v1vjva1neqjb9t", "context": {"position": 900.44, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "China\u2019s shoppers are gloomy and picky", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/16/chinas-shoppers-are-gloomy-and-picky", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/brvvc559nkc5f6svpgg3euramr3agac2", "publication": [{"id": "/content/dnnng27usk166u2hs1rpqduevut9t8pb", "context": {"position": 900.45, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/bghaq0qhlet51vi9pijkmca3cln9gii2", "context": {"position": 900.45, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/5i4mcrqcru1bgfkfql9v4i7cp2v80jrv", "context": {"position": 445.45000000000005, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g0gsu834orc75fkruujrg99jblu321ri", "context": {"position": 900.45, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2vrtucvou6jk2a569o38lhfa4rum2eim", "context": {"position": 900.45, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/eid23grln72h6u7ov43tdoutnqu43k5n", "context": {"position": 900.45, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2uierc8hm4ofv4prp1p6n6ir0duh3i71", "context": {"position": 900.45, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/p4tokhnv1kv1d28l69v1vjva1neqjb9t", "context": {"position": 900.45, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Xi Jinping repeats imperial China\u2019s mistakes", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/china/2023/11/16/xi-jinping-repeats-imperial-chinas-mistakes", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3hvjnvutpmmnglj7a9fq2pj3f1ln0048", "publication": [{"id": "/content/dnnng27usk166u2hs1rpqduevut9t8pb", "context": {"position": 900.43, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/bghaq0qhlet51vi9pijkmca3cln9gii2", "context": {"position": 900.43, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/5i4mcrqcru1bgfkfql9v4i7cp2v80jrv", "context": {"position": 445.42999999999995, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g0gsu834orc75fkruujrg99jblu321ri", "context": {"position": 900.43, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2vrtucvou6jk2a569o38lhfa4rum2eim", "context": {"position": 900.43, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/eid23grln72h6u7ov43tdoutnqu43k5n", "context": {"position": 900.43, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2uierc8hm4ofv4prp1p6n6ir0duh3i71", "context": {"position": 900.43, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/p4tokhnv1kv1d28l69v1vjva1neqjb9t", "context": {"position": 900.43, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Joe Biden and Xi Jinping rediscover the joy of talking.
