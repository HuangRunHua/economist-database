Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, reckons Japan has \u201cconvincingly emerged from three decades of economic stagnation\u201d. Warren Buffett has built up large holdings in five Japanese trading houses. Earlier this year, the benchmark Nikkei stock index hit its highest level since the bubble burst. \u201cJapan is undergoing a series of extraordinary economic transformations,\u201d gushed Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, an asset-management firm, while in Tokyo in October. \nThe past 30 years have seen many false dawns in Japan. There are reasons for scepticism this time, too. Japan\u2019s post-pandemic recovery remains fragile: after growing 4.5% year-on-year in the second quarter, GDP contracted by 2.1% in the third quarter, according to data released on November 15th. Wages have not kept pace with price increases. Consumption is flat. The yen\u2019s depreciation led the International Monetary Fund to project that Japan\u2019s nominal GDP in dollar terms will slip this year from third largest to fourth in the world, behind America, China and Germany. \nServicing Japan\u2019s massive government debt is already a heavy burden. It will become more of one if the Bank of Japan (BoJ) moves away from its ultra-loose policy based on negative interest rates and yield-curve control, as it hints it may do next year. Many firms that rely on interest-free capital would struggle to stay solvent, too.\nJapan\u2019s workforce is still shrinking and ageing. Its firms continue to hoard cash. Over 40% of firms listed on Japan\u2019s TOPIX 500 trade below book value, compared with under 5% on America\u2019s S&P 500. Foreign-investor interest has as much to do with Japan\u2019s relative stability and cheap currency as excitement about new growth.\nYet those familiar flaws obscure other developments. In recent decades \u201cthe fundamental problem of the Japanese economy was dynamism,\u201d says Hoshi Takeo of the University of Tokyo. Too few new companies were formed, too many old ones hung around, prices barely changed and talent was trapped within firms for life. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing that begin to change.\u201d \n Inflating hopes\n\nStart with prices. Headline annual inflation has been above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for 18 straight months. Even if much of that is due to higher import costs the psychology of price-setting is changing as a result. Firms have been forced to test the long-held assumption that pushing up prices would mean losing customers. \u201cWe came to understand we can raise prices,\u201d says Niinami Takeshi, the CEO of Suntory, a big drinks maker, and the chair of Keizai Doyukai, an influential association of corporate executives. The practice has become widespread: prices for nearly 90% of items monitored by the BoJ are rising (see chart).\nDemographic opportunity\nHigher inflation has outsized implications for wages, which have stagnated for decades. Inflation of 1% in Japan produces wage growth of just 0.2%, but the sensitivity jumps when inflation exceeds 2%, reckons Ota Tomohiro of Goldman Sachs. Demographic change ought to provide another push. Though Japan\u2019s population started shrinking more than a decade ago, women and old people entering the workforce largely offset the decline. But that trend has slowed in recent years, leaving employers feeling the crunch and needing to entice workers with higher pay. Though wage growth still lags price growth, if next year\u2019s annual shunto wage negotiations produce big gains again, a long-awaited virtuous cycle of price and wage growth would be tantalisingly close.\nGeopolitical turbulence, from war in Ukraine to tension between America, Japan\u2019s security provider, and China, its largest trading partner, has also changed the landscape for Japan Inc. A growing number of executives recognise that \u201cwe can\u2019t keep the status quo,\u201d says Mr Niinami. As firms prioritise supply-chain resilience and worry about location risk, Japan stands to benefit. Even if manufacturers do not build factories in Japan, they may rely on its factory-automation firms to help build them elsewhere. America once perceived Japan as an economic rival, yet it now wants to see Japan thrive. American officials cheered as IBM, an American tech giant, entered into a joint venture with Japanese counterparts to design chips in Japan. \nJapanese firms are poised to put their cash to use. The growth rate for planned capital investments is at its highest level since the BoJ began collecting survey data in 1983. The government is encouraging this trend: big subsidies have gone to the semiconductor industry; the government has pledged to spend 2trn yen ($13.2bn), or 0.3% of GDP, per year for the next decade to fuel the green transition. With defence spending set to rise substantially, officials want to spur defence-industrial-driven innovation of a kind that was formerly taboo. \nCorporate-governance reforms that began over a decade ago have become entrenched. Pressure to enhance corporate value and return on equity no longer comes solely from foreign activists\u2014Japanese institutional investors are also pushing. The pressure will increase. The government announced an \u201casset-doubling plan\u201d that seeks to encourage Japanese savers to invest their cash holdings, with tax incentives set to come into effect next year. The JPX, which oversees the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is another force for change under its new president, Yamaji Hiromi. Beginning next year, the bourse plans to publish a list of firms that meet corporate-governance guidelines. Mr Yamaji says that when CEOs approach him at the golf club to grumble, he answers: \u201cGood luck.\u201d \nThese shifts have coincided with generational change in Japanese business. The average age of CEOs at firms in the Nikkei stock index has dropped by 12 years in a decade, according to Jesper Koll of Monex Group, a brokerage. Many are moving beyond old mores such as lifetime employment and seniority-based pay. Young Japanese are happy to switch jobs. The best and brightest increasingly join or start new firms. \u201cWe should be betting on these groups of people,\u201d says Namba Tomoko, a vice-chair of Keidanren, a business group. \nThe startup ecosystem is small relative to Japan\u2019s gDP, yet increasingly vibrant. \u201cThe old Japan is still there, but in parallel to that a new Japan coexists and grows,\u201d says Kushida Kenji of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank. Investment in startups rose from 88bn yen in 2013 to 877bn yen in 2022; the number of Japanese venture-capital funds has quadrupled in that time. \nWhere many Japanese entrepreneurs were once content to be big in Japan, a new class of founders with global ambitions is rising. Shin Taejun, founder of Gojo, a microfinance firm, wants it to be \u201cthe World Bank of the private sector\u201d. Maeda Yosuke, founder of Wota, which builds decentralised water-treatment infrastructure, aspires to \u201csolve the global water crisis\u201d. Rather than inheriting his family\u2019s construction firm, he decided to build his own. \u201cThe old industrial structure can\u2019t solve the problems we want to solve,\u201d he says. Okada Nobu, founder of Astroscale, is leading global efforts to clean up debris in outer space. Japan needs new \u201cchampions\u201d, Mr Okada says. \u201cWe still refer to Sony and Honda\u2014let\u2019s forget about them.\u201d\nThis new generation also seeks to reshape corporate culture. Many young Japanese want to shed the post-war model based on lifetime employment, male domination and age-based hierarchies, says Takeshita Ryuichiro of Pivot, a media startup that focuses on the new Japan Inc. \u201cChange used to be seen as negative or traitorous,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we aim to portray pivot or change as positive.\u201d In just over a year Pivot has racked up over 1m subscribers on YouTube, where it broadcasts interviews with founders, investors and inventors. \nMany Japanese executives and policymakers seem not only to understand that Japan stands at a significant juncture; they are determined to make the most of it. \u201cPeople who know Japan really well ask me, is this time different?\u201d Mr Yamaji says. \u201cMy answer is it could be\u2014we should make it be.\u201d The opportunity may not present itself again soon. Unlike the sun, Japan\u2019s chance to rise does not come every day. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "A chance to rise again", "section": {"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Asia"}, "__typename": "Print"}, "articleSection": {"public": null, "internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/rs4nm4v2h4rdrnt5hrncvqkmtr2sbrr4", "tegID": "rs4nm4v2h4rdrnt5hrncvqkmtr2sbrr4", "headline": "Asia", "hasPart": {"parts": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/16/myanmars-junta-suffers-startling-defeats", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "id": "/content/bvofiu7qnv3i1nlo3cog7d1bu837lh60", "type": ["Article", "NewsArticle", "AnalysisNewsArticle"], "contentIdentity": {"mediaType": null, "__typename": "ContentIdentity"}, "articleSection": {"internal": [{"url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "headline": "Asia", "tegID": "rs4nm4v2h4rdrnt5hrncvqkmtr2sbrr4"}], "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "publication": [{"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 18TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-11-18", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "dnnng27usk166u2hs1rpqduevut9t8pb"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 18TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/eu/printedition/2023-11-18", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "bghaq0qhlet51vi9pijkmca3cln9gii2"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 18TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/ap/printedition/2023-11-18", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "5i4mcrqcru1bgfkfql9v4i7cp2v80jrv"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 18TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/la/printedition/2023-11-18", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "g0gsu834orc75fkruujrg99jblu321ri"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 18TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/me/printedition/2023-11-18", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "2vrtucvou6jk2a569o38lhfa4rum2eim"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 18TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/uk/printedition/2023-11-18", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "eid23grln72h6u7ov43tdoutnqu43k5n"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 18TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/na/printedition/2023-11-18", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "2uierc8hm4ofv4prp1p6n6ir0duh3i71"}, {"headline": "WEEKLY EDITION: NOV 18TH 2023", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/a/printedition/2023-11-18", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content", "tegID": "p4tokhnv1kv1d28l69v1vjva1neqjb9t"}], "channel": {"tegID": "j53t6hsedat4l7rkbb1le98u73262sh5", "__typename": "Content"}, "headline": "Myanmar\u2019s junta suffers startling defeats", "subheadline": "Banyan", "datePublished": "2023-11-16T14:48:08Z", "description": "The armed opposition is growing more unified.

At that time, an asset bubble burst and the sun set on the model that had helped Japan grow rapidly. Though the country remained rich, it slid into deflation and its growth rate slowed. Aoki reckoned generational change would be necessary for a new model to coalesce. He started the clock at the moment the bubble had definitively burst and the long-time ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party, first lost power: the year of 1993. \nFast forward to 2023 and Aoki\u2019s words ring prophetic. The world\u2019s third-largest economy is awakening from its decades-long torpor. After years of deflation or low inflation, Japan is seeing its fastest price growth in more than 30 years. Wages, long stagnant, are rising faster than at any time since the 1990s. Both increases are driven largely by global supply shocks. But they are not the only changes afoot. As Aoki predicted, gradual institutional and generational shifts are bearing fruit and changing Japan Inc from within.\n Struggling to keep up\n\nThis confluence of external shocks and internal evolution represents a chance for Japan to change its economic trajectory. The country\u2019s share of global GDP in PPP terms has fallen from 9% in 1990 to under 4% today; its GDP per person in PPP terms slid from 81% of America\u2019s level to 64% over the same period (see chart). Goldman Sachs, a bank, projects that Japan will drop out of the top five economies by 2050 and out of the top ten by 2075. A shrinking population limits the upsides to its growth. Even so, if Japan can reset inflation expectations, boost productivity and unleash corporate dynamism, its fall from the top league could perhaps be halted. \nInvestors are excited. Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, reckons Japan has \u201cconvincingly emerged from three decades of economic stagnation\u201d. Warren Buffett has built up large holdings in five Japanese trading houses. Earlier this year, the benchmark Nikkei stock index hit its highest level since the bubble burst. \u201cJapan is undergoing a series of extraordinary economic transformations,\u201d gushed Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, an asset-management firm, while in Tokyo in October. \nThe past 30 years have seen many false dawns in Japan. There are reasons for scepticism this time, too. Japan\u2019s post-pandemic recovery remains fragile: after growing 4.5% year-on-year in the second quarter, GDP contracted by 2.1% in the third quarter, according to data released on November 15th. Wages have not kept pace with price increases. Consumption is flat. The yen\u2019s depreciation led the International Monetary Fund to project that Japan\u2019s nominal GDP in dollar terms will slip this year from third largest to fourth in the world, behind America, China and Germany. \nServicing Japan\u2019s massive government debt is already a heavy burden. It will become more of one if the Bank of Japan (BoJ) moves away from its ultra-loose policy based on negative interest rates and yield-curve control, as it hints it may do next year. Many firms that rely on interest-free capital would struggle to stay solvent, too.\nJapan\u2019s workforce is still shrinking and ageing. Its firms continue to hoard cash. Over 40% of firms listed on Japan\u2019s TOPIX 500 trade below book value, compared with under 5% on America\u2019s S&P 500. Foreign-investor interest has as much to do with Japan\u2019s relative stability and cheap currency as excitement about new growth.\nYet those familiar flaws obscure other developments. In recent decades \u201cthe fundamental problem of the Japanese economy was dynamism,\u201d says Hoshi Takeo of the University of Tokyo. Too few new companies were formed, too many old ones hung around, prices barely changed and talent was trapped within firms for life. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing that begin to change.\u201d \n Inflating hopes\n\nStart with prices. Headline annual inflation has been above the BoJ\u2019s 2% target for 18 straight months. Even if much of that is due to higher import costs the psychology of price-setting is changing as a result. Firms have been forced to test the long-held assumption that pushing up prices would mean losing customers. \u201cWe came to understand we can raise prices,\u201d says Niinami Takeshi, the CEO of Suntory, a big drinks maker, and the chair of Keizai Doyukai, an influential association of corporate executives. The practice has become widespread: prices for nearly 90% of items monitored by the BoJ are rising (see chart).\nDemographic opportunity\nHigher inflation has outsized implications for wages, which have stagnated for decades. Inflation of 1% in Japan produces wage growth of just 0.2%, but the sensitivity jumps when inflation exceeds 2%, reckons Ota Tomohiro of Goldman Sachs. Demographic change ought to provide another push. Though Japan\u2019s population started shrinking more than a decade ago, women and old people entering the workforce largely offset the decline. But that trend has slowed in recent years, leaving employers feeling the crunch and needing to entice workers with higher pay. Though wage growth still lags price growth, if next year\u2019s annual shunto wage negotiations produce big gains again, a long-awaited virtuous cycle of price and wage growth would be tantalisingly close.\nGeopolitical turbulence, from war in Ukraine to tension between America, Japan\u2019s security provider, and China, its largest trading partner, has also changed the landscape for Japan Inc. A growing number of executives recognise that \u201cwe can\u2019t keep the status quo,\u201d says Mr Niinami. As firms prioritise supply-chain resilience and worry about location risk, Japan stands to benefit. Even if manufacturers do not build factories in Japan, they may rely on its factory-automation firms to help build them elsewhere. America once perceived Japan as an economic rival, yet it now wants to see Japan thrive. American officials cheered as IBM, an American tech giant, entered into a joint venture with Japanese counterparts to design chips in Japan. \nJapanese firms are poised to put their cash to use. The growth rate for planned capital investments is at its highest level since the BoJ began collecting survey data in 1983. The government is encouraging this trend: big subsidies have gone to the semiconductor industry; the government has pledged to spend 2trn yen ($13.2bn), or 0.3% of GDP, per year for the next decade to fuel the green transition. With defence spending set to rise substantially, officials want to spur defence-industrial-driven innovation of a kind that was formerly taboo. \nCorporate-governance reforms that began over a decade ago have become entrenched. Pressure to enhance corporate value and return on equity no longer comes solely from foreign activists\u2014Japanese institutional investors are also pushing. The pressure will increase. The government announced an \u201casset-doubling plan\u201d that seeks to encourage Japanese savers to invest their cash holdings, with tax incentives set to come into effect next year. The JPX, which oversees the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is another force for change under its new president, Yamaji Hiromi. Beginning next year, the bourse plans to publish a list of firms that meet corporate-governance guidelines. Mr Yamaji says that when CEOs approach him at the golf club to grumble, he answers: \u201cGood luck.\u201d \nThese shifts have coincided with generational change in Japanese business. The average age of CEOs at firms in the Nikkei stock index has dropped by 12 years in a decade, according to Jesper Koll of Monex Group, a brokerage. Many are moving beyond old mores such as lifetime employment and seniority-based pay. Young Japanese are happy to switch jobs. The best and brightest increasingly join or start new firms. \u201cWe should be betting on these groups of people,\u201d says Namba Tomoko, a vice-chair of Keidanren, a business group. \nThe startup ecosystem is small relative to Japan\u2019s gDP, yet increasingly vibrant. \u201cThe old Japan is still there, but in parallel to that a new Japan coexists and grows,\u201d says Kushida Kenji of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank. Investment in startups rose from 88bn yen in 2013 to 877bn yen in 2022; the number of Japanese venture-capital funds has quadrupled in that time. \nWhere many Japanese entrepreneurs were once content to be big in Japan, a new class of founders with global ambitions is rising. Shin Taejun, founder of Gojo, a microfinance firm, wants it to be \u201cthe World Bank of the private sector\u201d. Maeda Yosuke, founder of Wota, which builds decentralised water-treatment infrastructure, aspires to \u201csolve the global water crisis\u201d. Rather than inheriting his family\u2019s construction firm, he decided to build his own. \u201cThe old industrial structure can\u2019t solve the problems we want to solve,\u201d he says. Okada Nobu, founder of Astroscale, is leading global efforts to clean up debris in outer space. Japan needs new \u201cchampions\u201d, Mr Okada says. \u201cWe still refer to Sony and Honda\u2014let\u2019s forget about them.\u201d\nThis new generation also seeks to reshape corporate culture. Many young Japanese want to shed the post-war model based on lifetime employment, male domination and age-based hierarchies, says Takeshita Ryuichiro of Pivot, a media startup that focuses on the new Japan Inc. \u201cChange used to be seen as negative or traitorous,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we aim to portray pivot or change as positive.\u201d In just over a year Pivot has racked up over 1m subscribers on YouTube, where it broadcasts interviews with founders, investors and inventors. \nMany Japanese executives and policymakers seem not only to understand that Japan stands at a significant juncture; they are determined to make the most of it. \u201cPeople who know Japan really well ask me, is this time different?\u201d Mr Yamaji says. \u201cMy answer is it could be\u2014we should make it be.\u201d The opportunity may not present itself again soon. Unlike the sun, Japan\u2019s chance to rise does not come every day. \u25a0", "description": "Wage and price inflation is coinciding with an exciting corporate renewal", "ogDescription": "Wage and
