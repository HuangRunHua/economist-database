"https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/15/ridley-scotts-napoleon-cuts-the-emperor-down-to-size", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Two versions of Napoleon Bonaparte crop up on screen. The first is a titan of history who marches vast armies across Europe, forging his own destiny and the continent\u2019s. This is the figure with whom men of a certain age and type are often fascinated\u2014such as would-be statesman Connor Roy, who in the TV show \u201cSuccession\u201d tries to buy Napoleon\u2019s shrivelled penis at auction.\nThe second Napoleon appears in cartoons and comedies in a bicorne hat. He is touchy about his height (in reality, average for his era) and talks in a pantomime French accent (the actual Napoleon had a Corsican twang). One version casts him as an embodiment of martial power; the other lampoons it.\nYou might expect the hero of \u201cNapoleon\u201d, a lavish film directed by Sir Ridley Scott and released on November 22nd, to stand firmly in the potentate camp. Oddly, he has a foot in both. The misfiring movie is a case study in handling two big challenges of biopics, one perennial, the other especially acute now: how to shape a luminary\u2019s life into a story, and how to judge and depict his flaws.\nThe real Napoleon\u2014a general by 24, emperor at 35\u2014lived on fast-forward. Sir Ridley packs lots of the highs and lows into a two-and-a-half-hour extravaganza: victory at Austerlitz, calamity in Russia and the finale at Waterloo, where a vanquished Napoleon (played by Joaquin Phoenix) is doomed to exile (again). He weaves the triumphs and disasters into a chronicle of Napoleon\u2019s passion for Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, his first wife.\nIt\u2019s grisly stuff\u2014and that\u2019s just the love affair. This emperor is not like Marlon Brando\u2019s, the suavest to don the familiar greatcoat, in his case for \u201cD\u00e9sir\u00e9e\u201d (1954), which chronicles Napoleon\u2019s passion for, er, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary, briefly his fianc\u00e9e. Instead he is a gauche oddball. Looking distinctly wizened for a 26-year-old (Mr Phoenix is 49), he runs into Jos\u00e9phine (Vanessa Kirby), fresh out of a Jacobin prison, at a louche ball in 1795. Along with their skimpy bodices, the ladies wear red ribbons around their necks in a ghoulish nod to the guillotine.\n\u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d she asks him. Romance-wise, it\u2019s downhill from there. Napoleon is a selfish, perfunctory lover, and both have affairs. \u201cYou are empty,\u201d he bawls at Jos\u00e9phine at a formal dinner, angry at her failure to give him an heir. \u201cAnd you are fat,\u201d she volleys back. Then they throw food at each other.\nThe battles are pretty nasty, too. When the foes of France plunge through the ice at Austerlitz, the underwater shots are bloody yet balletic, as memorable in their way as the scenes of carnage in Sergei Bondarchuk\u2019s \u201cWaterloo\u201d (1970). The real-life Napoleon did not spare the horses, and neither does Sir Ridley. If you were squeamish about Russell Crowe\u2019s tussle with a tiger in \u201cGladiator\u201d, another of the director\u2019s sword-and-soundbite epics, you will not like what a cannonball does to Napoleon\u2019s mount at the siege of Toulon. A closing note estimates that his wars cost 3m human lives.\nThe film glosses over Napoleon\u2019s industrial-scale looting and habit of skedaddling when his armies got into bother. Still, Sir Ridley\u2019s verdict on his subject, as both husband and leader, is cutting. To Napoleon\u2019s defenders, he was a fiery champion of the Enlightenment and a swooning romantic. In this incarnation he is a warmonger and a pig. \nThe harsh judgment, however, is not what hobbles the movie. Good films can be made about bad people. The problem lies in Sir Ridley\u2019s answer to the other challenge of biopics, namely how to edit such an overstuffed life for the screen.\nAmong his omissions is: why? His malignant Napoleon is shorn of mystique, but his motivation is a mystery, beside a hint of sexual neurosis, some mummy issues and the odd mean remark about Corsicans. The same goes for his appeal, to both Jos\u00e9phine and his followers. His laws and reforms\u2014a figleaf for conquest or an enduring legacy, depending on your view\u2014are neglected. As a statesman he is crass and petulant. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so great because you have boats!\u201d he yelps at the British.\nBiopics, like statues, are both homages to historical figures and an argument about history itself. Implicitly they claim that some individuals shape the world rather than the other way round. Napoleon did that as much as anyone; yet because Sir Ridley prefers events to explanation, his hero is a slight man in a big film. For all his derring-do, he has a whiff of the grouchy Napoleon in \u201cBill and Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure\u201d (1989), who is teleported to modern America, hogs the ice-cream and cheats at ten-pin bowling.\u25a0\nRead more from Back Story, our column on culture:\n\u201cKing Lear\u201d and the purpose of tragedy in dark times (Nov 1st)\nDavid Beckham\u2019s guide to celebrity (Oct
