Some American officials want their law-enforcement and intelligence agencies to take a closer look at Russia\u2019s links to corrupt South African elites. Western governments are pondering whether to warn Mr Ramaphosa about the consequences should he attend a Russia-Africa summit due later this year. \nThe tragedy is that South Africa needs all the help it can get. It is not the singular sub-Saharan African power it was in the 2000s. Nor has it gone unnoticed that the country is falling apart. There are rolling blackouts and the taps are regularly dry: when Janet Yellen, America\u2019s treasury secretary, visited last month water tanks had to be delivered to where she was staying because the water was off. Organised crime is rampant. Yet just when it should be drawing closer to its main sources of trade and investment, it is veering away. To friends in the West, South Africa\u2019s pretensions to global importance look increasingly ridiculous. Its sympathy for Russia only makes it more so. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Not so neutral", "section": {"url": {"canonical":

Its fleet spends less than half the time on the seas that it did a decade ago. It has few working ships, a result of budget cuts by the ruling African National Congress (anc). So it makes sense that the country would welcome better fleets that might teach it a thing or two. \nBut the hosting of Russian and Chinese navies for exercises from February 17th-27th is not just a chance for sailors to salute each other. Coinciding with the one-year anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the operations underline how the anc government, despite claiming to be neutral over the conflict, is drifting into the Sino-Russian orbit, partly by choice. The West\u2019s resulting frustrations with South Africa show that mid-ranking countries claiming to be \u201cnon-aligned\u201d today are often performing a tricky balancing act.\nThe anc has long had a soft spot for Russia. Party stalwarts such as Naledi Pandor, South Africa\u2019s foreign minister, are fond of telling Western diplomats how the Soviet Union supported the anti-apartheid struggle. (Ukraine, also once part of the Soviet Union, never receives much thanks.) When Ms Pandor met Josep Borrell, the eu foreign-policy chief, in late January, she said that the West had no lessons to offer South Africa because the West never gave weapons to those fighting for freedom from white rule, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting. Russia also matters for pragmatic reasons; China even more so. In 2010 South Africa became the s in the brics, a group of big emerging markets. Membership matters to South Africa, by far the smallest economy in the bloc, because it gives it a seat at a table with powerful countries. \nFor most of the 21st century the West has been understanding of South Africa\u2019s desire to have it both ways. Guilt over their initial acquiescence to apartheid tempered rich countries\u2019 criticism of the anc. South Africa was the gateway to the rest of the continent. As long as it was open to trade, investment and tourists from America and Europe, the anc was given a pass. Western countries still represent four of the five top destinations for South African exports. They also account for most of the country\u2019s foreign direct investment and international holdings of South African assets. \nBut the war in Ukraine has drawn attention to South Africa\u2019s ostensible non-alignment. Last March it was one of 26 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries that failed to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion at the un General Assembly. That irked but did not surprise Western diplomats.  On average South Africa echoed only 23% of America\u2019s votes annually between 2017 and 2021, according to analysis by The Economist. That was ten percentage points lower than the average for all countries\u2014almost as divergent as nations such as Cuba and Zimbabwe. South Africa was among the minority of un members that did not condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea in 2014. Public opinion is different: most South Africans seem to disapprove of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine. \nSouth Africa\u2019s abstention in October 2022, on whether to condemn Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukrainian territory, caused greater frustration in the West. A month earlier Cyril Ramaphosa had become the first head of state to receive a private tour of the White House from Joe Biden\u2014a sign of America\u2019s efforts to woo South Africa. Weeks later Mr Ramaphosa would become the first to conduct a state visit to Britain under King Charles III. Western diplomats say they consulted the South Africans on the text of the un resolution but ultimately Mr Ramaphosa overruled his diplomats and abstained. (His spokesperson declined to comment.) Charm offensives appear to be no match for real Russian ones. \nChoppier waters\nMr Ramaphosa was given the benefit of the doubt. He had an internal anc election to win in December, and needed to keep pro-Russian party members happy. But then in November a superyacht owned by a sanctioned Russian businessman was reported to be heading to Cape Town (in the end it opted for the Maldives). More disturbingly, later that month, a Russian merchant ship subject to us sanctions for its alleged role in carrying materiel was spotted in South African waters. The ship, known as Lady R, turned its tracking device off before docking at a naval base in early December. Eye-witnesses reported cargo being offloaded under the cover of darkness. Diplomatic sources worry that further materiel may have been put on the ship afterwards. Thandi Modise, the defence minister, has not given a full account of events, saying only that the ship was bringing an order of ammunition placed before the pandemic. \u201cWe remain unsatisfied,\u201d says a Western diplomat. (A spokesperson for Ms Modise did not respond to requests for comment.) \nThen, in January, came the visit of Sergei Lavrov. Alongside her Russian counterpart, Ms Pandor said that calling for Russia\u2019s withdrawal from Ukraine would be \u201csimplistic and infantile\u201d given the \u201cmassive transfer of arms\u201d that the West had given Kyiv. She also said the brics bloc should be part of \u201ca redesigned global order\u201d\u2014to Russian and Chinese delight.\nNow there are the naval exercises. South Africa hosted Russia and China in 2019 to less outcry. It co-operates with Western navies, including France\u2019s, and regularly welcomes Western politicians. But hosting a Russian ship emblazoned with the pro-war \u201cZ\u201d logo at a time when Vladimir Putin\u2019s troops are slaughtering Ukrainians on the battlefield marks a shift.\nThe government\u2019s actions are drawing attention to the links between individual anc politicians and Russia. In 2021 David Mabuza, the deputy president, spent more than a month in Russia for a \u201cscheduled medical consultation\u201d. Ms Modise, a rare female guerrilla for the anc\u2019s armed wing during the struggle, attended a security summit in Moscow in August with defence ministers from 34 other countries. Western diplomats see engaging with her as a lost cause. There are echoes, notes one, of Russia\u2019s modus operandi in more fragile African countries, such as Mali and the Central African Republic, where the Wagner Group of mercenaries is propping up regimes. Russia cannot match the West\u2019s economic importance to South Africa, but it can try to pick off pliant elites, especially those with anti-Western sympathies.\nThe West is still figuring out how to respond to the anc\u2019s pro-Russian moves. Some officials worry that speaking out or issuing threats will push anc politicians further eastward. Diplomats note that in South Africa, what can seem like conspiracy is often cock-up. Ministries are siloed; the foreign ministry was unaware of the arrival of Lady R.  But officials on the ground all agree that defending a softly-softly approach to the anc government to their respective capitals is becoming harder.  \nSome in the West favour a tougher line. American senators are privately asking why South Africa should have preferential trade terms with the United States, as it does through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, when it is de facto supporting a wartime enemy. Some American officials want their law-enforcement and intelligence agencies to take a closer look at Russia\u2019s links to corrupt South African elites. Western governments are pondering whether to warn Mr Ramaphosa about the consequences should he attend a Russia-Africa summit due later this year. \nThe tragedy is that South Africa needs all the help it can get. It is not the singular sub-Saharan African power it was in the 2000s. Nor has it gone unnoticed that the country is falling apart. There are rolling blackouts and the taps are regularly dry: when Janet Yellen, America\u2019s treasury secretary, visited last month water tanks had to be delivered to where she was staying because the water was off. Organised crime is rampant. Yet just when it should be drawing closer to its main sources of trade and investment, it is veering away. To friends in the West, South Africa\u2019s pretensions to global importance look increasingly ridiculous. Its sympathy for Russia only makes it more so. \u25a0", "description": "The ANC elite is full of Russian sympathisers", "ogDescription": "The ANC elite is full of Russian sympathisers", "imageUrl":
