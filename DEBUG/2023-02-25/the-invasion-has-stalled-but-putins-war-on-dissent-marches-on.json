Their exodus, and the ruinous effect it is likely to have on Russia\u2019s future, is the subject of a new Economist podcast, \u201cNext Year in Moscow\u201d.  We spoke to dozens of exiles in Britain, Georgia, Turkey and elsewhere\u2014and many people who stayed in Russia. Their stories help explain why Mr Putin started this devastating war and how it will change their country.\n\nExiles like Mr Sverdlin are not the only Russians to have lost their place in society. Some 20,000 have been arrested since the start of the war for protesting against it. The police have even detained people laying flowers by statues of historic figures of Ukrainian origin, since they see the gesture (rightly) as an implicit rebuke. Alexei Navalny, a jailed opposition leader, has been moved to solitary confinement. Prosecutors are preparing a new political show trial for him. \n\nWhat is more, the few remaining institutions that criticise the government or advocate a more liberal society have disappeared. The legal restrictions Mr Putin\u2019s regime has imposed on discussing the war\u2014or even calling it that\u2014have forced the closure of all independent media outlets, including Echo of Moscow, a radio station, and TV Rain, a television channel (both now broadcast from outside Russia). The Moscow Helsinki Group, which campaigns for human rights, has been shut down. Another such outfit, the Andrei Sakharov Centre, is being evicted from its premises. \nDaniel Treisman of the University of California argues that these people and institutions are not accidental victims of the war, but one of its main targets. Ukraine, after all, posed no military threat to Russia. And a vast and sparsely populated country, spanning 11 time zones, could scarcely be said to need more territory.  Rather, it was the gradual emergence in Ukraine of a vigorous civil society that successfully demanded reform of the state, and the inklings of a similar process in Russia, that Mr Putin found threatening.  \nBefore the tanks rolled into Ukraine, Mr Treisman notes, liberal values were spreading fast in Russia. The share of people who told pollsters that freedom of speech was important to them rose from 34% in 2017 to 61% in 2021. Use of the internet was rising rapidly (see chart 2); record numbers were watching Mr Navalny\u2019s YouTube channel. Meanwhile, television viewing, the government\u2019s main tool for shaping Russians\u2019 outlook, was in sharp decline. \nThe shift is largely generational. People born during Russia\u2019s liberalisation in the 1990s tend to be more enterprising than their elders, less prone to rely on the state and more liberal on matters such as gay rights. In 2017 some 70% of older Russians told the Levada Centre, a polling group, that they could not survive without the government\u2019s help, whereas only 27% of people under 35 felt the same. And in 2020, despite the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda, some 60% of young Russians told Levada that they had a positive view of America.  \n\u201cPutin and his crew understood that time was working against them, because the young generation is not interested in their tv propaganda and does not believe that Russia is a besieged fortress encircled by enemies, or that the United States wants to conquer us,\u201d says Mr Sverdlin. This week Mr Navalny echoed that sentiment in a statement conveyed from his prison cell by his lawyers. Alexander Gabuev, who worked for a think-tank in Moscow forced to close last year, laments, \u201cThis is a war against Russia\u2019s future\u2026And Russia\u2019s future will now be very different, regardless of the outcome of the war, from the one it might have been had February 24th not happened.\u201d \nFor one thing, the 500,000 people who have fled are among Russia\u2019s best educated and most dynamic. They may not have had any say in politics even before the war, but their voices were nonetheless audible. No longer. Political debate, to the extent there is any in Russia now, occurs not between those who oppose the war and those who support it, but between \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cturbo-patriots\u201d, who criticise Russian commanders for not being brutal and aggressive enough.  \nBy amplifying pro-war voices and silencing common sense, Mr Putin has achieved an illusion of total support for the war. People are wary of expressing criticism of it in any form but, even so, some 20% of Russians tell pollsters they are against it. It is safe to assume that disquiet is far more widespread than that. \u201cPutin has managed to persuade the minority that it represents a majority, and the majority that it is a minority,\u201d  says Leonid Volkov, Mr Navalny\u2019s chief of staff.\nPolling conducted by Mr Navalny\u2019s team, which operates from outside Russia, suggests that even among supporters of the war confidence in Mr Putin\u2019s wisdom is fast evaporating. Since the summer, the share of people who think that the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d is going as planned has declined from 40% to about 15%. This is hardly surprising, given the rising death toll. In October 6% of Russians said they knew someone who had been killed in the war; by January that figure had doubled. Two-thirds of Russians know someone who has been mobilised or is fighting in the war. \nIn a recent interview Oscar Kuchera, an actor and television host, neatly captured the inchoate views about Ukraine that are typical of many Russians. He simultaneously displayed confusion about the purpose of the war, misgivings about its progress, and ardent support for Mr Putin and \u201cour boys\u201d on the front line. The idea of annexing Ukrainian territory is especially puzzling to him: \u201cDon\u2019t we have enough problems of our own without having to feed someone else?\u201d he asked. But he insisted that Mr Putin must have good reasons for his land grab, even if a simple man like himself could not fully understand them. \nPocketbook patriots\nThe idea that things are under control is bolstered by the stability of the economy. On the surface, Moscow looks much as it did before the war. Some popular Western brands\u2014McDonald\u2019s, IKEA\u2014have disappeared and some martial symbols have materialised. The economy contracted by a little over 2% last year, with the harm inflicted by sanctions largely offset by the benefit of massive export earnings thanks to high prices for oil and gas (see chart 4). Those were equivalent to about $230bn (10% of GDP), according to Re: Russia, a research network, almost compensating for the $275bn of capital that fled the country. The bonanza has allowed the government to boost its spending by a quarter, injecting an extra 5.5trn roubles ($74bn) into the economy. That will only reinforce the state\u2019s growing hold over the economy (see chart 3).\nMonthly output in some import-dependent and consumer-facing industries, such as cars and pharmaceuticals, was 50% lower by the end of 2022 than at the beginning. But arms manufacturing, naturally, has boomed. Tatarstan has seen a joint venture to make Ford cars shut down, but expects a factory to make military drones in collaboration with Iran to open soon.\n\nA lower oil price and sharply reduced sales of gas are likely to lead to a budget crunch this year. In the long run, the exodus of skilled workers will harm the economy. Since the start of the war Russia is estimated to have lost at least 100,000 it specialists. But the bureaucracy has done a good job of adapting to the new circumstances, blunting the immediate impact of the brain-drain and sanctions.  \u201cThey see this as a quest,\u201d says Mikhail Komin, a political scientist who had surveyed middle-level technocrats.  \u201cThey feel as much in demand as the military themselves\u201d. \nIn fact, the war has raised the status of technocrats, and of the army and security services even more so. The government wants to expand the army from its current 1m soldiers to 1.5m. That is 4% of the male, working-age population, a higher share than in any other country bar North Korea. A third of the national budget goes to men in uniform. Spending on the armed forces this year has been revised up by 40% compared with pre-war plans. Spending on domestic security\u2014the machinery of repression\u2014is up by over 50% (see chart 5). Meanwhile, spending on health care has fallen by 9%. To further exalt men in uniform, the government plans to reserve seats in the Duma, Russia\u2019s docile parliament, for \u201cmilitary patriots\u201d.  \nCulture and education have also been \u201cmobilised\u201d. Actors and artists who have decried the war have been expelled from state-funded theatres. The latest victim is Liya Akhedzhakova, a famous actress who has been pushed out of the Sovremennik Theatre after 45 years. Zelfira Tregulova, the director of the Tretyakov Gallery, which houses the country\u2019s biggest collection of Russian art, was dismissed for deviating from the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cspiritual and moral values\u201d.  Her replacement is the daughter of a senior officer in the security services.\nIn short, even though the material impact of the war is scant in much of Russia, the conflict is inescapable. \u201cPutin\u2019s purpose in this war is to  achieve a radical break from the West and thus maintain control over Russian society by moving it into a state of permanent struggle and mobilisation,\u201d says Kirill Rogov, the founder of Re: Russia. Any lack of progress on the battlefield is likely to be compensated for by ever-growing repression and purges, particularly as success becomes more elusive and casualties mount. \nRussians who used to look to Europe for modernisation have been cut off from it, rather as when Stalin tightened his grip in the 1920s. Some have turned instead to China. Many opponents of Mr Putin and his war see a Ukrainian victory as the best hope for Russia. Mr Sverdlin, who ran the homeless charity in St Petersburg, is now trying to resist Mr Putin from outside the country. His new volunteer group helps Russian soldiers desert and escape, often crossing Russia\u2019s borders illegally. Since the autumn, his organisation has helped 4,000 soldiers flee. \u201cFor me, and for many volunteers, it is not charity, it is our way of striking back.\u201d Few people have as much interest in a Ukrainian victory as Russians who want their country to be peaceful, independent and prosperous. But for Ukraine to feel secure, Russia would need to change radically. Just as the war started in Russia, it can only end there, too. \u25a0\nPhoto: \u00a9Nanna Heitmann/Magnum\nRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.", "about": {"public": null,

See the rest of our coverage\nTANKS DID put a stop to Grigory Sverdlin\u2019s career in the end\u2014but not in the way he expected. In 2017 Mr Sverdlin, who until recently ran one of Russia\u2019s largest and oldest charities, the Shelter, was talking to a local official in St Petersburg about homelessness in the city. It was clear that the activism of groups like his, and civil society more generally, alarmed the authorities. \u201cIf you don\u2019t keep quiet, we will run you over with a tank,\u201d the bureaucrat warned him. \nYet Mr Sverdlin was allowed to continue his work as long as he was not too vocal about the failings of Vladimir Putin\u2019s government. \u201cWe tried to warm the cold air outside our comfortable flats. We tried to create a country where people are independent of the state.\u201d He felt his efforts were working: \u201cRussian [civil] society was growing fast. People started to think not just about themselves, but about their neighbours and what is going on in their streets.\u201d Donations to charities were rising fast (see chart 1).\n\u201cThen this bastard started this war and the temperature dropped 300 degrees and maybe lower than ever\u2014at least in the last 70 years.\u201d After several days of protesting on Nevsky Prospekt, St Petersburg\u2019s grandest boulevard, Mr Sverdlin was warned that he was about to be arrested and so fled the country. \u201cFor years I have been talking about what it is like to be homeless, and suddenly, overnight, I lost my home,\u201d he says.\nMr Sverdlin is one of the hundreds of thousands of Russians who have fled since the war began. Their exodus, and the ruinous effect it is likely to have on Russia\u2019s future, is the subject of a new Economist podcast, \u201cNext Year in Moscow\u201d.  We spoke to dozens of exiles in Britain, Georgia, Turkey and elsewhere\u2014and many people who stayed in Russia. Their stories help explain why Mr Putin started this devastating war and how it will change their country.\n\nExiles like Mr Sverdlin are not the only Russians to have lost their place in society. Some 20,000 have been arrested since the start of the war for protesting against it. The police have even detained people laying flowers by statues of historic figures of Ukrainian origin, since they see the gesture (rightly) as an implicit rebuke. Alexei Navalny, a jailed opposition leader, has been moved to solitary confinement. Prosecutors are preparing a new political show trial for him. \n\nWhat is more, the few remaining institutions that criticise the government or advocate a more liberal society have disappeared. The legal restrictions Mr Putin\u2019s regime has imposed on discussing the war\u2014or even calling it that\u2014have forced the closure of all independent media outlets, including Echo of Moscow, a radio station, and TV Rain, a television channel (both now broadcast from outside Russia). The Moscow Helsinki Group, which campaigns for human rights, has been shut down. Another such outfit, the Andrei Sakharov Centre, is being evicted from its premises. \nDaniel Treisman of the University of California argues that these people and institutions are not accidental victims of the war, but one of its main targets. Ukraine, after all, posed no military threat to Russia. And a vast and sparsely populated country, spanning 11 time zones, could scarcely be said to need more territory.  Rather, it was the gradual emergence in Ukraine of a vigorous civil society that successfully demanded reform of the state, and the inklings of a similar process in Russia, that Mr Putin found threatening.  \nBefore the tanks rolled into Ukraine, Mr Treisman notes, liberal values were spreading fast in Russia. The share of people who told pollsters that freedom of speech was important to them rose from 34% in 2017 to 61% in 2021. Use of the internet was rising rapidly (see chart 2); record numbers were watching Mr Navalny\u2019s YouTube channel. Meanwhile, television viewing, the government\u2019s main tool for shaping Russians\u2019 outlook, was in sharp decline. \nThe shift is largely generational. People born during Russia\u2019s liberalisation in the 1990s tend to be more enterprising than their elders, less prone to rely on the state and more liberal on matters such as gay rights. In 2017 some 70% of older Russians told the Levada Centre, a polling group, that they could not survive without the government\u2019s help, whereas only 27% of people under 35 felt the same. And in 2020, despite the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda, some 60% of young Russians told Levada that they had a positive view of America.  \n\u201cPutin and his crew understood that time was working against them, because the young generation is not interested in their tv propaganda and does not believe that Russia is a besieged fortress encircled by enemies, or that the United States wants to conquer us,\u201d says Mr Sverdlin. This week Mr Navalny echoed that sentiment in a statement conveyed from his prison cell by his lawyers. Alexander Gabuev, who worked for a think-tank in Moscow forced to close last year, laments, \u201cThis is a war against Russia\u2019s future\u2026And Russia\u2019s future will now be very different, regardless of the outcome of the war, from the one it might have been had February 24th not happened.\u201d \nFor one thing, the 500,000 people who have fled are among Russia\u2019s best educated and most dynamic. They may not have had any say in politics even before the war, but their voices were nonetheless audible. No longer. Political debate, to the extent there is any in Russia now, occurs not between those who oppose the war and those who support it, but between \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cturbo-patriots\u201d, who criticise Russian commanders for not being brutal and aggressive enough.  \nBy amplifying pro-war voices and silencing common sense, Mr Putin has achieved an illusion of total support for the war. People are wary of expressing criticism of it in any form but, even so, some 20% of Russians tell pollsters they are against it. It is safe to assume that disquiet is far more widespread than that. \u201cPutin has managed to persuade the minority that it represents a majority, and the majority that it is a minority,\u201d  says Leonid Volkov, Mr Navalny\u2019s chief of staff.\nPolling conducted by Mr Navalny\u2019s team, which operates from outside Russia, suggests that even among supporters of the war confidence in Mr Putin\u2019s wisdom is fast evaporating. Since the summer, the share of people who think that the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d is going as planned has declined from 40% to about 15%. This is hardly surprising, given the rising death toll. In October 6% of Russians said they knew someone who had been killed in the war; by January that figure had doubled. Two-thirds of Russians know someone who has been mobilised or is fighting in the war. \nIn a recent interview Oscar Kuchera, an actor and television host, neatly captured the inchoate views about Ukraine that are typical of many Russians. He simultaneously displayed confusion about the purpose of the war, misgivings about its progress, and ardent support for Mr Putin and \u201cour boys\u201d on the front line. The idea of annexing Ukrainian territory is especially puzzling to him: \u201cDon\u2019t we have enough problems of our own without having to feed someone else?\u201d he asked. But he insisted that Mr Putin must have good reasons for his land grab, even if a simple man like himself could not fully understand them. \nPocketbook patriots\nThe idea that things are under control is bolstered by the stability of the economy. On the surface, Moscow looks much as it did before the war. Some popular Western brands\u2014McDonald\u2019s, IKEA\u2014have disappeared and some martial symbols have materialised. The economy contracted by a little over 2% last year, with the harm inflicted by sanctions largely offset by the benefit of massive export earnings thanks to high prices for oil and gas (see chart 4). Those were equivalent to about $230bn (10% of GDP), according to Re: Russia, a research network, almost compensating for the $275bn of capital that fled the country. The bonanza has allowed the government to boost its spending by a quarter, injecting an extra 5.5trn roubles ($74bn) into the economy. That will only reinforce the state\u2019s growing hold over the economy (see chart 3).\nMonthly output in some import-dependent and consumer-facing industries, such as cars and pharmaceuticals, was 50% lower by the end of 2022 than at the beginning. But arms manufacturing, naturally, has boomed. Tatarstan has seen a joint venture to make Ford cars shut down, but expects a factory to make military drones in collaboration with Iran to open soon.\n\nA lower oil price and sharply reduced sales of gas are likely to lead to a budget crunch this year. In the long run, the exodus of skilled workers will harm the economy. Since the start of the war Russia is estimated to have lost at least 100,000 it specialists. But the bureaucracy has done a good job of adapting to the new circumstances, blunting the immediate impact of the brain-drain and sanctions.  \u201cThey see this as a quest,\u201d says Mikhail Komin, a political scientist who had surveyed middle-level technocrats.  \u201cThey feel as much in demand as the military themselves\u201d. \nIn fact, the war has raised the status of technocrats, and of the army and security services even more so. The government wants to expand the army from its current 1m soldiers to 1.5m. That is 4% of the male, working-age population, a higher share than in any other country bar North Korea. A third of the national budget goes to men in uniform. Spending on the armed forces this year has been revised up by 40% compared with pre-war plans. Spending on domestic security\u2014the machinery of repression\u2014is up by over 50% (see chart 5). Meanwhile, spending on health care has fallen by 9%. To further exalt men in uniform, the government plans to reserve seats in the Duma, Russia\u2019s docile parliament, for \u201cmilitary patriots\u201d.  \nCulture and education have also been \u201cmobilised\u201d. Actors and artists who have decried the war have been expelled from state-funded theatres. The latest victim is Liya Akhedzhakova, a famous actress who has been pushed out of the Sovremennik Theatre after 45 years. Zelfira Tregulova, the director of the Tretyakov Gallery, which houses the country\u2019s biggest collection of Russian art, was dismissed for deviating from the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cspiritual and moral values\u201d.  Her replacement is the daughter of a senior officer in the security services.\nIn short, even though the material impact of the war is scant in much of Russia, the conflict is inescapable. \u201cPutin\u2019s purpose in this war is to  achieve a radical break from the West and thus maintain control over Russian society by moving it into a state of permanent struggle and mobilisation,\u201d says Kirill Rogov, the founder of Re: Russia. Any lack of progress on the battlefield is likely to be compensated for by ever-growing repression and purges, particularly as success becomes more elusive and casualties mount. \nRussians who used to look to Europe for modernisation have been cut off from it, rather as when Stalin tightened his grip in the 1920s. Some have turned instead to China. Many opponents of Mr Putin and his war see a Ukrainian victory as the best hope for Russia. Mr Sverdlin, who ran the homeless charity in St Petersburg, is now trying to resist Mr Putin from outside the country. His new volunteer group helps Russian soldiers desert and escape, often crossing Russia\u2019s borders illegally. Since the autumn, his organisation has helped 4,000 soldiers flee. \u201cFor me, and for many volunteers, it is not charity, it is our way of striking back.\u201d Few people have as much interest in a Ukrainian victory as Russians who want their country to be peaceful, independent and prosperous. But for Ukraine to feel secure, Russia would need to change radically. Just as the war started in Russia, it can only end there, too. \u25a0\nPhoto: \u00a9Nanna Heitmann/Magnum\nRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis.", "description": "Russian society is
