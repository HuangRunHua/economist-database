"https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/06/01/lula-cosies-up-to-nicolas-maduro-venezuelas-autocrat", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "In 2005 Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was then just two years into his first term as Brazil\u2019s president, declared that Venezuela had \u201can excess of democracy\u201d. In fact even then democracy was under threat. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela\u2019s left-wing populist president, had recently introduced a law that restricted what could be broadcast about state officials on radio and TV. In 2007 he called for a constitutional referendum that sought to expand his own powers while abolishing term limits. Nearly two decades later, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s unpopular successor, has taken advantage of his mentor\u2019s anti-democratic policies and is ruling as a dictator. During his decade in power the economy has collapsed by 75%. Some 7m people, or a quarter of the population, have emigrated. Despite this, Lula\u2019s views appear to remain stubbornly the same. \nOn May 29th Lula, who won the presidential election last year for a third term, received Mr Maduro in Bras\u00edlia, the capital. It was the first time Mr Maduro had visited Brazil since 2015. His visit was part of a regional summit of South American leaders. After a series of hugs and backslaps, Lula described his guest, who in 2020 had a $15m bounty placed upon him by the United States government for \u201cnarco-terrorism\u201d, as the victim of \u201ca constructed narrative of authoritarianism\u201d. He declared it \u201cabsurd\u201d to label Mr Maduro an illegitimate leader given that he was \u201celected by the people\u201d; a sophistic argument which sidesteps the context of the rigged election in 2018, which 60 governments globally declared to be fraudulent.\nMr Maduro\u2019s regime also faces grave human-rights allegations, including torture. Under Donald Trump, American sanctions were placed on the country and its oil industry. But this did not deter Lula in his fulsome praise. \u201cOur opponents\u201d, he declared, \u201cwill have to apologise for the damage they did in Venezuela.\u201d\nWhy is Lula cosying up to his unsavoury neighbour? The simplest explanation is that the president is an old-school left-winger, and the instinct of the founder of Brazil\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party will always be to see Mr Maduro\u2019s regime not as a corrupt cabal but as a victim of the machinations of \u201cimperialist\u201d outsiders, such as the United States. Indeed, in some ways it seems as if Lula has not updated his arguments for nearly 20 years. On May 30th he cited the penchant of Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013, for referendums as examples of how democratic the country is today. Mr Maduro has blocked referendums by the opposition. \nHowever, Lula\u2019s effusive support for Mr Maduro may also have a more practical purpose. The two countries share a 2,200km (1,400-mile) border, most of it in the Amazonian region. This area is a key focus of Lula\u2019s attention as he has promised to curb deforestation, which rose sharply under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist. One driver of tree-felling is illegal gold-mining. Tackling that, an enormously complex task, requires co-operation with Mr Maduro. Similarly, reducing migration from Venezuela is another challenge, as it is pushing up unemployment in northern Brazil.\nBut the primary reason appears to be that Lula, now 77 years old, is keen to become a global peacemaker. Guilherme Casar\u00f5es at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation, a university, believes that the president has decided to take charge of foreign-policy decisions himself, rather than listen to his advisers. Since Lula\u2019s inauguration in January, when he declared that \u201cBrazil is back\u201d, the president has taken about one official international trip a month, which has led allies to grumble privately that he is neglecting domestic issues. He wants to create a \u201cpeace club\u201d to deal with the war in Ukraine. But his attempts at diplomacy have floundered, not least as he accused Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, of being \u201cas responsible as [Vladimir] Putin for the war\u201d. Lula may be motivated by an ambition \u201cto negotiate a democratic transition in Venezuela\u201d, says Rubens Barbosa, a former ambassador for Brazil.\nWhatever the reasons for Lula\u2019s staunch defence of Mr Maduro, it appears to have backfired. Sergio Moro, a judge who in 2017 sentenced Lula to prison on charges of corruption (the convictions of which were later annulled), tweeted that \u201cBrazil is back to welcoming South American dictators with state honours\u201d. Mr Moro, who was elected as a senator last year, has requested that Brazil\u2019s Senate hold a hearing on human-rights abuses in Venezuela and that Maria Corina Machado, a prominent Venezuelan opposition leader, be invited. She could not attend in person, as she is banned from travelling by Mr Maduro\u2019s regime.\nMaduro\u2019s new mates\nSimilarly, on May 30th many of Lula\u2019s presidential guests took him to task for glossing over Mr Maduro\u2019s record on human rights. Luis Lacalle Pou, Uruguay\u2019s conservative president, warned of the risks of ignoring reality. Chile\u2019s left-wing leader, Gabriel Boric, said that he disagreed with Lula that human-rights violations are a \u201cnarrative construction\u201d, adding that: \u201cIt is a reality, it is serious.\u201d However, he agreed that sanctions on Venezuela should be lifted. \nLula and Mr Boric are not alone in wanting to lessen Mr Maduro\u2019s isolation. Even the United States government has begun to reduce some of its sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.
