It is a brick from the 16th-century Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, in north India. \u201cI got it on December 6th 1992,\u201d says Sohan Lal Arya, referring to the day the mosque was torn down by a Hindu nationalist mob. Mr Arya and other of its members, including leaders of the now-ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), claimed the mosque had been built on the birthplace of Ram, a Hindu god.\nThe destruction of Babri Masjid, which sparked riots in which some 2,000 people died, was the culmination of a years-long campaign by bjp leaders to replace the mosque with a Ram temple. It galvanised the Hindu-nationalist movement, radicalising and recruiting millions of Hindu activists, and helped propel the BJP from the outer margins of Indian politics to become, by 1996, the biggest party in the Lok Sabha, India\u2019s lower house. When Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, inaugurates the long-promised Ram temple in Ayodhya next month, it will complete a staggeringly effective political campaign\u2014from which the bjp leader will aim to wring yet more advantage. The ceremony will be the unofficial launch of his campaign for an election expected in April, at which the bjp could become the first party since 1971 to win a third consecutive majority.\nThe new Ram temple was made possible by India\u2019s Supreme Court, which in 2019 rewarded the destroyers of the mosque by ruling that the site should be handed to a Hindu trust. Emboldened by this, Hindu activists such as Mr Arya are now targeting thousands of other mosques across India, including one in Varanasi, 200km (125 miles) south of Ayodhya. Built in 1669 by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, the city\u2019s Gyanvapi mosque sits on land formerly occupied by a Hindu temple. A long-standing local Hindu grievance, this has recently been raised by bjp activists to a matter of national importance. Some, including Mr Arya\u2019s wife, claim to have found extant temple remains at the site.\nThe mosque is now surrounded by high metal fencing and guarded by armed police. As a possible augury of its fate, a neighbouring Hindu temple complex has been massively expanded; it now looms over the disputed mosque. The temple expansion is thanks to the local Lok Sabha member, Mr Modi. The prime minister has vowed to restore the area to its \u201clost glory\u201d.\nUntangling competing claims about events that occurred centuries ago is impossible. Some historians believe that, even before the Gyanvapi mosque site housed a temple, it housed an earlier mosque, and an even older temple before that. A law passed in 1991 sought to allay such disputes by mandating that places of worship should retain the status that they had at independence in 1947. Despite this, a court in Varanasi controversially ruled in the Hindu activists\u2019 favour. Researchers from the Archaeological Survey of India, which looks after national monuments, have therefore been inspecting the mosque site for traces of Hindu worship. It is due to present a report to the Allahabad High Court later this month. \nAgitating to replace mosques with temples illustrates Hindu nationalism\u2019s strange mix of triumphalism and insecurity. It feeds a narrative that Hindus (who are 80% of India\u2019s population) are victims, with grievances both old (such as oppression by Muslim emperors five centuries ago) and new (such as \u201clove jihad\u201d, a conspiracy theory that Muslim men are plotting to seduce and convert Hindu women). Such scare tactics help distract from the bjp government\u2019s failures in other areas, including high unemployment and the filthy state of the Ganges river at Varanasi, though it is also sacred to Hindus and cleaning it up is another pet project of Mr Modi\u2019s. Nonetheless, he is \u201cthe best prime minister ever; he\u2019s like a saint,\u201d says Shravan Kumar Mishra, a bead wholesaler in Varanasi. Thanks to Mr Modi, he says, \u201cHindus walk with their heads held high, and Muslims keep their heads down.\u201d\nNot far from the Gyanvapi mosque, when The Economist visited, was a poster of Mr Modi emblazoned with the slogan: \u201c1.4 billion people. 1 dream\u201d. In smaller letters, it clarified that this referred to the laudable goal of generating lots of electricity, on which the Modi government has made good progress. Yet the poster also depicted the steps outside that rapidly expanding Hindu temple in Varanasi. No wonder India\u2019s 200m Muslims fear for their place in the increasingly Hindu-dominated country of which Mr Modi and his party dream.
