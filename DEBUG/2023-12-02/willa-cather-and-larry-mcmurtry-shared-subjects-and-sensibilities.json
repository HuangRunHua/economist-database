By Benjamin Taylor. Viking; 192 pages; $29\nLarry McMurtry: A Life. By Tracy Daugherty. St Martin\u2019s Press; 560 pages; $35 and \u00a330\nThe American West is a great setting for a story but a hard place to live. That is the theme of new biographies of Willa Cather and Larry McMurtry, 20th-century novelists who abandoned a life among cattle and dust for the comforts of the city. Yet the writers also shared an inability to escape their roots and returned\u2014in fiction, at least\u2014to the places they had left. McMurtry wrote elegiac (and occasionally bitter) stories about Texas cowboys. Cather sketched the plains of Nebraska. \nTracy Daugherty, who has written biographies of Joan Didion and Joseph Heller, has now completed a comprehensive and nuanced account of McMurtry\u2014the first since his death in 2021. McMurtry produced memorable books including \u201cThe Last Picture Show\u201d (1966), a send-up of his northern Texas hometown, and \u201cLonesome Dove\u201d (1985), about a cattle drive, which won a Pulitzer prize. \nMcMurtry\u2019s family owned a ranch, but he was no cowboy: he preferred to spend his time with a book rather than in the saddle. He devoured children\u2019s books before turning to masterworks such as \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and \u201cMadame Bovary\u201d. His passion for literature continued into adulthood: as well as writing books, he collected and sold them. A happy afternoon would find him browsing shelves or selling first editions in one of his shops. \nWriting was a chore by comparison. \u201cUnfortunately good writers are made in empty rooms with typewriters in them,\u201d he lamented. With a certain resignation, he made a habit of finishing ten pages a day. He set out to puncture the legend of the American West in his tales, but often only added to frontier mythology. Readers did not seem to mind much.\nMovie producers also loved his stories. Novels including \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d (1975), a family drama, were adapted into acclaimed films; some of the happiest years of his life were spent in Hollywood. But, during a long decline beset by illness and melancholy, he churned out middling books that diminished his reputation. \nBy contrast, Willa Cather left behind a coherent body of work after her death in 1947. \u201cChasing Bright Medusas\u201d offers an excellent companion to Cather\u2019s writing. Born in Virginia and brought up in Red Cloud, Nebraska, Cather excelled at short novels of the Great Plains, and later, the south-west. In elegant but unadorned prose Cather captured the simple beauty of the countryside and its people. \u201cDeath Comes for the Archbishop\u201d (1927), set in New Mexico, was her \u201cmasterpiece among masterpieces\u201d, Benjamin Taylor writes.\nShe had her first taste of cosmopolitan life on the frontier. As Mr Taylor explains, Cather encountered bohemians and Scandinavians in small Nebraska towns, and populated her novels with similar characters speaking in foreign tongues. She imagined their struggles: her books probed difficult subjects including suicide and loveless marriages. Cather eventually left for New York and, like other Manhattanites, enjoyed the open spaces of Central Park. \nMr Taylor approaches Cather\u2019s work in a spirit of appreciation. A shelf of studies of the author already exists, he says, so instead he aims for a personal response to her work. That means his view is unabashedly partisan. At one point Mr Taylor defends Cather against criticism from Ernest Hemingway, who had privately mocked her for writing about war without ever having seen a battle. \u201cWith all due respect to Hemingway,\u201d Mr Taylor writes, her interest was in the nature of grief, not munitions.\nYou might assume that Cather\u2019s and McMurtry\u2019s work would be steeped in conservatism, religion and practical values. Yet McMurtry was immersed in the counterculture, studying literature alongside Ken Kesey and other psychedelic-drug-dabbling hippies. Cather was a lesbian who enjoyed a lifelong partnership with a woman and created androgynous characters. Perhaps they found the American West too stifling a place to call home, even as they immortalised it in print. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up
