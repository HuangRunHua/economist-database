Mr Munger was Warren Buffett\u2019s long-standing partner at Berkshire Hathaway. Their friendship stretched back to Mr Buffett\u2019s first investments in the 1950s. Mr Munger joined the holding company\u2019s board in 1978. Mr Buffett credited Mr Munger with breaking \u201cmy cigar-butt habits\u201d and driving company strategy, once telling shareholders that he was merely the contractor while Mr Munger was the architect of the business\u2019s growth. \nThe sun shines for Shein\nShein, a fast-fashion retailer, has filed for an initial public offering in America, according to reports. Shein\u2019s cheap clothing range is hugely popular; its sales are comparable to those of H&M and Zara. America is its biggest market and Shein\u2019s website is almost as in demand as Amazon\u2019s among teenagers. The company was founded in China but now has its headquarters in Singapore. That might smooth the process for what could be the biggest stockmarket flotation of a Chinese-origin firm since Didi Global\u2019s ill-fated IPO in 2021. \nByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, is reportedly pulling out of the mobile-gaming business. Its Nuverse division accounts for only a fraction of its revenues and is being wound down. \nHong Kong\u2019s exports grew in October by 1.4%, year on year, the first increase since April 2022. Shipments to mainland China were up by 5.6%, which was taken as an optimistic sign that regional trade is on the road to recovery. \nThe euro zone\u2019s annual inflation rate dropped to 2.4% in November from 2.9% in November. That puts more pressure on the European Central Bank to hold interest rates steady, if not cut them. Before November\u2019s figure was released Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, said that \u201cThis is not the time to start declaring victory\u201d against inflation, as there was considerable uncertainty about future movements in prices. \nTesla prepared the first deliveries of its long-delayed Cybertruck. Initial orders for the vehicle were placed before the start of the pandemic but production has been plagued with problems. Elon Musk has described the SUV as a \u201cbadass, futuristic armoured personnel carrier\u201d and \u201cintentionally an insane technology bandwagon\u201d. Tesla doesn\u2019t expect to make a profit from it for at least 18 months. \nNissan and AESC, its battery-making partner, are investing another \u00a32bn ($2.5bn) making electric cars and batteries in Sunderland, a deprived city in England\u2019s north-east. The investment includes a new gigafactory. The news was welcomed by the British government, which has made more money available to support battery manufacturing. The factories will add 20 gigawatt hours of battery capacity annually by 2030. \nBoots, Britain\u2019s biggest chain of chemists, sold its \u00a34.8bn ($6.1bn) pension scheme to Legal & General, a financial-services firm. The deal opens the way for a potential sale of Boots by its owner, Walgreens Boots Alliance. The American company tried, and failed, to sell the business last year. \nThe European Union\u2019s antitrust commissioner lodged a formal objection against Amazon\u2019s proposed acquisition of iRobot, claiming the deal \u201cmay restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners\u201d. Amazon announced the takeover in August 2022. America\u2019s Federal Trade Commission, which launched a wide-ranging antitrust lawsuit against Amazon in September, is also investigating the proposal. \nAnother potential tech takeover also received a setback when Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority decided that Adobe\u2019s offer to buy Figma, an online service used by designers to develop apps and websites, could harm the digital-design industry. Adobe has offered $20bn for Figma. Critics of the deal claim the software giant is trying to squash a potential rival. \nPet project\n\nAmerica\u2019s Food and Drug Administration accepted a \u201creasonable expectation of effectiveness\u201d application from Loyal, a firm in San Francisco, for its candidate life-extending drug for large dogs. This is the first time the administration has officially recognised the possibility that a drug intended for any species might have general lifespan-extending properties.\nA record summer helped propel easyJet to its first annual pre-tax profit since the start of the pandemic. It has reinstated its shareholder dividend, making it one of the first big European airlines to do so.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund is buying a 10% stake in Heathrow. Ferrovial, an infrastructure company, is selling its 25% holding in the airport. Ardian, a French private-equity firm, is buying the other 15%. \nA Virgin Atlantic 787 made the world\u2019s first commercial flight powered completely by sustainable aviation fuel. The plane burned a fuel blend that was 88% waste fat (from cooking oils and food scraps) and 12% synthetic kerosene made from plant sugars. The aircraft flew from London to New York. It did emit carbon, though the emissions over the fuel\u2019s life cycle were 70% lower than those that power a regular flight.
