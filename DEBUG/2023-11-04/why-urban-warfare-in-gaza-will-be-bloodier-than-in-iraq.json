The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 8,000 people have died. The number of children among them, more than 3,000, exceeds the annual death toll for children in all wars in each of the preceding three years. The Economist estimates, from satellite imagery, that over a tenth of Gaza\u2019s housing stock has been destroyed, leaving more than 280,000 people without homes to which they can return. In many ways that fits with the norm of urban warfare, which is unusually destructive. But Israel\u2019s war in Gaza is also distinctive.\nRead all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas\n\nWar in built-up areas is always bloody. America\u2019s first assault on Fallujah in 2004 killed as many as 600 civilians, or 0.2% of the population, compared with 0.3% in today\u2019s war in Gaza. A second assault later in the year killed around 800 more and left the majority of the city\u2019s buildings damaged. A battle for Sadr City, a suburb of Baghdad, is thought to have killed nearly 1,000 people in March and April 2008, out of a population of around 2m, not dissimilar to that of Gaza.\nThe largest urban battle in recent years was the assault on the city of Mosul, which had been seized by the Islamic State (IS) group, by an American-led coalition including Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces. At least 9,000 civilians were killed in Mosul during 2016-17, according to Airwars, a non-profit organisation that tracks civilian harm. That amounts to 0.6% of the population at the time. Of the buildings that were damaged, more than 80% were residential. \nThese cases might suggest that the war in Gaza, though destructive, is not unusually so by historical standards\u2014at least not yet. Yet there are also key differences. The first and biggest is the status of civilians. In Mosul, IS attempted to prevent civilians from fleeing, firing at them and mining corridors out of the city. Many left nonetheless. Between October 2016 and June 2017 nearly 900,000 departed\u2014almost half of the pre-war population. Even Russia, during its siege of Mariupol in Ukraine between February and May 2022, negotiated humanitarian pauses in which some civilians were permitted to leave. Israel has thus far rejected calls, by the European Union and others, for such pauses.\nGaza\u2019s geography is less permissive than any of these cases. Israel has told around 1.1m civilians to evacuate from the north of Gaza, but around a third of those have remained in place. Many residents are already refugees from other places and fear that if they leave they might never be allowed to return to their homes. Those who do want to escape cannot go south to Egypt, which does not want to take responsibility for refugees and has so far refused to open its border.\nIsrael is still striking parts of southern Gaza, albeit in more limited fashion than the north. \u201cLocals can\u2019t really get away, nor can fighting really occur in open areas away from urban centres,\u201d says Amos Fox, an expert on urban warfare who has written extensively about Mosul. \u201cThe urban fight [in Gaza] is self-contained and likely far more costly than anything we\u2019ve seen in the past few years.\u201d Even those civilians who have moved south face a growing humanitarian crisis. Gaza\u2019s health-care system has capacity for only 3,500 beds, according to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, a humanitarian group, far short of what is needed.\nIn Mosul, by contrast, the World Health Organisation was able to establish trauma stabilisation points to provide urgent medical attention within 10-15 minutes of the front line, with larger field hospitals another hour away. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have a small number of \u201chumanitarian affairs officers\u201d embedded in its fighting units whose role it is to try and address the needs of the local population, but these are far from sufficient for dealing with the needs and scale of misery resulting from a ground offensive. Israeli politicians have said they will not send aid for civilians until all hostages are released, though officials acknowledge that may change as the offensive develops.\nA second difference is the degree to which civilian and military infrastructure is intermingled in Gaza. In Iraq, IS had held Mosul for little over two years when the battle to remove them began. Even in that short period, the group had established impressive multi-layered defences, drawing on Western military doctrine, says Rupert Jones, a retired British major-general who was deputy commander of the anti-IS coalition.\nHamas, in contrast, was founded in Gaza in 1987 and has much earlier roots there, dating back to the foundation of the welfare organisation Mujama al-Islamiya (\u2018Islamic Centre\u201d) by Ahmed Yassin in 1973. For half a century it has been fully integrated into Gaza\u2019s social fabric and has run the strip for 16 years. Its defences have been built around\u2014and under\u2014the territory\u2019s civilian infrastructure. Part of the ease with which Hamas seized Gaza from Palestinian rivals in 2007 was down to the fact that its fighters were recruited from the streets. \nA third difference is tactics. Israel\u2019s armed forces say that they place considerable emphasis on civilian protection. Nonetheless, Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza has been intense by historical standards. It dropped 6,000 bombs on the territory in the first six days of the war, a rate of ordnance far exceeding American and Western counter-terrorism campaigns. In Mosul, for instance, the American-led coalition dropped 7,000 over two months in the most intense period of bombing. On October 30th a former deputy commander of the IDF\u2019s Gaza Division told the Financial Times: \u201cWhen our soldiers are manoeuvring we are doing this with massive artillery, with 50 aeroplanes overhead destroying anything that moves.\u201d\nTactics are shaped by how an army views the stakes of a war, the nature of the enemy and that of the surrounding civilians. For Israel, the war in Gaza is \u201cexistential in a way that even Mosul or Marawi weren\u2019t\u201d, says Anthony King of Exeter University, referring to a battle between the Philippines army and IS in 2017. Israeli officials increasingly describe Hamas as akin to IS\u2014an enemy with which compromise is no longer possible. Nor does the IDF have the same affinity with Palestinian civilians that Iraqi forces did with the compatriots they were liberating from IS rule. \nIn Mosul, Iraq\u2019s political leadership, from the prime minister down, insisted that great emphasis be placed on civilian protection. Lieutenant General Basim al-Tai, a senior Iraqi officer, was in charge of the humanitarian operation. \u201cHe was carrying the weight of the Mosul population on his shoulders,\u201d says General Jones. \u201cHe cared deeply about the civilians.\u201d Caroline Baudot, an adviser in the civilian-protection unit in the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, agrees: \u201cThe commander\u2019s intent in Mosul was extremely clear.\u201d \nEven then, the experience of different parts of Mosul is instructive. The east of the city, viewed as the more intellectual and urbane part, suffered less damage. The old city in the west, where IS made its last stand, was viewed by Iraqi forces as more conservative and IS-friendly and emerged far worse. \u201cThe mindset in which you fight affects your planning, your conduct, and even the reconstruction,\u201d says Ms Baudot. \u201cIf you operate on your own territory [as opposed to] in another territory you might not have the same care for civilians.\u201d \nThe role of medical facilities is especially contentious. In the previous rounds of warfare, Palestinian hospitals and other civilian relief centres were marked on Israeli military maps as non-strike areas. Some were hit in past wars, but none intentionally, claims Israel. In this war, Israel has ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza, including hospitals\u2014which it says are used as Hamas command posts. Under the laws of war, hospitals lose their special protection if they are used for military purposes. But, even then, armies can only attack them \u201cafter due warning\u201d and \u201ca reasonable time limit\u201d. \nMosul, again, provides a point of comparison. IS used the city\u2019s hospital as a stronghold. Commanders spent weeks deliberating whether it could be attacked, says General Jones, considering other options such as the use of snipers. \u201cSlowly, over time, it became clear it was no longer a functional hospital.\u201d Ultimately it was struck only with the approval of Iraq\u2019s then prime minister. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of any case where you have a few days to evacuate and dismantle an entire hospital,\u201d says one veteran expert on wartime civilian harm, reflecting on the Gaza case. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible.\u201d \nA fourth and final difference is the nature of battlefield intelligence. At the outset of this war the IDF would have had considerable intelligence on Hamas\u2019s infrastructure in Gaza, collected over years. But many of those targets would have been struck in the first week of the campaign. Air forces must then move to \u201cdynamic\u201d targeting\u2014finding and striking targets that were not known at the start of the war and have to be developed in relatively short order.  This is where most cases of civilian harm occur, says the expert. \nIn Mosul, local civilians, many of whom hated IS, provided a wealth of human intelligence, or HUMINT\u2014information passed on by sources on the ground\u2014to Iraqi forces, helping them to target IS fighters. In contrast, during the battle for Raqqa, a Syrian city held by IS, in 2017, commanders, with fewer infantry forces on the ground, were \u201cstarved of local information\u201d and found themselves reliant on aerial surveillance, incapable of seeing inside buildings, according to a report by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank. \nIsraeli intelligence has already suffered one serious intelligence failure in Gaza, having missed sufficient signs of Hamas\u2019s preparations for the attack of October 7th. It will have good electronic intelligence on the strip, aided by the phalanx of American aircraft patrolling in the eastern Mediterranean. But Hamas is likely to have the intelligence advantage on the ground, argues Mr Fox, with locals offering a steady flow of HUMINT to the group as the IDF advances. \u201cThis flips the HUMINT situation that we saw in Mosul on its head,\u201d he says. \u201cThe IDF will have to methodically fight through better planned and prepared defences\u2026than they otherwise would.\u201d The result will be more civilians killed. The last three weeks have been hard on civilians in Gaza. The coming weeks could be even harder. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Bloodier than in Iraq", "section": {"url": {"canonical":

civilians. The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 8,000 people have died. The number of children among them, more than 3,000, exceeds the annual death toll for children in all wars in each of the preceding three years. The Economist estimates, from satellite imagery, that over a tenth of Gaza\u2019s housing stock has been destroyed, leaving more than 280,000 people without homes to which they can return. In many ways that fits with the norm of urban warfare, which is unusually destructive. But Israel\u2019s war in Gaza is also distinctive.\nRead all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas\n\nWar in built-up areas is always bloody. America\u2019s first assault on Fallujah in 2004 killed as many as 600 civilians, or 0.2% of the population, compared with 0.3% in today\u2019s war in Gaza. A second assault later in the year killed around 800 more and left the majority of the city\u2019s buildings damaged. A battle for Sadr City, a suburb of Baghdad, is thought to have killed nearly 1,000 people in March and April 2008, out of a population of around 2m, not dissimilar to that of Gaza.\nThe largest urban battle in recent years was the assault on the city of Mosul, which had been seized by the Islamic State (IS) group, by an American-led coalition including Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces. At least 9,000 civilians were killed in Mosul during 2016-17, according to Airwars, a non-profit organisation that tracks civilian harm. That amounts to 0.6% of the population at the time. Of the buildings that were damaged, more than 80% were residential. \nThese cases might suggest that the war in Gaza, though destructive, is not unusually so by historical standards\u2014at least not yet. Yet there are also key differences. The first and biggest is the status of civilians. In Mosul, IS attempted to prevent civilians from fleeing, firing at them and mining corridors out of the city. Many left nonetheless. Between October 2016 and June 2017 nearly 900,000 departed\u2014almost half of the pre-war population. Even Russia, during its siege of Mariupol in Ukraine between February and May 2022, negotiated humanitarian pauses in which some civilians were permitted to leave. Israel has thus far rejected calls, by the European Union and others, for such pauses.\nGaza\u2019s geography is less permissive than any of these cases. Israel has told around 1.1m civilians to evacuate from the north of Gaza, but around a third of those have remained in place. Many residents are already refugees from other places and fear that if they leave they might never be allowed to return to their homes. Those who do want to escape cannot go south to Egypt, which does not want to take responsibility for refugees and has so far refused to open its border.\nIsrael is still striking parts of southern Gaza, albeit in more limited fashion than the north. \u201cLocals can\u2019t really get away, nor can fighting really occur in open areas away from urban centres,\u201d says Amos Fox, an expert on urban warfare who has written extensively about Mosul. \u201cThe urban fight [in Gaza] is self-contained and likely far more costly than anything we\u2019ve seen in the past few years.\u201d Even those civilians who have moved south face a growing humanitarian crisis. Gaza\u2019s health-care system has capacity for only 3,500 beds, according to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, a humanitarian group, far short of what is needed.\nIn Mosul, by contrast, the World Health Organisation was able to establish trauma stabilisation points to provide urgent medical attention within 10-15 minutes of the front line, with larger field hospitals another hour away. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have a small number of \u201chumanitarian affairs officers\u201d embedded in its fighting units whose role it is to try and address the needs of the local population, but these are far from sufficient for dealing with the needs and scale of misery resulting from a ground offensive. Israeli politicians have said they will not send aid for civilians until all hostages are released, though officials acknowledge that may change as the offensive develops.\nA second difference is the degree to which civilian and military infrastructure is intermingled in Gaza. In Iraq, IS had held Mosul for little over two years when the battle to remove them began. Even in that short period, the group had established impressive multi-layered defences, drawing on Western military doctrine, says Rupert Jones, a retired British major-general who was deputy commander of the anti-IS coalition.\nHamas, in contrast, was founded in Gaza in 1987 and has much earlier roots there, dating back to the foundation of the welfare organisation Mujama al-Islamiya (\u2018Islamic Centre\u201d) by Ahmed Yassin in 1973. For half a century it has been fully integrated into Gaza\u2019s social fabric and has run the strip for 16 years. Its defences have been built around\u2014and under\u2014the territory\u2019s civilian infrastructure. Part of the ease with which Hamas seized Gaza from Palestinian rivals in 2007 was down to the fact that its fighters were recruited from the streets. \nA third difference is tactics. Israel\u2019s armed forces say that they place considerable emphasis on civilian protection. Nonetheless, Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza has been intense by historical standards. It dropped 6,000 bombs on the territory in the first six days of the war, a rate of ordnance far exceeding American and Western counter-terrorism campaigns. In Mosul, for instance, the American-led coalition dropped 7,000 over two months in the most intense period of bombing. On October 30th a former deputy commander of the IDF\u2019s Gaza Division told the Financial Times: \u201cWhen our soldiers are manoeuvring we are doing this with massive artillery, with 50 aeroplanes overhead destroying anything that moves.\u201d\nTactics are shaped by how an army views the stakes of a war, the nature of the enemy and that of the surrounding civilians. For Israel, the war in Gaza is \u201cexistential in a way that even Mosul or Marawi weren\u2019t\u201d, says Anthony King of Exeter University, referring to a battle between the Philippines army and IS in 2017. Israeli officials increasingly describe Hamas as akin to IS\u2014an enemy with which compromise is no longer possible. Nor does the IDF have the same affinity with Palestinian civilians that Iraqi forces did with the compatriots they were liberating from IS rule. \nIn Mosul, Iraq\u2019s political leadership, from the prime minister down, insisted that great emphasis be placed on civilian protection. Lieutenant General Basim al-Tai, a senior Iraqi officer, was in charge of the humanitarian operation. \u201cHe was carrying the weight of the Mosul population on his shoulders,\u201d says General Jones. \u201cHe cared deeply about the civilians.\u201d Caroline Baudot, an adviser in the civilian-protection unit in the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, agrees: \u201cThe commander\u2019s intent in Mosul was extremely clear.\u201d \nEven then, the experience of different parts of Mosul is instructive. The east of the city, viewed as the more intellectual and urbane part, suffered less damage. The old city in the west, where IS made its last stand, was viewed by Iraqi forces as more conservative and IS-friendly and emerged far worse. \u201cThe mindset in which you fight affects your planning, your conduct, and even the reconstruction,\u201d says Ms Baudot. \u201cIf you operate on your own territory [as opposed to] in another territory you might not have the same care for civilians.\u201d \nThe role of medical facilities is especially contentious. In the previous rounds of warfare, Palestinian hospitals and other civilian relief centres were marked on Israeli military maps as non-strike areas. Some were hit in past wars, but none intentionally, claims Israel. In this war, Israel has ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza, including hospitals\u2014which it says are used as Hamas command posts. Under the laws of war, hospitals lose their special protection if they are used for military purposes. But, even then, armies can only attack them \u201cafter due warning\u201d and \u201ca reasonable time limit\u201d. \nMosul, again, provides a point of comparison. IS used the city\u2019s hospital as a stronghold. Commanders spent weeks deliberating whether it could be attacked, says General Jones, considering other options such as the use of snipers. \u201cSlowly, over time, it became clear it was no longer a functional hospital.\u201d Ultimately it was struck only with the approval of Iraq\u2019s then prime minister. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of any case where you have a few days to evacuate and dismantle an entire hospital,\u201d says one veteran expert on wartime civilian harm, reflecting on the Gaza case. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible.\u201d \nA fourth and final difference is the nature of battlefield intelligence. At the outset of this war the IDF would have had considerable intelligence on Hamas\u2019s infrastructure in Gaza, collected over years. But many of those targets would have been struck in the first week of the campaign. Air forces must then move to \u201cdynamic\u201d targeting\u2014finding and striking targets that were not known at the start of the war and have to be developed in relatively short order.  This is where most cases of civilian harm occur, says the expert. \nIn Mosul, local civilians, many of whom hated IS, provided a wealth of human intelligence, or HUMINT\u2014information passed on by sources on the ground\u2014to Iraqi forces, helping them to target IS fighters. In contrast, during the battle for Raqqa, a Syrian city held by IS, in 2017, commanders, with fewer infantry forces on the ground, were \u201cstarved of local information\u201d and found themselves reliant on aerial surveillance, incapable of seeing inside buildings, according to a report by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank. \nIsraeli intelligence has already suffered one serious intelligence failure in Gaza, having missed sufficient signs of Hamas\u2019s preparations for the attack of October 7th. It will have good electronic intelligence on the strip, aided by the phalanx of American aircraft patrolling in the eastern Mediterranean. But Hamas is likely to have the intelligence advantage on the ground, argues Mr Fox, with locals offering a steady flow of HUMINT to the group as the IDF advances. \u201cThis flips the HUMINT situation that we saw in Mosul on its head,\u201d he says. \u201cThe IDF will have to methodically fight through better planned and prepared defences\u2026than they otherwise would.\u201d The result will be more civilians killed. The last three weeks have been hard on civilians in Gaza. The coming weeks could be even harder. \u25a0", "description": "The battle against IS in Mosul offers Israel lessons\u2014and warnings", "ogDescription": "The battle against IS in Mosul offers Israel
