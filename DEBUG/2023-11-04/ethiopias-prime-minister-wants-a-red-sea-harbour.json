just a year after the end of a brutal civil war in Ethiopia that led to the deaths of perhaps 385,000-600,000 people. Now foreign diplomats and analysts fear that in his bid to get a port on the Red Sea, Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, risks sparking another conflict, this time next to one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping routes (see map). \n\nIn a jingoistic documentary aired on state television on October 13th, Abiy argued that landlocked Ethiopia must acquire a port on the Red Sea to break its roughly 120m people out of a \u201cgeographic prison\u201d. Turning to history, he quoted a 19th-century Ethiopian warrior who had proclaimed that the Red Sea was the country\u2019s \u201cnatural boundary\u201d. \nEthiopia, Abiy noted, had indeed been a sea power with a navy and two ports, Massawa and Assab. It lost these along with the rest of its coastline in 1993, when Eritrea seceded to form a new country. Now, Abiy suggested, the moment was nigh to right a historic wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of luxury,\u201d he insisted, \u201cbut an existential one.\u201d  Foreign diplomats say this reflects what Abiy has been declaring in private for months.\nEthiopia\u2019s neighbours are rattled, particularly because Abiy had not raised the issue with them before making his threats. \u201cThe whole country thinks the man is mad,\u201d says an adviser to Somalia\u2019s president. A fight over ports would further destabilise a region already in turmoil. Sudan, Ethiopia\u2019s neighbour to the west, has been plunged into what the UN calls \u201cone of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history\u201d. Fighting between two warlords there has forced almost 7m people from their homes. And Ethiopia itself faces simmering rebellions in Oromia, its largest and most populous region, and Amhara.\nAbiy says that Ethiopia\u2019s demands can be met through peaceful negotiations with its neighbours. Better to discuss the matter now, he argues, than to risk an armed conflict in the future. But Abiy has reportedly said in private that he is ready to use force if talks fail. \u201cIf it is not achieved by other means, war is the way,\u201d says an Ethiopian official. A few days after the broadcast Abiy flexed his muscles with a military parade in the capital, Addis Ababa, in which the army displayed its new weapons including a Russian-made electronic-warfare system. Troop movements have been detected along both sides of Ethiopia\u2019s border with Eritrea in recent weeks. A well-connected source in Addis Ababa says that the armed forces are exercising in preparation for another conflict. On October 22nd the head of the air force warned his troops to ready themselves for war.\nEthiopia\u2019s Red Sea conundrum dates back to at least the start of its bloody border war with Eritrea in 1998. Though a ceasefire was reached in 2000, the two countries remained at loggerheads. Ethiopia could not ship goods through Assab and Massawa. Now 90-95% of its external trade flows through Djibouti, to which it pays some $1.5bn a year in port fees. \nIn 2018, soon after Abiy came to power, he ended the nearly two decades-long stand-off with Eritrea by signing a peace deal with its dictator, Issaias Afwerki. Though the contents of the deal were never made public, it was generally understood that Ethiopia would regain tax-free access to Eritrea\u2019s ports in exchange for returning disputed territories it had occupied since the end of the war. The following year Abiy was awarded the Nobel peace prize.\nBut plans for Ethiopia to use Eritrea\u2019s ports never materialised. Instead, two years later, a power struggle between Abiy and Tigray\u2019s ruling party, the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), sparked civil war. Eritrean troops joined in on Abiy\u2019s side to fight against the TPLF, which Issaias has long hated. \nThe two leaders have fallen out since then, possibly because Ethiopia signed a peace deal with the TPLF in late 2022. Each sees the other as a threat to their influence over the region. \u201cAbiy and Issaias cannot co-exist in this region,\u201d says an Ethiopian opposition leader. \u201cWar is inevitable.\u201d \nIncreased tensions with Eritrea could exacerbate Ethiopia\u2019s existing internal conflicts. Under the peace deal Abiy struck with the TPLF last year, it was supposed to disarm and demobilise its fighters while Eritrea was meant to withdraw its forces from Tigray. But Eritrea remains in control of at least 52 districts of northern Tigray, according to the region\u2019s interim administrators. In recent weeks, Eritrean troops have expanded their presence along the border areas, reports a visiting foreign researcher. Tigrayan forces have handed over most of their heavy weaponry to the Ethiopian army. But they still have some 200,000 men and women under arms. \nAnother party in the multi-sided civil war in Tigray was Ethiopia\u2019s Amhara regional government, which sent its own militias and troops to fight alongside Abiy\u2019s federal forces. These troops were also supposed to have withdrawn from disputed territories inside Tigray that they occupied at the start of the war. But they have yet to do so. Instead, they have turned on Abiy\u2019s government, accusing it of betraying Amhara\u2019s interests. In August they fought federal forces for control of several towns. \nShifting alliances\nWith so much bad blood and so many armed groups jostling for influence within Ethiopia, Abiy\u2019s threats are extremely reckless when it comes to his own country\u2019s security. They are damaging to Ethiopia\u2019s relations in the wider region. Djibouti, which now provides Ethiopia\u2019s main access to the sea, has furiously responded that its \u201cterritorial integrity cannot be disputed\u201d. Somalia, similarly, insisted its territorial integrity and sovereignty are \u201csacrosanct and not open for discussion\u201d.\nSome Ethiopian officials play down Abiy\u2019s fighting talk. \u201cIt\u2019s about diverting attention from domestic issues,\u201d says an ally of the prime minister. Although the Eritrean port of Assab, which was once part of the former Ethiopian Empire, has particular symbolic value for Ethiopians, Abiy has also floated the possibility of negotiating for a strip of land around the ancient port of Zeila in the breakaway Somali region of Somaliland. In exchange, Ethiopia might offer to recognise Somaliland statehood. \u201cAbiy has no interest in being part of another conflict for the moment,\u201d says an analyst in Addis Ababa.\nBut the Ethiopian prime minister is notoriously unpredictable. \u201cNobody except himself can be certain if he is serious or not,\u201d says a TPLF official. Little more than three years ago Abiy insisted he would not go to war in Tigray. Many diplomats and regional leaders took him at his word, which he soon broke. They would be wise not to make the same mistake again. \u25a0", "description": "Abiy Ahmed\u2019s push for access to the sea has rattled his neighbours", "ogDescription": "Abiy Ahmed\u2019s push for
