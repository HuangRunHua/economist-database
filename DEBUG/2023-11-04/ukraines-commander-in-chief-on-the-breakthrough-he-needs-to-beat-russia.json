Over the past few months, Ukraine has taken the war into the peninsula, which remains critical to the logistics of the conflict. \u201cIt must know that it is part of Ukraine and that this war is happening there.\u201d On October 30th Ukraine struck Crimea with American-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for the first time.  \nGeneral Zaluzhny is desperately trying to prevent the war from settling into the trenches. \u201cThe biggest risk of an attritional trench war is that it can drag on for years and wear down the Ukrainian state,\u201d he says.  In the first world war, politics interfered before technology could make a difference. Four empires collapsed and a revolution broke out in Russia. \nMr Putin is counting on a collapse in Ukrainian morale and Western support. There is no question in General Zaluzhny\u2019s mind that a long war favours Russia, which has a population three times and an economy ten times the size of Ukraine. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s a feudal state where the cheapest resource is human life. And for us\u2026the most expensive thing we have is our people,\u201d he says.  For now he has enough soldiers. But the longer the war goes on, the harder it will be to sustain. \u201cWe need to look for this solution, we need to find this gunpowder, quickly master it and use it for a speedy victory. Because sooner or later we are going to find that we simply don\u2019t have enough people to fight.\u201d \u25a0\nRead a more detailed new essay by General Zaluzhny on this topic.\nStay on top of our

Ukraine has managed to advance by just 17 kilometres. Russia fought for ten months around Bakhmut in the east \u201cto take a town six by six kilometres\u201d. Sharing his first comprehensive assessment of the campaign with The Economist in an interview this week, Ukraine\u2019s commander-in-chief, General Valery Zaluzhny, says the battlefield reminds him of the great conflict of a century ago. \u201cJust like in the first world war we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,\u201d he says. The general concludes that it would take a massive technological leap to break the deadlock. \u201cThere will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.\u201d \nRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\n\nThe course of the counter-offensive has undermined Western hopes that Ukraine could use it to demonstrate that the war is unwinnable, forcing Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, to negotiate. It has also undercut General Zaluzhny\u2019s assumption that he could stop Russia by bleeding its troops. \u201cThat was my mistake. Russia has lost at least 150,000 dead. In any other country such casualties would have stopped the war.\u201d But not in Russia, where life is cheap and where Mr Putin\u2019s reference points are the first and second world wars, in which Russia lost tens of millions. \nAn army of Ukraine\u2019s standard ought to have been able to move at a speed of 30km a day as it breached Russian lines. \u201cIf you look at NATO\u2019s text books and at the maths which we did, four months should have been enough time for us to have reached Crimea, to have fought in Crimea, to return from Crimea and to have gone back in and out again,\u201d General Zaluzhny says sardonically. Instead he watched his troops get stuck in minefields on the approaches to Bakhmut in the east, his Western-supplied equipment getting pummelled by Russian artillery and drones. The same story unfolded on the offensive\u2019s main thrust in the south, where inexperienced brigades immediately ran into trouble.\n\u201cFirst I thought there was something wrong with our commanders, so I changed some of them. Then I thought maybe our soldiers are not fit for purpose, so I moved soldiers in some brigades,\u201d says General Zaluzhny. When those changes failed to make a difference, the general told his staff to dig out a book he once saw as a student. Its title was \u201cBreaching Fortified Defence Lines\u201d. It was published in 1941 by a Soviet major-general, P.S. Smirnov, who analysed the battles of the first world war. \u201cAnd before I got even halfway through it, I realised that is exactly where we are because just like then, the level of our technological development today has put both us and our enemies in a stupor.\u201d\n\nThat thesis, he says, was borne out as he went to the front line in Avdiivka, also in the east, where Russia has recently advanced by a few hundred metres over several weeks by throwing in two of its armies. \u201cOn our monitor screens the day I was there we saw 140 Russian machines ablaze\u2014destroyed within four hours of coming within firing range of our artillery.\u201d Those fleeing were chased by \u201cfirst-person-view\u201d drones, remote-controlled and carrying explosive charges that their operators simply crash into the enemy. The same picture unfolds when Ukrainian troops try to advance. General Zaluzhny describes a battlefield in which modern sensors can identify any concentration of forces, and modern precision weapons can destroy it. \u201cThe simple fact is that we see everything the enemy is doing and they see everything we are doing. In order for us to break this deadlock we need something new, like the gunpowder which the Chinese invented and which we are still using to kill each other,\u201d he says. \nThis time, however, the decisive factor will be not a single new invention, but will come from combining all the technical solutions that already exist, he says. In a By Invitation article written for The Economist by General Zaluzhny, as well as in an essay shared with the newspaper, he urges innovation in drones, electronic warfare, anti-artillery capabilities and demining equipment, as well as in the use of robotics. \nWestern allies have been overly cautious in supplying Ukraine with their latest technology and more powerful weapons. Joe Biden, America\u2019s president, set objectives at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion: to ensure that Ukraine was not defeated and that America was not dragged into confrontation with Russia. This means that arms supplied by the West have been sufficient in sustaining Ukraine in the war, but not enough to allow it to win. General Zaluzhny is not complaining: \u201cThey are not obliged to give us anything, and we are grateful for what we have got, but I am simply stating the facts.\u201d\nYet by holding back the supply of long-range missile systems and tanks, the West allowed Russia to regroup and build up its defences in the aftermath of a sudden breakthrough in Kharkiv region in the north and in Kherson in the south late in 2022. \u201cThese systems were most relevant to us last year, but they only arrived this year,\u201d he says. Similarly, F-16 jets, due next year, are now less helpful, suggests the general, in part because Russia has improved its air defences: an experimental version of the S-400 missile system can reach beyond the city of Dnipro, he warns.\nThe delay in arms deliveries, though frustrating, is not the main cause of Ukraine\u2019s predicament, according to General Zaluzhny. \u201cIt is important to understand that this war cannot be won with the weapons of the past generation and outdated methods,\u201d he insists. \u201cThey will inevitably lead to delay and, as a consequence, defeat.\u201d It is, instead, technology that will be decisive, he argues. The general is enthused by recent conversations with Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, and stresses the decisive role of drones, and of electronic warfare which can prevent them from flying.\nGeneral Zaluzhny\u2019s assessment is sobering: there is no sign that a technological breakthrough, whether in drones or in electronic warfare, is around the corner. And technology has its limits. Even in the first world war, the arrival of tanks in 1917 was not sufficient to break the deadlock on the battlefield. It took a suite of technologies, and more than a decade of tactical innovation, to produce the German blitzkrieg in May 1940. The implication is that Ukraine is stuck in a long war\u2014one in which he acknowledges Russia has the advantage. Nevertheless, he insists that Ukraine has no choice but to keep the initiative by remaining on the offensive, even if it only moves by a few metres a day. \nCrimea, the general believes, remains Mr Putin\u2019s greatest vulnerability. His legitimacy rests on having brought it back to Russia in 2014. Over the past few months, Ukraine has taken the war into the peninsula, which remains critical to the logistics of the conflict. \u201cIt must know that it is part of Ukraine and that this war is happening there.\u201d On October 30th Ukraine struck Crimea with American-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for the first time.  \nGeneral Zaluzhny is desperately trying to prevent the war from settling into the trenches. \u201cThe biggest risk of an attritional trench war is that it can drag on for years and wear down the Ukrainian state,\u201d he says.  In the first world war, politics interfered before technology could make a difference. Four empires collapsed and a revolution broke out in Russia. \nMr Putin is counting on a collapse in Ukrainian morale and Western support. There is no question in General Zaluzhny\u2019s mind that a long war favours Russia, which has a population three times and an economy ten times the size of Ukraine. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s a feudal state where the cheapest resource is human life. And for us\u2026the most expensive thing we have is our people,\u201d he says.  For now he has enough soldiers. But the longer the war goes on, the harder it will be to sustain. \u201cWe need to look for this solution, we need to find this gunpowder, quickly master it and use it for a speedy victory. Because sooner or later we are going to find that we simply don\u2019t have enough people to fight.\u201d \u25a0\nRead a more detailed new essay by General Zaluzhny on this topic.\nStay on top of our
