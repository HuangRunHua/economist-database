"Business", "section": "The world this week", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-world-this-week/2023/04/20/business", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Elon Musk said he would launch a new artificial- intelligence platform called TruthGPT as a rival to ChatGPT and other generative-AI bots, somewhat contradicting his recent call for a moratorium on developing such technology. But Mr Musk reiterated his concerns about AI\u2019s potential to cause harm, even claiming it could cause the destruction of civilisation. It has emerged that Mr Musk has created a new company, X.AI, incorporated in Nevada. \nThe X files\nMr Musk\u2019s fascination with the letter X extends to Twitter, which has now changed its official company name to X Corp and moved its incorporation location from Delaware to Nevada. Mr Musk has a long-stated goal of creating X, \u201can everything app\u201d. \nSundar Pichai, Google\u2019s boss, warned that the world was not ready for the rapid changes that new AI will bring, saying it would \u201cimpact every product across every company\u201d (though that isn\u2019t stopping Google from racing ahead to integrate generative AI into its advertising, according to a report). Mr Pichai said the problem of fake imagery would become much worse. In one recent example an image of Pope Francis in a white puffer coat went viral on social media before it was revealed to have been generated by AI. \nFox News reached a settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over the broadcaster\u2019s fake claims that Dominion\u2019s machines helped \u201csteal\u201d the election in 2020 from Donald Trump. The $787.5m settlement is the biggest ever in a media defamation case. The deal was reached just ahead of a trial that would have called Rupert Murdoch, who controls Fox, as a witness. In pre-trial hearings the judge had dismissed Fox\u2019s claim that it was merely reporting allegations, and said the jury\u2019s task would be to determine if it had acted maliciously. \nBritain\u2019s annual rate of inflation dipped in March to 10.1%, still stubbornly high and now twice America\u2019s rate of 5%. Food prices rose the most in 45 years. Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, promises to cut inflation by half this year. \n\nChina\u2019s economy grew by 4.5% in the first quarter, year on year, beating the expectations of most economists. The government lifted its zero-covid restrictions in December, reopening the country to pent-up demand. The statistics bureau warned, however, that the  recovery is not yet solid. \nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March didn\u2019t harm business at most of America\u2019s big banks in the first quarter. Net profit was up by around 50% at JPMorgan Chase, year on year, 32% at Wells Fargo, 15% at Bank of America and 7% at Citigroup. Profit plummeted by 18% at Goldman Sachs, however, because of poor revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities trading. Profit was also down at Morgan Stanley, by 19%.\nCredit Suisse can\u2019t get a break. After collapsing in March, the bank faced claims this week from American senators that it had hampered an investigation into the \u201chistorical servicing of Nazi\u201d accounts, which in some cases continued until 2020. The claims relate to an investigation by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. Credit Suisse released the results of an independent inquiry that refutes the allegations. \nHSBC\u2019s biggest shareholder increased pressure on the bank to hive off its Asian business. Ping An, a giant Chinese insurer, which owns around 8% of HSBC, presented its plan in public for the first time, and said that HSBC was \u201cexaggerating\u201d the risks of the proposal. \nA $6.9bn charge related to up to 70,000 claims that its talcum powder causes cancer drove Johnson & Johnson to a small quarterly loss. The proposed settlement totals $8.9bn, making it one of the largest-ever liability payouts at an American company. \nTesla\u2019s aggressive price cuts of its cars drove a 24% rise in revenue in the latest quarter, year on year. But the lower prices hit net profit, which fell, also by 24%. \nFilm adaptation\nNetflix netted another 1.75m subscribers in the first quarter, taking its global users to 232.5m. That was a 4.9% increase, year on year, better than in the previous two quarters but a far cry from the 20%-plus it racked up during the pandemic. The streaming giant is delaying a crackdown on sharing passwords, after pilot schemes caused people to cancel their subscriptions. The company also said it would end its DVD-mailing service, which started off the business in 1997, in September. \nApple opened its first stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s boss, attended the grand openings. He also met Narendra Modi, the prime minister; Apple is expanding manufacturing in the country. Costly iPhones are out of reach for most Indians and are a small share of the market. Still, Apple is tapping into steady growth in the premium-phone sector, as India\u2019s middle class gets richer.", "description": "", "ogDescription": "", "imageUrl":
