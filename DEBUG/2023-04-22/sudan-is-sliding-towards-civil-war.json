This is a fight over who will control the direction of Sudan\u2019s political transition, which began four years ago with the overthrow of the brutal Islamist regime led by the former dictator, Omar al-Bashir. \nDemocracy crushed\nMr Bashir was forced out of power in 2019 after months of protests led by an alliance of pro-democracy activists. Sensing Mr Bashir\u2019s time was up, his own generals\u2014among them General Burhan and Mr Dagalo\u2014staged a coup to eject him. Protest leaders and the armed forces then struck a power-sharing deal which was supposed to lead to elections and a civilian government. But Mr Bashir\u2019s divide-and-rule tactics, honed over his three decades in charge, left behind a time-bomb: a motley group of militias and armed factions now jockeying for power. \nThe most powerful and prominent is the RSF. Mr Bashir created it as a counterweight to the army and the intelligence service, with its own command structure and funding. The man at its helm, Mr Dagalo, makes no secret of his ambition to rule. \nNeither does General Burhan, who also rose to prominence under Mr Bashir and sees himself as custodian of the army\u2019s interests, including its sprawling business empire. Sudan\u2019s armed forces have dominated its politics since independence in 1956. Both of the country\u2019s previous experiments in democracy\u2014in 1964 and 1985\u2014were crushed by soldiers. General Burhan, who is also backed by powerful Islamist groups linked to Mr Bashir\u2019s regime, dealt democracy its latest blow in 2021, when he carried out a second coup against the civilian leaders of a transitional government set up after the ouster of Mr Bashir. The country has been in turmoil ever since.\nIn December, leaders of the civilian bloc and the junta signed a provisional accord promising a fully civilian government and elections in two years. If implemented, it would help Sudan\u2019s collapsing economy by opening the door to foreign aid and debt relief. But it would also mean the integration of the RSF into the SAF, and the creation of a single national army under civilian oversight. A final agreement was due to be signed in early April. \nThe prospect of a settlement appears to have hastened a showdown. Both men stand to lose from the agreement, which would reduce the power of the armed forces in politics and the economy. Loth to hand over command of his force, Mr Dagalo insisted on being given a decade to integrate the RSF into the national army, while still claiming that he supported the agreement. General Burhan is said to have wanted this to happen within two years in order to defang his rival and to ensure the pre-eminence of the SAF.\nMore fundamentally, neither he nor the Islamist old guard around him would accept any deal that really curbed the SAF\u2019s business interests. Mr Dagalo\u2019s additional demand, in the most recent round of negotiations, that more than 800 senior officers be removed from the SAF as part of the integration process, was \u201csimply too much\u201d for General Burhan, notes Jonas Horner, an expert on the region. In early April an Islamist official from Mr Bashir\u2019s party, now outlawed, told Reuters that their group was trying to prevent the pending deal.\nIslamists within the army may therefore have decided to launch a quick strike in order to \u201creassert Islamist control over the transition and the country\u201d, argues Mr Horner. In recent months both sides have steadily built up their forces and reinforced their positions in the capital and other strategic places. Tanks were spotted moving over the Nile in Khartoum. General Burhan and Mr Dagalo were said to be no longer on speaking terms in the days before the start of the fighting. \nThe danger of a wider conflagration is considerable. Both the SAF and the RSF have extensive ethnic and patronage networks across Sudan. The Islamists around General Burhan are especially well entrenched in the Sudanese state and economy. As both of these unravel, lawlessness is spreading. In Khartoum, gunmen fired on an American diplomatic convoy and attacked the EU\u2019s ambassador in his home. In Nyala, South Darfur, armed men on motorbikes are robbing people in the streets, says Mohammed Osman of Alberdi, a Sudanese rights group. Warehouses belonging to aid agencies have been stripped bare.\nThe involvement of other countries in the region could also complicate matters. Mr Burhan has the political support of neighbouring Egypt. He may also have its military backing. The Wall Street Journal reported that an Egyptian jet had struck an RSF ammunition dump. Videos released by the RSF on April 15th showed captured Egyptian soldiers or pilots and jets at the Merowe air base. Egypt denies any military involvement in the conflict.\nMr Dagalo, by contrast, is close to Khalifa Haftar, a Libyan warlord, and to Issaias Afwerki, the president of Eritrea, who has a long history of meddling in the affairs of his neighbours. Mr Haftar has reportedly sent a shipment of arms to the RSF. Both Mr Haftar and Mr Dagalo have been backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the past, and RSF troops have fought for Saudi Arabia and the uae in their war in Yemen.\nIn a clear bid to win Gulf support for his own war, Mr Dagalo claims he is fighting against \u201cradical Islamists who hope to keep Sudan isolated\u201d. So far neither man appears to be doing much to stop the fighting. Mr Dagalo has also ludicrously claimed he is fighting to \u201cprotect democracy and uphold rule of law\u201d, omitting to mention that in 2019 the RSF massacred more than 100 peaceful pro-democracy protesters. \nIn the balance\nIt is still too early to tell which side will prevail. The national force controls the skies, which is why Mr Dagalo\u2019s men seem to have concentrated on seizing Sudan\u2019s airfields. It also has tanks and the heavier weaponry. But in Khartoum neither appears to have landed a decisive blow. Perhaps if Mr Dagalo is eventually run out of the capital, he will try to hole up in his tribal base in Darfur. That risks turning what is for now a narrow fight between two factions into a wider civil war between regions and ethnic groups. But if he is killed, the RSF could splinter, which might be a recipe for anarchy.\nNone of this bodes well for Sudan\u2019s troubled but once hopeful transition to democracy. Unable to see any light at the end of the tunnel, civilians caught in the middle are now trying to flee Khartoum to seek safety in the countryside. \u201cWe don\u2019t back either side,\u201d says Ahmed Ismat, a protest leader in Khartoum. \u201cAny war means the end of the revolution.\u201d \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Sliding towards

capital, have woken to the thunder of air strikes and the crackle of nearby gunfire. In just the first four days of fighting between the forces of two rival Sudanese generals, nearly 300 people have been killed (most of them civilians) and more than 2,600 injured. Armed men have been raiding and looting homes. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Call of Duty\u2019,\u201d says a resident whose house was struck by a bullet. Food, water and medical supplies are starting to run out. \nThe warning signs of an impending crisis were not hard to read. For months tensions had been building between the two most powerful figures in Sudan\u2019s military government: General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan\u2019s de facto leader since a coup in 2019; and Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as Hemedti), a warlord. He is the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary unit that grew out of the Janjaweed militias accused of genocidal acts of murder and rape in Darfur. Many warned of an impending clash between the RSF and the government\u2019s Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) loyal to General Burhan.\nThe crisis worsened fast in the morning of April 13th, when residents of Merowe, in northern Sudan, saw soldiers from the RSF rolling through town and taking up positions around the airport, a base for fighter jets. In response, SAF soldiers surrounded the RSF men and reportedly ordered them to withdraw. Soon the government warned of an imminent confrontation between the two forces, as did representatives of America, the European Union and several other Western governments. Over the next 24 hours, diplomats dashed between the two camps trying to head off a conflict. In Khartoum, residents braced for the worst. \nIt came early in the morning of April 15th as fighting broke out between the SAF and RSF. Each side accused the other of shooting first. According to the national army, Mr Dagalo\u2019s forces had launched a rebellion against the state. The RSF replied that the army had in fact launched a \u201csweeping attack\u201d against its members. Mr Dagalo called his boss a \u201ccriminal\u201d who would either be captured or \u201cdie like a dog\u201d. Both sides claimed to have swiftly gained the upper hand. \nWithin hours of the first shots being fired, tanks were driving through the streets of central Khartoum as fighter jets screamed overhead. As the air force bombed RSF bases, the RSF attacked the international airport; videos circulating online showed thick clouds of smoke rising from the tarmac. Clashes have occurred in the area around the state broadcaster and the presidential palace. Soldiers from both sides fired rockets near residential homes where civilians cowered. \u201cWe are hearing very heavy artillery,\u201d said one resident of central Khartoum by text message. \u201cThe voices and sounds are terrifying.\u201d\n\nFighting has also spread to other parts of Sudan (see map). Almost immediately the RSF claimed to have captured the airport at Merowe. Heavy gunfire was also reported near the el-Obeid air base in the North Kordofan region, as well as in multiple places in Darfur; three un aid workers were killed in clashes between the two armies in the city of el-Fasher. It is still unclear whether the conflict will blow up into a full-scale war. But neither man appears inclined to stop the violence and negotiate. Temporary ceasefires brokered by mediators have collapsed in minutes. \nBehind the latest clashes is a struggle for power between General Burhan and Mr Dagalo, and between the complex constellations of political parties, militias, rebel leaders and foreign powers allied to them. This is a fight over who will control the direction of Sudan\u2019s political transition, which began four years ago with the overthrow of the brutal Islamist regime led by the former dictator, Omar al-Bashir. \nDemocracy crushed\nMr Bashir was forced out of power in 2019 after months of protests led by an alliance of pro-democracy activists. Sensing Mr Bashir\u2019s time was up, his own generals\u2014among them General Burhan and Mr Dagalo\u2014staged a coup to eject him. Protest leaders and the armed forces then struck a power-sharing deal which was supposed to lead to elections and a civilian government. But Mr Bashir\u2019s divide-and-rule tactics, honed over his three decades in charge, left behind a time-bomb: a motley group of militias and armed factions now jockeying for power. \nThe most powerful and prominent is the RSF. Mr Bashir created it as a counterweight to the army and the intelligence service, with its own command structure and funding. The man at its helm, Mr Dagalo, makes no secret of his ambition to rule. \nNeither does General Burhan, who also rose to prominence under Mr Bashir and sees himself as custodian of the army\u2019s interests, including its sprawling business empire. Sudan\u2019s armed forces have dominated its politics since independence in 1956. Both of the country\u2019s previous experiments in democracy\u2014in 1964 and 1985\u2014were crushed by soldiers. General Burhan, who is also backed by powerful Islamist groups linked to Mr Bashir\u2019s regime, dealt democracy its latest blow in 2021, when he carried out a second coup against the civilian leaders of a transitional government set up after the ouster of Mr Bashir. The country has been in turmoil ever since.\nIn December, leaders of the civilian bloc and the junta signed a provisional accord promising a fully civilian government and elections in two years. If implemented, it would help Sudan\u2019s collapsing economy by opening the door to foreign aid and debt relief. But it would also mean the integration of the RSF into the SAF, and the creation of a single national army under civilian oversight. A final agreement was due to be signed in early April. \nThe prospect of a settlement appears to have hastened a showdown. Both men stand to lose from the agreement, which would reduce the power of the armed forces in politics and the economy. Loth to hand over command of his force, Mr Dagalo insisted on being given a decade to integrate the RSF into the national army, while still claiming that he supported the agreement. General Burhan is said to have wanted this to happen within two years in order to defang his rival and to ensure the pre-eminence of the SAF.\nMore fundamentally, neither he nor the Islamist old guard around him would accept any deal that really curbed the SAF\u2019s business interests. Mr Dagalo\u2019s additional demand, in the most recent round of negotiations, that more than 800 senior officers be removed from the SAF as part of the integration process, was \u201csimply too much\u201d for General Burhan, notes Jonas Horner, an expert on the region. In early April an Islamist official from Mr Bashir\u2019s party, now outlawed, told Reuters that their group was trying to prevent the pending deal.\nIslamists within the army may therefore have decided to launch a quick strike in order to \u201creassert Islamist control over the transition and the country\u201d, argues Mr Horner. In recent months both sides have steadily built up their forces and reinforced their positions in the capital and other strategic places. Tanks were spotted moving over the Nile in Khartoum. General Burhan and Mr Dagalo were said to be no longer on speaking terms in the days before the start of the fighting. \nThe danger of a wider conflagration is considerable. Both the SAF and the RSF have extensive ethnic and patronage networks across Sudan. The Islamists around General Burhan are especially well entrenched in the Sudanese state and economy. As both of these unravel, lawlessness is spreading. In Khartoum, gunmen fired on an American diplomatic convoy and attacked the EU\u2019s ambassador in his home. In Nyala, South Darfur, armed men on motorbikes are robbing people in the streets, says Mohammed Osman of Alberdi, a Sudanese rights group. Warehouses belonging to aid agencies have been stripped bare.\nThe involvement of other countries in the region could also complicate matters. Mr Burhan has the political support of neighbouring Egypt. He may also have its military backing. The Wall Street Journal reported that an Egyptian jet had struck an RSF ammunition dump. Videos released by the RSF on April 15th showed captured Egyptian soldiers or pilots and jets at the Merowe air base. Egypt denies any military involvement in the conflict.\nMr Dagalo, by contrast, is close to Khalifa Haftar, a Libyan warlord, and to Issaias Afwerki, the president of Eritrea, who has a long history of meddling in the affairs of his neighbours. Mr Haftar has reportedly sent a shipment of arms to the RSF. Both Mr Haftar and Mr Dagalo have been backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the past, and RSF troops have fought for Saudi Arabia and the uae in their war in Yemen.\nIn a clear bid to win Gulf support for his own war, Mr Dagalo claims he is fighting against \u201cradical Islamists who hope to keep Sudan isolated\u201d. So far neither man appears to be doing much to stop the fighting. Mr Dagalo has also ludicrously claimed he is fighting to \u201cprotect democracy and uphold rule of law\u201d, omitting to mention that in 2019 the RSF massacred more than 100 peaceful pro-democracy protesters. \nIn the balance\nIt is still too early to tell which side will prevail. The national force controls the skies, which is why Mr Dagalo\u2019s men seem to have concentrated on seizing Sudan\u2019s airfields. It also has tanks and the heavier weaponry. But in Khartoum neither appears to have landed a decisive blow. Perhaps if Mr Dagalo is eventually run out of the capital, he will try to hole up in his tribal base in Darfur. That risks turning what is for now a narrow fight between two factions into a wider civil war between regions and ethnic groups. But if he is killed, the RSF could splinter, which might be a recipe for anarchy.\nNone of this bodes well for Sudan\u2019s troubled but once hopeful transition to democracy. Unable to see any light at the end of the tunnel, civilians caught in the middle are now trying to flee Khartoum to seek safety in the countryside. \u201cWe don\u2019t back either side,\u201d says Ahmed Ismat, a protest leader in Khartoum. \u201cAny war means the end of the revolution.\u201d \u25a0", "description": "Fighting between rival Sudanese generals could trigger ethnic conflict",
