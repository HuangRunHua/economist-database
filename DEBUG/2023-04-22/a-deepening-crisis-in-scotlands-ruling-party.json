Scottish National Party (SNP) and first minister of Scotland on February 15th, she declared she wanted a more private life. If anything, the glare of attention has intensified. \nOn April 5th police arrested and released without charge Peter Murrell, Ms Sturgeon\u2019s husband, who also served as the SNP\u2019s former chief executive. Cops are investigating claims that \u00a3667,000 ($829,000) raised to support a second referendum on Scottish independence was improperly spent on other things. They confiscated a swanky motorhome from the driveway of Mr Murrell\u2019s elderly mother. On April 18th police arrested and released without charge Colin Beattie, the party\u2019s treasurer (who stepped back from the role the following day). The men are two of three \u201cregistered officers\u201d on the party\u2019s accounts. The third is Ms Sturgeon; Holyrood is rife with speculation that she will be questioned, too. \nHumza Yousaf, elected by SNP members to replace Ms Sturgeon on March 27th, appears powerless to contain the chaos. Unlike his imperious predecessor, Mr Yousaf cuts a rather passive figure. So far he has acted more like a bemused narrator of the mess rather than the new broom who will clean it all up. \u201cI\u2019ll have to speak to Colin Beattie. My understanding is he\u2019s still in the police station being questioned,\u201d he declared, when first asked whether Mr Beattie could continue to sit on a party committee. \u201cYes, of course I\u2019m surprised when one of my colleagues has been arrested,\u201d he added, in a quote for the ages. \nMr Yousaf was the source of the revelation that the SNP had been without auditors for six months, after the previous firm\u2019s resignation in October. He was unaware of that until he became leader, he said. His closest rival for the leadership, Kate Forbes, declares it all \u201cmindblowing\u201d. \u201cWe need decisive and quick action or we will be in trouble,\u201d she said, in what sounded like a job application. \nNews of Mr Beattie\u2019s arrest broke hours before Mr Yousaf delivered the first major policy address of his term, optimistically titled: \u201cNew Leadership, A Fresh Start for Scotland\u201d. Mr Yousaf did indeed ditch chunks of Ms Sturgeon\u2019s agenda. But that was not so much born of political conviction\u2014he campaigned as her political apprentice\u2014but because it wasn\u2019t working.  A faltering bottle-deposit scheme will be delayed and plans to restrict alcohol advertising reconsidered. Of the second referendum Ms Sturgeon hankered for, there was not a word. \nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",
