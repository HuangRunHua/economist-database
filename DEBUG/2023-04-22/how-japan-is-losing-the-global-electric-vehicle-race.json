For decades, JATCO, like the rest of Japan\u2019s vaunted auto industry, has perfected carmaking. Japan has been at the forefront of the industry, pioneering just-in-time manufacturing and leading the development of hybrid cars. But the next big evolution\u2014the shift to electric vehicles (EVs)\u2014has become a source of angst. \u201cThe EV shift will be a big transformation, there\u2019s no denying that,\u201d says Sato Tomoyoshi, JATCO\u2019s CEO. \u201cOur company will have to change drastically.\u201d \nSo far, Japan and its carmakers are lagging in the race towards eVs, the industry\u2019s fastest-growing product area. Battery-powered electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) accounted for around 13% of all cars sold globally in 2022, up from 2.6% in 2019. In some markets, including China, the share is some 20%. But in Japan, it was just 2%. The firms pulling ahead in the EV race include newcomers, such as Tesla and China\u2019s BYD, and established giants such as Germany\u2019s Volkswagen. \n Keeping the flame alive\n\nJapanese carmakers are not among them. None is in the top 20 for global EV sales, even though Nissan and Mitsubishi released some of the world\u2019s first EVs more than a decade ago. Toyota, the world\u2019s largest car company, sold just 24,000 EVs out of its 10.5m in total sales in 2022. (Tesla sold 1.3m.) Sales of Toyota\u2019s first fully electric model, an SUV called the bZ4X, had to be paused last summer due to defects that caused the wheels to fall off. \nCritics worry that this early stalling on EVs could cause the wheels to fall off the Japanese auto industry at large. Some see parallels with semiconductors and consumer electronics, industries which Japanese firms initially dominated, then missed important trends abroad and ultimately lost out to nimbler competitors. A similar decline in the auto industry, which accounts for nearly 20% of Japan\u2019s exports and some 8% of Japanese jobs, would have huge economic and social implications.\nJapanese carmakers are revving to catch up. Toyota has a new cEO, Sato Koji, tapped in part to lead the company\u2019s push for electrification. At his first press conference on April 7th, Toyota announced plans to release ten new EV models and boost annual EV sales to 1.5m by 2026. \u201cWe will thoroughly implement electrification, which we can do immediately,\u201d said Mr Sato. \nHonda has plans to launch 30 EV models by 2030 and set up an EV joint venture with Sony last year. The company pitched a corporate reorganisation taking effect this month as an \u201celectrification acceleration\u201d. In February Nissan said it would release 19 new EV models by 2030; it now calls electrification the \u201ccore of our strategy\u201d. \nJapan\u2019s slow start on EVs stems in part from its earlier successes\u2014or as Mr Sato of JATCO puts it, it is a classic case of the innovator\u2019s dilemma. Industry leaders hesitated to embrace a new technology that might undermine areas in which Japan leads, such as standard hybrid vehicles, which combine an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor powered by batteries that capture energy from regenerative braking (rather than charging with outside electricity, as with PHEVs). Engineers at Japanese firms that fine-tuned complex hybrids were also unimpressed by eVs, which are simpler mechanically. \u201cWithin the industry, there are still a lot of people attached to the engine,\u201d Mr Sato says. Executives worried about the implications of the EV shift on their network of suppliers such as jATCO, given that EVs require fewer parts and widgets than ICEs. Carmakers assumed eventually switching gears to EVs would be a cinch: \u201cThe logic was that when the time comes, we can easily shift from hybrids to EVs,\u201d says a former executive at a large Japanese car company. \nJapan also made an early wrong turn with hydrogen, another emergent auto technology with the potential to be carbon-free. Toyota, Japan\u2019s most influential carmaker, bet that using hydrogen fuel-cells would become the leading way to electrify cars. Abe Shinzo, Japan\u2019s prime minister from 2012 to 2020, championed policies to make Japan a \u201chydrogen society\u201d; in 2015, Toyota delivered its first hydrogen fuel-cell sedan, the Mirai, to Abe himself. While hydrogen may come to play a big role in decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors, such as steel production or fuelling long-haul trucks, it has so far turned out to make little sense as a technology to electrify light consumer vehicles. Even in Japan, which has built a fair amount of hydrogen-refuelling infrastructure, Toyota has struggled to peddle the pricey Mirai: the company has sold a total of just 7,500 fuel-cell vehicles in its home market. \nWhile governments in China, Europe and America have increasingly subsidised EVs as part of their climate policies, Japan has done less to incentivise their adoption. The government has called for 100% of vehicles sold by 2035 to be electrified. But that would include hybrid vehicles, in contrast to other governments which have defined the next generation of vehicles more narrowly. Subsidies for fuel-cell vehicles remain much larger in Japan than those for EVs. Strict regulation has hampered the expansion of EV charging infrastructure: Japan has roughly one-quarter as many public EV chargers as South Korea, its much smaller neighbour. \nNagging scepticism about EV technology explains some of Japan\u2019s wariness. Japanese carmakers and officials are \u201cstill questioning\u201d, says Tsuruhara Yoshiro of AutoInsight, an industry journal: \u201cAre EVs what consumers want? Do they provide value to them? Are they the best way to reduce CO2?\u201d Toyoda Akio, the previous Toyota CEO and grandson of the company\u2019s founder, liked to say that \u201ccarbon is the enemy, not the internal combustion engine.\u201d Even under Mr Sato, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr Toyoda, the company is sticking to what it calls a \u201cmulti-pathway\u201d strategy that sees EVs as one part of a diverse fleet. \u201cWe think that the way to get the most carbon-dioxide emissions reductions net overall throughout the world is to tune the solution for each part of the world,\u201d says Gill Pratt, Toyota\u2019s chief scientist. For example, in developing countries, where renewable energy uptake has generally been slower than in the West, traditional hybrids might offer a more practical and economical way to reduce emissions in the interim. \nBut some think Japan\u2019s carmakers are moving too late to catch up with the changing times in more developed markets. \u201cThey are like the Tokugawa shogun-era closed country\u2014they refused to see what is happening in the world,\u201d says Murasawa Yoshihisa, a management consultant. While Japanese cars were once synonymous with fuel efficiency and therefore environmentalism, they risk coming to stand for climate denialism. Japan\u2019s three biggest carmakers\u2014Toyota, Honda and Nissan\u2014rank lowest among the top ten global auto companies on decarbonisation efforts, according to a recent study by Greenpeace, an environmental group.\nAs Toyota\u2019s experience with the bZ4X suggests, designing and building top-of-the-line EVs may not be as simple as the Japanese firms assumed. \u201cThey were so overconfident that once they decide to do it, they will dominate the EV market,\u201d Mr Murasawa says. \u201cBut their offerings have turned out to be old-fashioned.\u201d Creating EVs that appeal to consumers requires putting more focus on software, while Japanese firms traditionally prioritise hardware. Even as they at last start gearing up, Japanese companies are already losing loyal customers. Japanese brands that \u201cbuilt a legacy\u201d in America have been \u201ccaught flat-footed in the context of 2022\u201d, concludes S&P Global Mobility, an American research outfit. As the study notes, consumers switching to EVs in 2022 were largely moving away from Toyota and Honda. \u25a0\nFor more coverage of climate change, sign up for the Climate Issue, our fortnightly

confidence. Diligent inspectors appraise the gears and pulleys that make up the Japanese car-parts maker\u2019s transmission systems. Robots stamp parts and flip them onto production lines. For decades, JATCO, like the rest of Japan\u2019s vaunted auto industry, has perfected carmaking. Japan has been at the forefront of the industry, pioneering just-in-time manufacturing and leading the development of hybrid cars. But the next big evolution\u2014the shift to electric vehicles (EVs)\u2014has become a source of angst. \u201cThe EV shift will be a big transformation, there\u2019s no denying that,\u201d says Sato Tomoyoshi, JATCO\u2019s CEO. \u201cOur company will have to change drastically.\u201d \nSo far, Japan and its carmakers are lagging in the race towards eVs, the industry\u2019s fastest-growing product area. Battery-powered electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) accounted for around 13% of all cars sold globally in 2022, up from 2.6% in 2019. In some markets, including China, the share is some 20%. But in Japan, it was just 2%. The firms pulling ahead in the EV race include newcomers, such as Tesla and China\u2019s BYD, and established giants such as Germany\u2019s Volkswagen. \n Keeping the flame alive\n\nJapanese carmakers are not among them. None is in the top 20 for global EV sales, even though Nissan and Mitsubishi released some of the world\u2019s first EVs more than a decade ago. Toyota, the world\u2019s largest car company, sold just 24,000 EVs out of its 10.5m in total sales in 2022. (Tesla sold 1.3m.) Sales of Toyota\u2019s first fully electric model, an SUV called the bZ4X, had to be paused last summer due to defects that caused the wheels to fall off. \nCritics worry that this early stalling on EVs could cause the wheels to fall off the Japanese auto industry at large. Some see parallels with semiconductors and consumer electronics, industries which Japanese firms initially dominated, then missed important trends abroad and ultimately lost out to nimbler competitors. A similar decline in the auto industry, which accounts for nearly 20% of Japan\u2019s exports and some 8% of Japanese jobs, would have huge economic and social implications.\nJapanese carmakers are revving to catch up. Toyota has a new cEO, Sato Koji, tapped in part to lead the company\u2019s push for electrification. At his first press conference on April 7th, Toyota announced plans to release ten new EV models and boost annual EV sales to 1.5m by 2026. \u201cWe will thoroughly implement electrification, which we can do immediately,\u201d said Mr Sato. \nHonda has plans to launch 30 EV models by 2030 and set up an EV joint venture with Sony last year. The company pitched a corporate reorganisation taking effect this month as an \u201celectrification acceleration\u201d. In February Nissan said it would release 19 new EV models by 2030; it now calls electrification the \u201ccore of our strategy\u201d. \nJapan\u2019s slow start on EVs stems in part from its earlier successes\u2014or as Mr Sato of JATCO puts it, it is a classic case of the innovator\u2019s dilemma. Industry leaders hesitated to embrace a new technology that might undermine areas in which Japan leads, such as standard hybrid vehicles, which combine an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor powered by batteries that capture energy from regenerative braking (rather than charging with outside electricity, as with PHEVs). Engineers at Japanese firms that fine-tuned complex hybrids were also unimpressed by eVs, which are simpler mechanically. \u201cWithin the industry, there are still a lot of people attached to the engine,\u201d Mr Sato says. Executives worried about the implications of the EV shift on their network of suppliers such as jATCO, given that EVs require fewer parts and widgets than ICEs. Carmakers assumed eventually switching gears to EVs would be a cinch: \u201cThe logic was that when the time comes, we can easily shift from hybrids to EVs,\u201d says a former executive at a large Japanese car company. \nJapan also made an early wrong turn with hydrogen, another emergent auto technology with the potential to be carbon-free. Toyota, Japan\u2019s most influential carmaker, bet that using hydrogen fuel-cells would become the leading way to electrify cars. Abe Shinzo, Japan\u2019s prime minister from 2012 to 2020, championed policies to make Japan a \u201chydrogen society\u201d; in 2015, Toyota delivered its first hydrogen fuel-cell sedan, the Mirai, to Abe himself. While hydrogen may come to play a big role in decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors, such as steel production or fuelling long-haul trucks, it has so far turned out to make little sense as a technology to electrify light consumer vehicles. Even in Japan, which has built a fair amount of hydrogen-refuelling infrastructure, Toyota has struggled to peddle the pricey Mirai: the company has sold a total of just 7,500 fuel-cell vehicles in its home market. \nWhile governments in China, Europe and America have increasingly subsidised EVs as part of their climate policies, Japan has done less to incentivise their adoption. The government has called for 100% of vehicles sold by 2035 to be electrified. But that would include hybrid vehicles, in contrast to other governments which have defined the next generation of vehicles more narrowly. Subsidies for fuel-cell vehicles remain much larger in Japan than those for EVs. Strict regulation has hampered the expansion of EV charging infrastructure: Japan has roughly one-quarter as many public EV chargers as South Korea, its much smaller neighbour. \nNagging scepticism about EV technology explains some of Japan\u2019s wariness. Japanese carmakers and officials are \u201cstill questioning\u201d, says Tsuruhara Yoshiro of AutoInsight, an industry journal: \u201cAre EVs what consumers want? Do they provide value to them? Are they the best way to reduce CO2?\u201d Toyoda Akio, the previous Toyota CEO and grandson of the company\u2019s founder, liked to say that \u201ccarbon is the enemy, not the internal combustion engine.\u201d Even under Mr Sato, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr Toyoda, the company is sticking to what it calls a \u201cmulti-pathway\u201d strategy that sees EVs as one part of a diverse fleet. \u201cWe think that the way to get the most carbon-dioxide emissions reductions net overall throughout the world is to tune the solution for each part of the world,\u201d says Gill Pratt, Toyota\u2019s chief scientist. For example, in developing countries, where renewable energy uptake has generally been slower than in the West, traditional hybrids might offer a more practical and economical way to reduce emissions in the interim. \nBut some think Japan\u2019s carmakers are moving too late to catch up with the changing times in more developed markets. \u201cThey are like the Tokugawa shogun-era closed country\u2014they refused to see what is happening in the world,\u201d says Murasawa Yoshihisa, a management consultant. While Japanese cars were once synonymous with fuel efficiency and therefore environmentalism, they risk coming to stand for climate denialism. Japan\u2019s three biggest carmakers\u2014Toyota, Honda and Nissan\u2014rank lowest among the top ten global auto companies on decarbonisation efforts, according to a recent study by Greenpeace, an environmental group.\nAs Toyota\u2019s experience with the bZ4X suggests, designing and building top-of-the-line EVs may not be as simple as the Japanese firms assumed. \u201cThey were so overconfident that once they decide to do it, they will dominate the EV market,\u201d Mr Murasawa says. \u201cBut their offerings have turned out to be old-fashioned.\u201d Creating EVs that appeal to consumers requires putting more focus on software, while Japanese firms traditionally prioritise hardware. Even as they at last start gearing up, Japanese companies are already losing loyal customers. Japanese brands that \u201cbuilt a legacy\u201d in America have been \u201ccaught flat-footed in the context of 2022\u201d, concludes S&P Global Mobility, an American research outfit. As the study notes, consumers switching to EVs in 2022 were largely moving away from Toyota and Honda. \u25a0\nFor more coverage of climate change, sign up for the Climate Issue, our fortnightly
