updated on April 19th to take in Fox\u2019s settlement with Dominion.\nRESPECT THE audience; make money. That was how Rush Limbaugh explained his success on conservative talk radio in the early 1990s. Educated types derided his listeners\u2014religious, working-class people\u2014but he affirmed them and made things devilishly fun. The charge that he delivered \u201cmarching orders\u201d to \u201cmind-numbed robots\u201d had it all wrong, said Limbaugh, who died in 2021. Rather he listened to his listeners, and voiced their convictions. It was wonderful for ratings. \u201cThis is a business!\u201d, he once exclaimed.\nSome 30 years on the same principle drives Fox News, the cable-news network that brought Limbaugh\u2019s right-wing, populist sensibility to TV and, on April 18th, settled a mammoth defamation lawsuit over its coverage of the 2020 election. Dominion Voting Systems, a voting-technology firm, had sued for defamation, accusing the network of knowingly spreading a lie that Dominion\u2019s machines somehow threw the election to Joe Biden. Not since the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World, a now-defunct British tabloid, had an outlet in Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire landed in such a legal mess.\nFox will pay Dominion $787.5m, about half of what Dominion had first sought in damages. That figure dwarfs what is thought to be the second-largest defamation settlement involving a news outlet, the $177m paid by ABC News in 2017 to a meat producer whose products it reported were unsafe. The deal was struck moments before a trial was due to start in Delaware. That Dominion\u2019s lawsuit had proceeded so far was itself remarkable. Defamation cases are notoriously hard to win in America\u2014defendants must be shown to have knowingly published a lie (the legal standard is \u201cactual malice\u201d)\u2014deterring would-be plaintiffs from bringing them.\nBut what really made Dominion v Fox extraordinary were its revelations ahead of the trial. The lawsuit laid bare\u2014through the release of emails, texts and depositions of Fox staff and management\u2014the extent to which America\u2019s most popular cable network\u2019s coverage is shaped by a desire to tell its audience what it wants to hear and also by what its competitors are up to. And the case shed light on Fox\u2019s fractious relationship with the politician loved by many of its viewers, Donald Trump. \nFox\u2019s trouble started on election night. To Mr Trump\u2019s dismay it was the first outlet to call Arizona, a swing state, for Mr Biden (correctly). Later several Fox reporters challenged Mr Trump\u2019s claims that there had been widespread voter fraud. Such acts of journalism infuriated the outgoing president, who urged his supporters to switch to Newsmax and One America News, two upstart, fringe networks. That day the share price of Fox News\u2019s parent company, Fox Corporation, shed 6%. Many of his voters duly changed the channel. About two weeks after the election Newsmax\u2019s prime-time audience had tripled, to 412,000. Fox\u2019s fell by 37% to 3.5m. \nFox got on a \u201cwar footing\u201d, in the words of one executive. Suzanne Scott, the network\u2019s boss, vowed to \u201cplant flags letting the viewers know we hear them and respect them\u201d. A journalist who had corrected election-fraud lies was chastised. So was another whose reporting higher-ups deemed \u201csmug\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t keep defending these reporters who don\u2019t understand our viewers,\u201d wrote Ms Scott. The editor in charge of the Arizona decision was fired at the suggestion of Mr Murdoch, chair of Fox Corporation, who called the dismissal \u201ca big message with Trump people\u201d. \nMeanwhile Mr Trump\u2019s lawyers, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, sat for chummy, credulous interviews. They said that Dominion was owned by a Venezuelan company founded to rig elections for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and that the firm paid officials to alter votes. Both claims were made up. Privately people at the network called Ms Powell and Mr Giuliani kooks, full of \u201ccrazy stuff\u201d. But the audience ate it up. \u201cAny day with Rudy and Sidney is guaranteed gold!\u201d, wrote a producer to colleagues. \nCourt filings showed how quickly the network moved to appease Trumpy viewers and fend off outlets like Newsmax, whose ratings then fell back. (Their threat has thoroughly subsided: big cable distributors no longer carry One America News, and Newsmax was briefly dropped by DirectTV, a satellite provider, in January.) The filings also showed the extent of disdain that both Mr Murdoch and Tucker Carlson, the network\u2019s star host, had for Mr Trump. \u201cI hate him passionately,\u201d Mr Carlson wrote to a colleague a few days before the Capitol riot. \u201cWhat he\u2019s good at is destroying things. He\u2019s the undisputed world champion of that. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong.\u201d A couple of months earlier, Mr Murdoch wrote that Mr Trump was \u201cincreasingly mad\u201d.\nHaving followed the audience, as Limbaugh advised, Fox then attempted to lead it. For at least three months the network did not grant Mr Trump an interview, and tried hard instead to boost Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis. Aides to Mr DeSantis have fed story ideas and talking points to Fox, according to records obtained by the Tampa Bay Times. Mr DeSantis appeared on the network nearly once a day for months after the election of 2020. It is the kind of collaborative relationship Mr Murdoch seeks with conservative politicians and so unlike that with Mr Trump, who openly criticises the network on social media. \nBut the audience would not be led. During hearings of the January 6th Committee, the FBI\u2019s raid on Mar-a-Lago, or Mr Trump\u2019s indictment by Manhattan prosecutors, Fox rallied to Mr Trump\u2019s defence. \u201cThey can\u2019t move until their audience moves,\u201d says Nicole Hemmer, a historian of conservative media at Vanderbilt University. Mr Murdoch appears to agree. \u201c[Leading] our viewers\u2026is not as easy as it might seem,\u201d he wrote after the Capitol riot. Mr Carlson recently gave an hour-long cuddle of an interview to Mr Trump.\n\nAll of which is fascinating for students of Fox and its influence on the American right. But what of the lawsuit\u2019s damage? The network can pay the settlement, which is about a quarter of what analysts estimate that Fox News earned in revenue last year. Otherwise the impact is negligible, says A.J. Bauer of the University of Alabama. Viewers will not have heard much about the lawsuit on Fox, since the network barely covered it; those who caught wind of it elsewhere were primed to take Fox\u2019s side. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why the lawsuit changes the way that Fox does business because the way it does business makes it money,\u201d says Mr Bauer. Though the network acknowledged the court\u2019s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false, it will not have to air any retractions or corrections. A doublespeakish statement from Fox said the settlement reflected its \u201ccommitment to the highest journalistic standards\u201d.\nMore legal trouble awaits Fox over its coverage of the 2020 election. Smartmatic, another voting-technology firm, is suing the company for $2.7bn. \u201cDominion\u2019s litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox\u2019s disinformation campaign,\u201d said Smartmatic after news of Dominion\u2019s settlement. It promised to \u201cexpose the rest\u201d. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and
