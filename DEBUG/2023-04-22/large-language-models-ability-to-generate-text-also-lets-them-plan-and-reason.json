Shakespearean sonnet. Trade theory explained by a pirate. A children\u2019s story about a space-faring dinosaur. People have had fun asking modern chatbots to produce all sorts of unusual text. Some requests have been useful in the real world\u2014think travel itineraries, school essays or computer code. Modern large language models (LLMs) can generate them all, though homework-shirkers should beware: the models may get some facts wrong, and are prone to flights of fancy that their creators call \u201challucinations\u201d.\nOccasional hiccups aside, all this represents tremendous progress. Even a few years ago, such programs would have been science fiction. But churning out writing on demand may not prove to be LLMs\u2019 most significant ability. Their text-generating prowess allows them to act as general-purpose reasoning engines. They can follow instructions, generate plans, and issue commands for other systems to carry out.\nAfter all, language is not just words, but \u201ca representation of the underlying complexity\u201d of the world, observes Percy Liang, a professor at the Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University. That means a model of how language works also contains, in some sense, a model of how the world works. An LLM trained on large amounts of text, says Nathan Benaich of Air Street Capital, an AI investment fund, \u201cbasically learns to reason on the basis of text completion\u201d.\nSystems that use LLMs to control other components are proliferating. For example, HuggingGPT, created at Zhejiang University and Microsoft Research, uses ChatGPT as a task planner, farming out user requests to AI models selected from Hugging Face, a library of models trained for text, image and audio tasks. TaskMatrix.AI, created by researchers at Microsoft, features a chatbot that can interact with music services, e-commerce sites, online games and other online resources.\nPaLM-E, created by researchers at Google, uses an \u201cembodied\u201d LLM, trained using sensor data as well as text, to control a robot. It can understand and carry out tasks such as \u201cbring me the rice chips from the drawer\u201d or \u201cpush the red blocks to the coffee cup.\u201d Auto-GPT, created by Toran Bruce Richards of Significant Gravitas, a startup, uses GPT-4 to generate and develop business ideas by knitting together a range of online resources. And so on.\nRead more of our series on ai:\nHow to worry wisely about artificial intelligence\nLarge, creative AI models will transform lives and labour markets\nHow generative models could go wrong\nThe world needs an international agency for artificial intelligence, say two AI experts\n\n\nThe prospect of connecting LLMs to real-world contraptions has \u201cthe safety people freaking out\u201d, Mr Benaich says. But making such systems safer is the focus of much research. One hope is that LLMs will have fewer hallucinations if they are trained on datasets combining text, images and video to provide a richer sense of how the world works. Another approach augments LLMs with formal reasoning capabilities, or with external modules such as task lists and long-term memory.\nObservers agree that building systems around LLMs will drive progress for the next few years. \u201cThe field is very much moving in that direction,\u201d says Oren Etzioni of the Allen Institute for AI. \nBut in academia, researchers are trying to refine and improve LLMs themselves, as well as experimenting with entirely new approaches. Dr Liang\u2019s team recently developed a model called Alpaca, with a view to making it easier for academic researchers to probe the capabilities and limits of LLMs. That is not always easy with models developed by private firms.\nDr Liang notes that today\u2019s LLMs, which are based on the so-called \u201ctransformer\u201d architecture developed by Google, have a limited \u201ccontext window\u201d\u2014akin to short-term memory. Doubling the length of the window increases the computational load fourfold. That limits how fast they can improve. Many researchers are working on post-transformer architectures that can support far bigger context windows\u2014an approach that has been dubbed \u201clong learning\u201d (as opposed to \u201cdeep learning\u201d).\nHello Dave, you\u2019re looking well today\nMeanwhile, other researchers are looking to extend the capabilities of \u201cdiffusion\u201d models. These power generative-AI models, such as Stable Diffusion, that can produce high-quality images from short text prompts (such as \u201cAn Economist cover on banking in the style of Dali\u201d). Images are continuous, whereas text consists of discrete words. But it is possible to apply diffusion to text, says Dr Liang, which might provide another way to improve LLMs. \nAmid the excitement Yann LeCun, one of the leading lights of modern AI, has sounded a sceptical note. In a recent debate at New York University, he argued that LLMs in their current form are \u201cdoomed\u201d and that efforts to control their output, or prevent them making factual errors, will fail. \u201cIt\u2019s not a popular opinion among my colleagues, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fixable,\u201d he said. The field, he fears, has taken the wrong turn; LLMs are \u201can off-ramp\u201d away from the road towards more powerful AI.\nSuch \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d (AGI) is, for some researchers, a kind of holy grail. Some think AGI is within reach, and can be achieved simply by building ever-bigger LLMs; others, like Dr LeCun, disagree. Whether or not they eventually prove a dead end, LLMs have gone much further than anyone might have believed a few years ago, notes Mr Benaich. However you define AGI, AI researchers seem closer to it than they were a couple of years ago. \u25a0\nCurious about the world?
