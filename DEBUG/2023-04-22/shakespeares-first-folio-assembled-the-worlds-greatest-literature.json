By Chris Laoutaris. Pegasus Books; 560 pages; $35. William Collins; \u00a325\nThe Making of Shakespeare\u2019s First Folio. By Emma Smith. Bodleian Library Publishing; 258 pages; $40 and \u00a330\nNot much in European trade runs the same way now as it did four centuries ago. However, English-language publishers still advertise future titles at the Frankfurt Book Fair\u2014just as they did in 1622. In that year, a catalogue of forthcoming English works featured an intriguing volume, announced between blurbs for a biblical commentary and a genealogical tome. It alerted potential buyers to the imminent appearance of \u201cPlays, written by M. William Shakespeare, all in one volume, printed by Isaack Jaggard, in fol[io].\u201d \nThe Frankfurt punters had to wait. That bumper book of playscripts by an author who had died in April 1616 proved a tricky, arduous job. The printers completed it in 1623. By 1624, the chunky compilation was pitched at the fair as \u201cMaster Shakespeare\u2019s Works\u201d. According to Chris Laoutaris, a historian of the volume, this upgrade in terminology implied the \u201cintellectual gravitas\u201d of an author with \u201cgrand achievement\u201d to his name. Among dramatists, only Ben Jonson, Shakespeare\u2019s friend and rival, had presumed to publish a swanky folio of \u201cWorks\u201d before. In 1612 the founder of Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library had even warned against collecting play-texts: worthless \u201cbaggage books\u201d. \nSir Thomas Bodley lost that battle. The so-called First Folio of Shakespeare\u2019s plays soon entered the Bodleian\u2019s collection. This large-format volume, around 950 pages long, not only gathered 36 out of Shakespeare\u2019s 38 surviving plays, it was also the cornerstone of his subsequent renown, which 400 years later extends to parts of the world he never knew existed. Fifty small \u201cquarto\u201d editions of individual Shakespeare plays appeared between 1594 and 1623, and \u201cHenry IV\u201d and \u201cRichard III\u201d proved particularly popular. But 18 Folio items had never seen print before\u2014including \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d, \u201cMacbeth\u201d, \u201cThe Tempest\u201d and \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d. The First Folio fixed the Shakespeare canon for posterity (it lacks only \u201cPericles\u201d and \u201cThe Two Noble Kinsmen\u201d) and even\u2014via Martin Droeshout\u2019s frontispiece of the balding playwright\u2014his physical image. \nReaders can now access a digital reproduction of the Bodleian\u2019s \u201cArch.G c.7\u201d at any time, for nothing: one of several Folios online. If you crave an original copy, the bill will prove steeper. In 2020 Mills College in California sold a high-quality First Folio at Christie\u2019s in New York to a rare-book dealer, Stephan Loewentheil, for $9.98m. Modern celebrity buyers include Sir Paul Getty (who paid \u00a33.5m, or $5.7m, in 2003) and Paul Allen, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder ($6.1m in 2001). In 2021 the University of British Columbia paid $5.9m for a Folio. \nNow, to coincide with the First Folio\u2019s 400th anniversary, Peter Harrington, an antiquarian bookseller in London, is selling a fine copy, previously in private hands, for $7.5m. The firm had the full set of all four 17th-century Folio editions of Shakespeare, plus a scarce edition of his poems from 1640, on offer for $10.5m. Pom Harrington, the proprietor, called that a \u201conce-in-a-generation chance\u201d. The poems, and the Fourth Folio of 1685, have just been sold. (The First remains available.)\nThanks, in part, to his friends\u2019 push to celebrate the playwright\u2019s legacy, Shakespeare\u2019s First Folio is not especially rare compared with other early 17th-century books. From the original print run of around 750 copies, 235 are known to exist. Most, however, lie in hushed, low-lit state in libraries and museums. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, has 82 copies, gems of the literary treasure trove amassed by Henry Folger, the president of Standard Oil, and his wife, Emily. America hosts 149, Britain 50, with the others scattered around the world. Perhaps 27 remain in private hands, and few are likely to enter the open market. \nYour correspondent inspected the First Folio now on sale in London. Inside its handsome calfskin binding\u2014not contemporary, but dating from around 1700\u2014the large pages look, and feel, crisp, clean and strong. Although four of the eight preliminary pages, including poems, dedications and Droeshout\u2019s famous engraving, are marked as facsimiles on this copy, the pages containing the plays\u2019 texts remain intact and unrestored.\nSold in 1950 for \u00a35,000 (then a steep price tag), this Folio had perhaps rested in the library of some proud but not-too-bookish hunting squire in northern England. Its bright and legible leaves of imported French paper showcase the array of crafts that blended to make the volume. Professor Emma Smith of Oxford University, whose study of the Folio\u2019s creation has been revised for the quatercentenary, writes that it was \u201cthe product of many different people with different amounts of agency and investment\u2014personal, intellectual and economic\u2014in the project.\u201d\nProfessor Smith\u2019s book, and Mr Laoutaris\u2019s history of the interlinked careers behind the Folio scheme, bring that network to life. Henry Condell and John Heminge, two of Shakespeare\u2019s actor colleagues from the King\u2019s Men company, co-ordinated the project. Edward Blount, a publisher-bookseller known for his cosmopolitan, upmarket list, led a syndicate that included the father-and-son printers William and Isaac Jaggard, as well as fellow booksellers William Aspley and John Smethwick.\nMr Laoutaris traces the tangled negotiations that led to their acquisition of printing rights for the 22 plays the King\u2019s Men did not control. His resourceful sleuthing ties the Folio\u2019s birth to the politics of its time. Partisans of an Anglo-Spanish alliance\u2014such as Blount and the poets who praised Shakespeare in prefatory verses\u2014were in conflict with a more insular Protestant camp at James I\u2019s court. Hedging their bets, the Folio syndicate dedicated its book to the Earl of Pembroke and his brother: not only backers of the King\u2019s Men, but stalwarts of the anti-Spanish faction.\nThe printing proved a slow, intricate job, with source texts drawn from Shakespeare\u2019s own manuscripts (none of which survives), theatre prompt copies, old quarto editions and cleaned-up \u201cfair copies\u201d recorded by a scribe. The team of around ten compositors included both highly skilled veterans and a notoriously error-prone teenage apprentice, John Leason. Piecemeal corrections with the print run in progress mean that \u201ceach copy is a unique collation\u201d, Professor Smith writes. \nYet the venture, which Mr Laoutaris calls \u201ca bold, gutsy and daring initiative\u201d, paid off. A costly 15 shillings unbound, the Folio nevertheless reached its \u201celite\u201d target audience of buyers willing to treat an anthology of modern plays as a token of \u201cexclusivity, good taste and grandeur\u201d. Soon a \u201cprofitable undertaking\u201d, the Folio did well enough to trigger a revised update in 1632: the Second Folio. \nThe First Folio carried Shakespeare through what Professor Smith dubs his \u201cpost-popular doldrum\u201d: that awkward posthumous patch when art is \u201cneither classic nor current\u201d. Condell, Heminge and colleagues managed to sprinkle the stardust of luxury, glamour and prestige over an assemblage of old plays. In doing so, they ensured that Shakespeare\u2014as Jonson\u2019s dedicatory poem puts it\u2014\u201cwas not of an age, but for all time\u201d. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows,
