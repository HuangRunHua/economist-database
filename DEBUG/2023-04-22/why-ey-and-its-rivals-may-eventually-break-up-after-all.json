Sarah Rapson, deputy head of the FRC, Britain\u2019s audit overseer, worries that the firms no long foster the \u201cculture of scepticism and challenge\u201d that auditing relies on. The problems are on display in a string of much publicised audit snafus. On March 31st APAS, Germany\u2019s accounting watchdog, barred EY\u2019s German branch from taking on new publicly listed audit clients for two years over its failure to spot mischief at Wirecard, a fintech darling turned fraud. Last year KPMG was fined \u00a314m ($18m) by the FRC for feeding misleading information into a review of two of the firm\u2019s audits. In 2020 Deloitte was fined \u00a315m ($19m) by the FRC for audit failings, too.\nThose audit flubs have tarnished the consultants by association. They could also lead to greater pressure from regulators to invest more in auditing, particularly around fraud detection. At the same time, the advisers are getting increasingly capital-hungry\u2014they want to expand into managed services, running functions such as compliance, payroll and cybersecurity on behalf of clients, and they need new technology to do it. An advisory spin-off would leave the auditors flush with cash while freeing the consultants to pump themselves up with fresh equity from outside their partnerships. \nStaying together may no longer be good for attracting talent, either. The increasingly specialist skills offered by the big four leaves fewer opportunities for junior staff to dabble in different tasks. Few bosses want to receive cybersecurity advice from a fresh-faced accountant.\nMr Ucuzoglu of Deloitte warns that auditor-adviser break-ups have \u201cnever once played out as intended\u201d. The consulting business KPMG listed two decades ago, under the name BearingPoint, went bankrupt in 2009. And the sale of EY\u2019s and PwC\u2019s old advisory businesses to, respectively, Capgemini and IBM, two IT-focused consultancies, resulted in messy culture clashes.\nAs EY reels from its graceless tumble down Everest, it and its three rivals will think twice before embarking on a similar expedition. Still, the break-up logic is unlikely to go away. Accenture, a consulting giant, emerged from the rubble of Arthur Andersen, the collapse of which in the early 2000s turned the \u201cbig five\u201d into the big four. It has thrived since, now raking in $62bn a year in sales, more than any of the big four. Since listing in 2001 its market value has risen 20-fold, to $185bn. Such a prize may be too tantalising to resist. \u25a0\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "about":

A big sticking-point was the division of the tax practice, coveted by both auditors and advisers. Plans to publicly list the advisory business and load it with debt to pay off audit partners also looked cleverer when the deal was conceived in 2021, amid low interest rates and frothy share prices.\nThis suspension is a huge blow to EY\u2019s global bosses, who underestimated just what an uphill climb \u201cProject Everest\u201d, the unfortunately codenamed break-up project, would prove. To EY\u2019s split-averse professional-services rivals in the so-called \u201cbig four\u201d, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC, it looks like vindication. Joe Ucuzoglu, Deloitte\u2019s global chief, insists the \u201cmultidisciplinary model\u201d is the \u201cfoundation\u201d of his firm\u2019s success. Bill Thomas, his opposite number at KPMG, says his firm\u2019s decision in the early 2000s to list its advisory arm (since regrown) was \u201cnot the right thing\u201d.  Bob Moritz, who leads PwC, insists keeping the businesses together is central to his firm\u2019s ability to recruit and retain talent. \nYet the case against turning the big four into a biggish eight is far from open and shut. That is because the commercial logic of the split is getting more compelling. At stake is the future of one of the business world\u2019s most critical oligopolies.\n\nThe big four are the heavyweight champions of professional services. They dominate the market for audits\u2014checking the books for 493 of the companies in America\u2019s S&P 500 index and a big proportion of European blue chips. They also offer clients a one-stop shop for advice on issues from dealmaking to digitisation. Together, as of last year, they employed 1.4m people and generated $190bn in fees, up from $134bn in 2017 (see chart 1). KPMG, the smallest of the big four, generates three times the revenue of McKinsey, the high priest of strategy consulting.\nThe driving force behind the big four\u2019s growth in recent years has been the rapid expansion of their advisory businesses, which now account for half their combined revenues (see chart 2). In the early 2000s EY, KPMG and PwC all spun off or sold their consulting arms in response to new conflict-of-interest regulations, which barred them from selling advice to audit clients. (Deloitte planned but then abandoned a spin-off.) With little room to expand in audits, however, the giants were soon lured back into the fast-growing business of advice.\nThe rebundling has in many ways paid off. The opportunity to dabble in different service lines has helped the big four entice the bright-eyed young things their businesses rely on. A career in bean-counting looks more appealing when it comes with the opportunity to work on big acquisitions or advise governments on important matters, observes Laura Empson of Bayes Business School in London and formerly of the board of KPMG\u2019s British branch.\nThe big four\u2019s breadth has helped them win over clients, too. Expertise in areas such as tax and valuations has  helped KPMG and the others solidify their position as auditors-of-choice for large companies, says Mr Thomas. Widely recognised audit brands, meanwhile, have boosted the reputation of the firms\u2019 advisory arms.\nMr Moritz argues that the multidisciplinary model has also helped PwC and the other professional-services giants adapt to the digital era. Software and data now underpin nearly all the services the firms offer. The auditors benefit from the technological know-how of the advisers, while the advisers benefit from the steady demand for audit work, which can fund investments even during downturns.\nAll that explains why some have balked at the idea of a separation. Firms operate franchise-like structures, with independent partnerships in each country, which also makes big shifts like a break up tough to pull off\u2014as EY discovered in America.\nYet the case for staying conjoined is weakening as the big four\u2019s businesses shift towards consulting. Auditor-independence rules have turned from an inconvenience into a drag; a bugbear of EY\u2019s is its inability to team up with the software firms it audits, such as Salesforce, to help them roll out their technology to clients. Newish requirements in Europe and elsewhere for firms to rotate their auditors, typically every ten years, have increased clashes between audit and advisory partners over who will serve big customers. \nMeanwhile, auditing has been steadily losing its internal clout, says Ms Empson. Sarah Rapson, deputy head of the FRC, Britain\u2019s audit overseer, worries that the firms no long foster the \u201cculture of scepticism and challenge\u201d that auditing relies on. The problems are on display in a string of much publicised audit snafus. On March 31st APAS, Germany\u2019s accounting watchdog, barred EY\u2019s German branch from taking on new publicly listed audit clients for two years over its failure to spot mischief at Wirecard, a fintech darling turned fraud. Last year KPMG was fined \u00a314m ($18m) by the FRC for feeding misleading information into a review of two of the firm\u2019s audits. In 2020 Deloitte was fined \u00a315m ($19m) by the FRC for audit failings, too.\nThose audit flubs have tarnished the consultants by association. They could also lead to greater pressure from regulators to invest more in auditing, particularly around fraud detection. At the same time, the advisers are getting increasingly capital-hungry\u2014they want to expand into managed services, running functions such as compliance, payroll and cybersecurity on behalf of clients, and they need new technology to do it. An advisory spin-off would leave the auditors flush with cash while freeing the consultants to pump themselves up with fresh equity from outside their partnerships. \nStaying together may no longer be good for attracting talent, either. The increasingly specialist skills offered by the big four leaves fewer opportunities for junior staff to dabble in different tasks. Few bosses want to receive cybersecurity advice from a fresh-faced accountant.\nMr Ucuzoglu of Deloitte warns that auditor-adviser break-ups have \u201cnever once played out as intended\u201d. The consulting business KPMG listed two decades ago, under the name BearingPoint, went bankrupt in 2009. And the sale of EY\u2019s and PwC\u2019s old advisory businesses to, respectively, Capgemini and IBM, two IT-focused consultancies, resulted in messy culture clashes.\nAs EY reels from its graceless tumble down Everest, it and its three rivals will think twice before embarking on a similar expedition. Still, the break-up logic is unlikely to go away. Accenture, a consulting giant, emerged from the rubble of Arthur Andersen, the collapse of which in the early 2000s turned the \u201cbig five\u201d into the big four. It has thrived since, now raking in $62bn a year in sales, more than any of the big four. Since listing in 2001 its market value has risen 20-fold, to $185bn. Such a prize may be too tantalising to resist. \u25a0\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",
