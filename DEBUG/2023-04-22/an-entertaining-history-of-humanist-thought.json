"https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/04/19/an-entertaining-history-of-humanist-thought", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Humanly Possible. By Sarah Bakewell. Penguin Press; 464 pages; $30. Chatto & Windus; \u00a322\nNear the start of her account of humanism, Sarah Bakewell draws an important distinction. Anti-humanists, she writes, despise the material world and seek either to escape it using religion or remake it by means of totalitarian politics. Humanists, by contrast, are cautious optimists who embrace the possibility that common endeavour can unite people and improve their lot. \nMs Bakewell pledges her allegiance to the humanists, yet she also acknowledges that anti-humanism has its place as an antidote to naivety and complacency. \u201cIt forces humanism to keep working to justify itself,\u201d she writes. As anti-humanist forces muster today, in authoritarian states and among right- and left-wing populists in democracies, this book is Ms Bakewell\u2019s justification.\nAptly, the early chapters are themselves an exercise in the Renaissance humanist tradition of digging up forgotten texts. Petrarch will be familiar; less so Leontius Pilatus, a shaggy-bearded Calabrian, or Poggio Bracciolini, who wrote what Ms Bakewell describes as the first published joke book. As she romps through the centuries, readers will feel assured that they are in the company of a gifted guide.\nMs Bakewell also has a serious point to make. In 1440 Lorenzo Valla, a priest and scholar (pictured above), demolished the church\u2019s claim to have dominion over western Europe. Valla drew on history and textual analysis to show that the document in which the Emperor Constantine supposedly surrendered the territory to the Vatican was a fake. Many others were to follow Valla, deploying reason to spread the spirit of Enlightenment.\nOver the centuries, humanism also found a voice in science. Ms Bakewell could have focused on the discoveries of Nicolaus Copernicus or Galileo Galilei; instead, somewhat arbitrarily, she identifies scientific humanism with Charles Darwin. The theory of evolution from natural selection wrecked the biblical account of creation and established the continuity between humanity and the rest of the living world. Her narrative explores how generations of educated Anglican curates struggled to reconcile Darwin\u2019s ideas with their own religious beliefs\u2014and how, as the poet Matthew Arnold was to write in \u201cDover Beach\u201d, the \u201cSea of Faith\u201d receded.\nAny account of humanism in the 20th century must grapple with its failure to prevent the rise of fascism and communism. Some humanists, such as Stefan Zweig, thought that belief systems built around violence and power would self-destruct. Yet he eventually concluded that faith in the goodness of mankind was a \u201cbeautiful error\u201d.\nAlas, humanists themselves also share the blame. The German author Thomas Mann, living in exile, said that \u201cin all humanism there is an element of weakness, which\u2026may be its ruin.\u201d It did not help that, with honourable exceptions, many humanists had been blind to the claims of all those who were not fortunate enough to be white, European and male. \nHaving alerted readers to today\u2019s populists and dictators, you might think that Ms Bakewell would use the conclusion of her book to explore the threat from contemporary anti-humanism. Instead, she is distracted by modern humanist organisations and their designs, such as the launch of an advertising campaign under the slogan: \u201cThere\u2019s probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.\u201d \nIn that spirit, Ms Bakewell closes with a quotation from her favourite humanist, Robert G. Ingersoll, a 19th-century American lawyer and orator: \u201cHappiness is the only good. The time to be happy is now. The place to be happy is here. The way to be happy is to make others so.\u201d That is indeed one foundation for a good life. But you feel that, faced with threats to the humanist worldview from the likes of the Chinese Communist Party, Vladimir Putin and the forces polarising democratic politics, today\u2019s humanists are ducking the lessons of history. \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter", "description": "Sarah
