"\u201cCorruption is our biggest enemy and is not welcome here.\u201d So goes the slogan of Malawi\u2019s most recent anti-graft campaign. Similar messages can be found in public places in many other African countries. In some, such as South Africa and Kenya, citizens are encouraged to call hotlines to report kickbacks. \nIn most African countries citizens tell pollsters that graft is getting worse. High-profile scandals among bigwigs are one reason for that, though it may also be that dodgy deals are being uncovered more often, rather than becoming more common. For most people, though, it is because they still face regular shakedowns from officials and the police. Fully one in four Africans who used public services or interacted with police told pollsters they had paid a bribe in the previous year, according to a report in 2019 by Transparency International, a Berlin-based NGO. Still, widespread anti-corruption efforts do at least pose awkward questions to the determinedly unscrupulous. For example, how do you best ask for a bribe when you are sitting under an anti-corruption poster? \nSome still trust in impunity. \u201cGive me something,\u201d demands a woman X-raying bags at Enugu airport in Nigeria, conceding impressively little to anti-graft efforts. Others make small concessions to subtlety. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d asks an immigration officer in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital. \nOthers seem to have grown wary of making blunt demands amid the campaigns against graft. One approach is to talk about something other than money. Some officials, for example, like to keep citizens well abreast of their food and drink preferences. \u201cI really want to drink a Nescafe,\u201d declares an airport security guard six times as he frisks your correspondent in Burkina Faso. In Uganda traffic police find ways to mention their favourite soda. In South Africa such requests are so common that bribes for driving offences are known as \u201ccold drink money\u201d. \nThose wishing for a little more deniability like to imply the drink might not be for them. In Kenya police sometimes ask for chai ya wazee (\u201ctea for the elders\u201d). In Nigeria police officers might suggest that they are simply trying to do their job by saying they need fuel for their patrol vehicle. All still expect cash. \nSkilled exponents of extortion often approach their targets with an amiable air. \u201cAre you my friend?\u201d asks a smiling traffic cop in Nigeria. Having elicited a solicitous \u201cYes, sir\u201d, he swiftly delivers his demand for a bung. Others mix a measure of concern with a pinch of menace. \u201cWe are here for you,\u201d says a policeman to a motorist, even as he prevents him from moving on. \nReligion can be surprisingly useful to those looking to subtly request a sweetener. Some might invoke Christian charity with an innocent-sounding inquiry: \u201cAnything for Sunday?\u201d Others cloak their extortion as a request to \u201dbless the table.\u201d \nForeigners can sometimes feign ignorance by, for instance, taking the request for a drink literally by handing over a bottle or promising to return with a can when next passing that way. Those who come from rich countries are seldom pressed too hard, since arresting or roughing them up would lead to consular protests. Many locals, alas, have no such privilege. \u25a0", "description": "In southern Africa try invoking thirst; in west Africa, religion", "ogDescription": "In southern Africa try invoking thirst; in west
