"War broke out in Sudan between the national army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan\u2019s de facto leader, who seized power in a coup in 2021, and the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary commanded by Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo. Some 300 people, most of them civilians, were killed and at least 2,600 injured in the first few days of fighting, which has seen tanks and air strikes in Khartoum, the capital. Hospitals and aid agencies have been looted and diplomats attacked. \nBurkina Faso\u2019s military government declared a general mobilisation (claiming the power to requisition people, goods and services and to impose a state of emergency) to fight jihadists who control around half the country. Western military sources worry that jihadists moving south may be able to encircle Ouagadougou, the capital, having already cut off road links in the north.\nRachid Ghannouchi, the long-serving leader of Ennahda, Tunisia\u2019s main Islamist party, was arrested, according to the party. This marks a drastic step against the opposition by Kais Saied, the increasingly repressive president. \nIn a sign that the two sides in Yemen\u2019s civil war may be getting closer to a peace deal, almost 900 people were released in a prisoner swap between the Houthis, a Shia rebel group that controls large parts of the country, and the Saudi-led coalition that has been fighting them since 2015. Meanwhile at least 80 people died in a crush as aid was being distributed in Sana\u2019a, the capital. \nSergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, visited Brazil and Venezuela. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s president, met Mr Lavrov, after stirring up trouble by suggesting that America was prolonging the fighting in Ukraine by sending weapons to Kiev. Lula clarified later that he condemned the invasion of Ukraine, but American officials remained unimpressed. Mr Lavrov is also visiting Cuba and Nicaragua. \nMexico\u2019s Supreme Court annulled a contentious reform backed by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the president, which would have put the National Guard, ostensibly a civilian police force, under the control of the armed forces. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador meanwhile accused the Pentagon of spying on Mexico, and promised to safeguard classified information about the army. \n\nA Russian court sentenced a prominent critic of the Putin regime to 25 years in prison for criticising the war in Ukraine, which the prosecution considered to be tantamount to treason. Vladimir Kara- Murza, who holds dual British-Russian citizenship, told the court he stood by \u201cevery word\u201d and did not want to be acquitted. The judge took just minutes to rule on the case. \nA separate Russian court upheld the detention of Evan Gershkovich, a journalist with the Wall Street Journal, on allegations of spying and refused to grant him bail. The American government again called for his  release. \nPoland, Hungary and Slovakia banned some Ukrainian food imports. The governments in all three countries are under pressure from farmers, who claim that cheaper Ukrainian surpluses undercut their bottom line. Officials in the EU said the bans were possibly illegal and counter-productive, undermining Europe\u2019s support for Ukraine. One diplomat accused the Polish government of engaging in \u201cgesture politics\u201d. The government said it would allow Ukrainian grain to transit through Poland. \nCarry on, Emmanuel\nEmmanuel Macron tried to regain control of the political agenda in France after months of sometimes violent protests against his pension reforms. He promised new measures to improve working conditions, among other things, by July 14th, Bastille Day. The French president said now was a time for \u201cunity\u201d. His comments came shortly after he signed the reform, which increases the state retirement age from 62 to 64, into law. \nThe disarray within the Scottish National Party following the abrupt departure of Nicola Sturgeon as leader continued with the arrest of the party\u2019s treasurer, who then stepped back from the role. The police are investigating claims that donations for a second independence referendum were misused. The scrutiny is an embarrassment for the SNP as it attempts a reset under its new leader, Humza Yousaf. He has said he only recently learnt that the party has been without auditors since October.\nA 24-year-old man threw a smoke bomb at Japan\u2019s prime minister, Kishida Fumio. The bomb-thrower was reportedly aggrieved at having been barred from running for an election.
