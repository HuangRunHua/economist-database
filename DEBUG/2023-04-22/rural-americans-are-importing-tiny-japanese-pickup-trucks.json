Rural Americans are importing tiny Japanese pickup trucks", "headline": "Rural Americans are importing tiny Japanese pickup trucks", "section": "United States", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/20/rural-americans-are-importing-tiny-japanese-pickup-trucks", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "A couple of years ago Jake Morgan, a farmer who lives just outside Raleigh, in North Carolina, realised he needed a new vehicle to get around his property. At first he was looking at \u201cside-by-sides\u201d\u2014a sort of off-road utility vehicle. But watching a review on YouTube of one that costs around $30,000 made by John Deere, he saw a comment that said something like \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get a minitruck instead?\u201d That is, a tiny four-wheel drive pickup truck, sometimes known as a \u201cKei\u201d truck, mostly made in Japan to take advantage of laws there which tax smaller vehicles less.\nIntrigued, Mr Morgan started researching. Within a few months, he drove to Newport, Virginia to pick up a 1997 Honda Acty, having spent a total of just $2,000 on importing it. He was delighted. Not only was it \u201cdirt cheap\u201d, but the Acty is less than five feet wide, and so can get into tight spaces a normal pickup cannot, like Mr Morgan\u2019s barn. And unlike a side-by-side, it can also be driven legally on local roads. \u201cThey\u2019re amazingly useful,\u201d he says. Not long after importing his first, he sold it and bought another. The new one is even better\u2014it has air-conditioning and a button which activates a dumper.\nKei trucks were never intended for sale in America. Most are right-hand drive, and they do not always have airbags or other safety features required in new cars. The bulk are imported under a rule that allows non-compliant vehicles that are older than 25 years to be brought into America, a carve-out intended originally for collectible vintage cars, although a few specialist dealers import newer ones too, for sale as off-road vehicles. They fill a niche American manufacturers are failing to.\nTodd Gatto, one of the owners of hvny Imports, a firm in Goshen, New York, says that he has sold over 300 to local businesses in the past few years. \u201cWe bought five of them to start, and we sold them all within seven days,\u201d he says. Buyers include farmers, but also building contractors, a deli and Legoland, the theme park. \u201cA lot of commercial businesses see the use of these over an $85,000 F250,\u201d he says (the F250 is an enormous pickup truck sold by Ford). \nUnlike new vehicles with onboard computers and complicated proprietary parts, Kei trucks are easy to modify and repair. In northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, people fit them out with tracks to drive on ice in winter. Some owners are almost cultish. \u201cMotoCheez\u201d, a mechanic from Connecticut, says his YouTube channel\u2019s popularity soared after he started featuring his Kei truck.\nAs the demand grows, some worry that the loopholes that allow their import and use might be closed. Dealers increasingly report trouble getting the vehicles registered for road use, particularly in north-eastern states. Safety concerns are part of the reason. Mr Morgan admits his would be a \u201cdeath trap\u201d on a busy highway. But some fans suspect an auto-industry stitch-up to keep out cheap Japanese competition. If so, it would not be the first time.\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues
