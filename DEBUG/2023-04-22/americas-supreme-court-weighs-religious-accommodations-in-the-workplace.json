pinch-hitting mail carrier for the United States Postal Service in 2012, his strict observance of the Christian sabbath posed no problem. But after the USPS started doing business with Amazon a year later\u2014delivering the internet giant\u2019s packages every day of the week\u2014those Sabbatarian commitments became an issue. Mr Groff\u2019s rural-Pennsylvania bosses found ways to accommodate him for a time, but colleagues grew weary of taking his shifts and he was instructed to report on Sundays. Mr Groff refused, drawing letters of reprimand and suspensions. Eventually, in 2019, he quit.\nMr Groff lost twice in lower courts when he claimed USPS had violated the bar on religion-based discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On April 18th, when Groff v DeJoy came to the Supreme Court, justices from right to left\u2014and lawyers for both parties\u2014found some common ground. All agreed the court was mistaken in 1977 when it wrote, in Trans World Airlines v Hardison, that companies need not \u201cbear more than a de minimis cost\u201d when offering religious accommodations. This formulation, to everyone\u2019s mind, failed to uphold Title VII\u2019s promise that businesses must accommodate such religious requests unless they inflict an \u201cundue hardship on the conduct of the employer\u2019s business\u201d.\nTrying to save Hardison from its universally disdained de minimis test, Justice Brett Kavanaugh pointed to a footnote in the decision clarifying that only a showing of \u201csubstantial\u201d costs could relieve an employer of the duty to make room for an employee\u2019s religious practice. Justice Neil Gorsuch built on this in colloquy with Elizabeth Prelogar, the solicitor-general, who defended the postal service. Both parties agree that whether a business must offer an accommodation is \u201ccontext-dependent\u201d, he said, and that civil-rights protections must be robust, not \u201ctrifling\u201d. And, Justice Gorsuch suggested, there may not be much daylight between \u201csignificant difficulty or expense\u201d (Mr Groff\u2019s proposed standard) and \u201csubstantial cost\u201d (Hardison\u2019s). So why, Justice Gorsuch asked, shouldn\u2019t the Supreme Court just clarify that, send the case back to the lower court and therefore \u201cbe done with it\u201d?\nJustice Elena Kagan threw some chilly water on this ostensible solution. All the \u201ckumbaya-ing\u201d in the abstract is lovely, she said, but the parties still disagree about whether Mr Groff had a right to take every Sunday off\u2014and, more broadly, there is currently a big difference of opinion between the parties \u201cas to which cases require an accommodation\u201d. \nMs Prelogar argued that Title VII does not require a company to provide an accommodation that would leave it persistently short-staffed or paying overtime week after week. Three of Mr Groff\u2019s co-workers were bothered enough by having to fill in for him on Sundays that one quit, one transferred and one filed a grievance. This, Ms Prelogar said, counts as \u201can undue hardship under any reasonable standard\u201d. Mr Groff\u2019s lawyer, Aaron Streett, said this approach \u201cwould have the effect of eviscerating\u2026any Sabbatarian observance\u201d that \u201cwas at the very core\u201d of what Congress was trying to protect when it passed Title VII.\nMicah Schwartzman, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said before the oral argument that most observers had been expecting the court to overrule Hardison. But the tenor of the hearing puts that prediction on shakier ground. The three more liberal justices\u2014Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor\u2014may have at least two conservatives on their side in hanging on to the nearly five-decade-old precedent.\nJustices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh seem more keen to clarify than to abandon the Hardison precedent, and Donald Trump\u2019s third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, also pointed towards a more modest resolution. Justice Kagan said she could count on \u201clike, a finger\u201d how many times the court has overturned similar statutory precedents that Congress could fix by itself.\nJustice Samuel Alito took a sharper position, telling Ms Prelogar he was \u201creally struck\u201d by her claim that the courts have been enforcing Title VII faithfully. Friend-of-the-court briefs from \u201cMuslims, Hindus, Orthodox Jews [and] Seventh Day Adventists\u201d, he said, claim that Hardison has harmed their religious freedom. \u201cAre they wrong?\u201d Yes, Ms Prelogar said. The record shows a \u201csubstantial zone of protection for religious exercise\u201d over decades of litigation in American courts.\nWith the exception of Justice Alito and perhaps Justice Clarence Thomas, who said little, the court seemed receptive to Ms Prelogar\u2019s plea not to rock the boat by coming up with a new standard. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear to me, after all this discussion,\u201d said Justice Sotomayor late in the hearing, is that although some \u201cmight want to provide absolute clarity, there is none we can give, is there?\u201d Justice Kavanaugh sounded resigned, too; \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d, he said, \u201cwe can give you a full manual about how it is going to play out.\u201d\u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly
