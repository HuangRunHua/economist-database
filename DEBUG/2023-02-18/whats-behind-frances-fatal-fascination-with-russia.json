In the 1760s and 1770s the French Enlightenment thinker and the Russian empress exchanged 197 handwritten missives, all in French, a tongue favoured by the Russian nobility. Voltaire praised Catherine as an \u201cenlightened despot\u201d, and told her: \u201cIf I were younger, I would become Russian.\u201d In 1773 she received Denis Diderot, another silk-stockinged philosophe, at the Court of St Petersburg. Thus Russia took its place in the French imagination as a like-minded haven of arts and letters, of the triumph of civilisation over chaos.\nIf Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine exposed Germany\u2019s industrial reliance on Moscow, it has laid bare in France a different sort of dependence: a fatal fascination with Russia. On the far left, this is a relic of the Bolshevik revolution, anti-Americanism and communism. During the cold war, the French Communist Party looked to Moscow, and dropped the hammer and sickle from its membership card only in 2013. On the far right, it stems from admiration for patriotic nationalism and authoritarian leadership. Marine Le Pen\u2019s campaigns have been partly financed by a Russian bank.\nRussia\u2019s hold on the French imagination is not confined to the extremes. It reaches well into the parquet-floored salons of the Paris establishment. As a young man, Jacques Chirac, a former Gaullist president who sought a multipolar world to counterbalance American hegemony, translated Pushkin\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin\u201d into French. Chirac was given Russia\u2019s highest honour, and in turn awarded Vladimir Putin the l\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur. Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a prime minister from the centre-right, was a regular guest of Mr Putin\u2019s. The day after the tanks rolled in, Mr Fillon gave up board positions at two Russian firms, having apparently seen the invasion of Crimea in 2014 as no obstacle to accepting the posts. \nThose who gravitated to this world comforted themselves with the thought that France\u2019s tropisme russe was neither dangerous nor grubby, but the fruit of a special cultural understanding. For nearly a decade from 2008 Alexandre Orlov, then Russia\u2019s ambassador to Paris, entertained the Paris elite, and oversaw the construction of a glittering gold-tipped Russian Orthodox cathedral on the left bank of the Seine. When Mr Orlov published his memoirs in 2020, the preface was written by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Carr\u00e8re d\u2019Encausse, the \u201cperpetual secretary\u201d of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. His book, she suggested, would help readers to understand \u201cthe disarray\u201d of Soviet Russians at the collapse of their country. \nOf course, in the arena of France\u2019s riotous political debate, as within the hushed corridors of the diplomatic service, rival geopolitical strains compete. A reflexive sympathy for Russia is neither universal nor irresistible. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a Socialist former president, cancelled a French contract to deliver two Mistral-class warships to Russia after it annexed Crimea. Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, a French philosopher for whom no battlefield goes unvisited and no white shirt unironed, has for years urged France to do more to stand up to Russian aggression in Ukraine; his latest film to this end, \u201cSlava Ukraini\u201d, is out on February 22nd. \nEven France\u2019s post-war narrative of strategic equidistance between America and the Soviet Union has its share of mythology. As Benjamin Haddad, one of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s parliamentarians, puts it, \u201cgeopolitical fascination for Russia is partly reconstructed with hindsight\u201d: in a crisis, Charles de Gaulle stood with his transatlantic allies. As for the French people, they seem clear: three-fifths tell polls they have a positive opinion of Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky, and fewer than one in ten of Mr Putin. \nThis is the backdrop against which France\u2019s diplomacy under Mr Macron should be set. It was to Versailles, where Peter the Great had travelled, that the freshly elected Mr Macron first invited Mr Putin with great pomp, lauding \u201cthe Russia that wants to open up to Europe\u201d. More than any other European leader, the centrist French president thought that he could talk Mr Putin out of going to war, even as he massed his tanks on Ukraine\u2019s borders and America\u2019s spooks were warning that invasion was imminent. Almost alone, Mr Macron mused about a day when Russia might be brought into a \u201cnew European security architecture\u201d, to keep it from falling into China\u2019s arms. The invasion, the massacres, the bombing of civilians and children: all the unspeakable horrors of Mr Putin\u2019s war have, over time, forced a form of bereavement on the French leader. His charm offensive failed, brutally. \nThe shadow of Versailles\nThis is a critical moment for Mr Macron. He continues to listen both to voices counselling traditional caution and restraint, and to those urging him to take more leadership on Ukraine and to dispel illusions about a future Russia. His quest to embrace the complexity of war and peace will doubtless yield further ambiguity. The French president has not spoken to Mr Putin since September 2022, but says the lines are still open. Only two months ago he was muttering about post-war \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d for Russia. Mr Macron wants both to back Ukraine at war, and to be a mediating voice at the negotiating table when it comes to peace. \nYet in recent weeks he has seldom sounded as clear, declaring that France is behind Ukraine \u201call the way to victory\u201d and delivering more and more heavy weaponry\u2014though not yet promising battle tanks, unlike many of his allies. \u201cI think he has changed, and this time for real,\u201d said none other than Mr Zelensky in Le Figaro newspaper on February 8th, the day he flew into Paris from London for dinner. When the next morning the two leaders boarded the French presidential plane bound for Brussels, who should be there at the airport for a chat but the white-shirted Mr L\u00e9vy. Mr Macron\u2019s ears are open. But ultimately, on diplomacy as on all matters, he is his own counsellor. It might be too much to expect the French president to shed his share of the country\u2019s Russian fascination altogether; but he is moving in the right direction. \u25a0\nRead more from Charlemagne,
