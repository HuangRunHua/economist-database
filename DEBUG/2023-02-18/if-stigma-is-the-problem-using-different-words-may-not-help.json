But the wire service recently tweeted: \u201cWe recommend avoiding general and often dehumanising \u2018the\u2019 labels such as the poor, the mentally ill, the French, the disabled, the college-educated.\u201d After the tweet went viral, the AP deleted it and apologised for dehumanising \u201cthe French\u201d. \nDespite the mockery, the AP advice has solid reasoning behind it: that of \u201cpeople-centred\u201d language. English (like many other languages) allows the use of an adjective as a noun: the good, the bad, the ugly. But in contrast to some other languages, it is increasingly considered essentialising to refer to \u201cthe poor\u201d or \u201cthe disabled\u201d, as though they are nothing else. This especially applies to characteristics that might be considered unfortunate. The AP did not apologise to \u201cthe college-educated\u201d as it did to the French, but it did not need to; nobody really minds being lumped in either group. The issue is essentialising combined with stigma.\nSome people are also troubled by bare group nouns such as \u201cblacks\u201d, \u201cgays\u201d and \u201cJews\u201d, though these too seem to be on the decline. Fortunately, it is not hard to add another word without clunking up your prose\u2014either \u201cpeople\u201d or, even better, something descriptive as in \u201cblack veterans\u201d, \u201cgay activists\u201d or \u201cJewish voters\u201d. These make these phrases a bit more three-dimensional, like the people they point to.\nThese are far from the only ideas flowing into journalists\u2019 inboxes today. Suggestions abound: replace \u201cslaves\u201d with \u201censlaved people\u201d; \u201cminorities\u201d with \u201cminoritised people\u201d or \u201cracialised people\u201d; \u201caddicts\u201d with \u201cdrug users\u201d or \u201cpeople with a substance-abuse problem\u201d; \u201cobese people\u201d with \u201cpeople with obesity\u201d; \u201cconvicts\u201d or \u201cinmates\u201d with \u201cthose who are incarcerated\u201d. And so on.\nIn each instance, the target is a term that is, or can be seen as, pejorative. The alternative is meant to be less so. But those who encourage these lexical replacements face several problems.\nOne is that though a case can be made for each individual change, adopting every one will quickly make a piece of writing lumbering, since every new option is longer than the one it is supposed to replace. It will also make prose seem more unnatural, since the entire point is to replace words in common use with phrases that are not. Good journalism is ideally conversational and accessible, calling for a brisk and compelling style.\nChanging the world is hard; changing the language is a lot easier, which is why linguistic engineering can tempt people who may feel they have no other tools at hand apart from their keyboards. But it does not seem to work out as hoped. Replacing a stigmatised word often merely results in the stigma attaching to the new word. \u201cRetarded\u201d was once a polite way of saying \u201cfeeble-minded\u201d; it was in long-standing clinical use before becoming a playground insult and, ultimately, deeply offensive. \u201cSpecial needs\u201d came next, but now \u201cspecial\u201d is a mean-spirited taunt too. \nIn the same vein \u201chandicapped\u201d was a kinder replacement for \u201ccrippled\u201d, and \u201chomeless\u201d for \u201cvagrant\u201d. Now \u201chandicapped\u201d is out and \u201cdisabled\u201d is in (or, better yet, \u201cperson with a disability\u201d). \u201cUnhoused\u201d is gaining ground over \u201chomeless\u201d. This \u201ceuphemism treadmill\u201d has been observed since at least the 1970s. Nevertheless, people still hope to remake the world through language. \nSome groups have taken another tack, and reclaimed older terms. \u201cAfrican-American\u201d had a 30-year heyday, but now \u201cblack\u201d is back, and even given a capital B by many. Though \u201chearing-impaired\u201d is still in medical parlance, many \u201cDeaf\u201d people proudly refer to themselves as such, also with a capital D. Other activists have decided there is nothing wrong with being \u201cfat\u201d, and have wholeheartedly embraced the term. As with reclaiming slurs, the idea seems to be that showing pride is likely to be more effective than swapping words.\nAs for writers, good work should humanise whatever it is about, which is why stories often begin with a named person before going into causation and abstraction. If such writing is sharply as well as humanely done, it will be compelling to readers, and may even be of benefit to its subjects. To that end, the language of everyday conversation is likely to be at least as useful as the latest terminology recommended by activists. People-centred writing is indeed a good thing\u2014but there is more than one way of putting people at its heart. \u25a0\nRead more from Johnson, our columnist on language:\nSome well-known
