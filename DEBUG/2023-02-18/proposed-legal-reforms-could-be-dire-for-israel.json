Mr Rothman is in charge of pushing through a radical overhaul of the country\u2019s judicial system. On February 13th the committee voted in favour of the first tranche of the changes as nearly 100,000 Israelis demonstrated outside the Knesset. \nThe leaders of those protests cite the same prophecy. And both sides claim the same goal: saving Israel\u2019s democracy. Since Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s latest government took power in December 2022, Israel has been engulfed by a toxic row over the powers of the fiercely independent Supreme Court. Supporters of the reforms argue that, after decades of a \u201cjudicial dictatorship\u201d that has imposed its own left-wing values, they would restore democracy. Opponents say they threaten Israel\u2019s democratic nature and risk introducing majoritarian rule. But it is increasingly clear that the conflict is about  more than the role of the country\u2019s judges. The two sides are fighting over different visions of Israel.\nThe government is right to point to flaws in the country\u2019s judicial system. The balance of power between the court and parliament is unclear. Israel has no formal constitution. In that vacuum the court has become ever more activist. In the 1990s it deemed a series of \u201cbasic laws\u201d passed by the Knesset, which establish rights, to be quasi-constitutional in weight. It has since dismissed various pieces of legislation on the basis of narrow and controversial interpretations of those laws. \nBut the government\u2019s agenda goes beyond a redress of power. Under its plans, the Knesset would in nearly all cases be able to override Supreme Court rulings. The court would no longer be able to nullify government decisions on the basis of \u201creasonableness\u201d. The government could stack the judicial appointments committee with government representatives. \nIf they pass, the reforms would remove nearly all checks and balances on the government. Israel not only lacks a constitution, but also an upper house to review legislation. The government of the day controls parliament. Members of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition are already introducing a raft of controversial proposals that include disqualifying \u201cterror-supporting\u201d Israeli Arabs from running in elections and allowing politicians with criminal records to serve as ministers.\nLegal experts say the changes could make Israeli leaders and military commanders more vulnerable to charges of war crimes in international courts because it would be harder to argue that they are subject to an independent judiciary at home. The government\u2019s opponents, who include business leaders and former generals and intelligence chiefs, object to both the content and process of the reforms. They are being rushed through in a series of raucous committee meetings, where the objections of the opposition and legal experts have been dismissed. \n\u201cDemocratic countries like ours can become dictatorships,\u201d warned Ron Huldai, the mayor of Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s secular and liberal bastion. \u201cBut dictatorships can only return to be democracies through bloodshed.\u201d Such dire predictions are increasingly common. On February 12th Isaac Herzog, Israel\u2019s president, said that the country was \u201con the brink of constitutional and social collapse\u201d. He called on the politicians to discuss a watered-down version of the plans. The government refuses. Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition and a former prime minister, is willing to discuss legal reform but insists a presidential committee should come up with a constitutional proposal to put to the Israeli people.\nMr Netanyahu\u2019s personal legal issues make reaching a consensus harder. The prime minister was once a staunch defender of the Supreme Court\u2019s independence but, facing charges for bribery and fraud (which he strenuously denies), he has become a fierce critic.  And if the court were to recuse Mr Netanyahu, Israel could face a constitutional crisis. \nAnxiety about the reforms is spreading. Israel\u2019s business community, which has rarely intervened in politics, has criticised the proposals. Workers from the tech sector, which accounts for more than half of Israel\u2019s exports of goods and services, have joined the protests and senior executives have threatened to move their money abroad. \u201cIsrael built a prosperous economy in part due to its strong institutions and clear ground-rules,\u201d explains Karnit Flug, a former governor of Israel\u2019s central bank. Making rapid and radical changes would jeopardise that, she argues.\nThe rancorous debate is forcing Israelis to grapple with the demographic and ideological changes that have brought their country\u2019s most religious and nationalist government to power. It is pitting supporters of the far-right parties most opposed to the Supreme Court, who are much less likely to serve in the army or work in tech companies, against the secular middle class, who have rallied around the court.  \nIsrael\u2019s internal convulsions might seem less relevant to its relations with the rest of the Middle East, hardly a hotbed of liberalism. But Mr Netanyahu returned to office promising to establish formal relations with Saudi Arabia. His government\u2019s turbulent start may make that harder. \nThe kingdom does not much care about the state of Israeli democracy: it is not a democracy either. But the Saudis do care about their own self-interest. Shared hostility towards Iran has brought them closer to Israel over the past decade. For the Saudis to make the relationship official, however, they need something more. America brokered the Abraham accords, which saw four Arab states upgrade their ties with Israel in 2020. It would probably need to fill the same role in a Saudi-Israeli deal. Normalisation is a powerful card in Washington: if the Saudis play it, they will expect a big boost to their diplomatic standing.\nJoe Biden has spent most of his presidency feuding with the kingdom. Now his administration is offering rare public rebukes (and much sharper private ones) of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s legal scheme. A president on icy terms with both Israel and Saudi Arabia may be disinclined to offer them incentives to make peace\u2014and if he does not, the Saudis may be in no rush to join the Abraham accords.\nThen there are the Palestinians, whom Mr Netanyahu would prefer to forget. King Salman, the nominal Saudi ruler, still feels for their plight, but he has largely delegated power to his son Muhammad, the crown prince. Younger Saudis have less sympathy for the cause. Still, if Israel annexes parts of the occupied West Bank, or takes similarly drastic steps, the Saudis are unlikely to sign a diplomatic agreement.\nIsrael\u2019s wars with its Arab neighbours have long kept its society united. Since 1967, when it occupied the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian issue has been the defining issue of Israeli politics. But as the Arab world has gradually accepted Israel\u2019s presence and hopes of resolving the conflict with the Palestinians have evaporated, the internal divisions over Israel\u2019s identity have sharpened. Mr Netanyahu has long exploited them, but now they are threatening to split Israel irrevocably. Mr Netanyahu wants peace with the Saudis to be his legacy.
