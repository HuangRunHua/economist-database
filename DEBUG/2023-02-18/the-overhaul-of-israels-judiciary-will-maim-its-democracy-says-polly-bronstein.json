That leaves the Israeli Supreme Court as the only institution that can balance executive decisions. Traditionally, the court has protected liberal values, especially in light of Israel\u2019s demographics and its lack of agreed-upon borders. Consider that about a fifth of Israel\u2019s 9m citizens are Arab and another 3m Palestinians live in the West Bank; some 10% of the country\u2019s Jewish population is ultra-Orthodox and another 20% is conservative. The rest are either more moderately devout or secular. The court occupies a critical position in a complex democracy. That is why government efforts to hurt the court\u2019s independence could be so dangerous.\nPrime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s latest government, which took power in December, is promoting a set of judicial reforms that would dramatically weaken the legal system and upend the balance between the court and the parliament. The proposed laws would allow politicians to appoint judges (at present a committee of ministers, parliamentarians, Supreme Court judges and lawyers does so); severely curtail the court\u2019s ability to revoke certain laws; and introduce an \u201coverride clause\u201d that allows a simple majority of 61 members of parliament to ignore a court decision. This will give the government almost absolute control of the judicial system and maim Israel\u2019s democracy.\nThis attack on the judiciary represents a new low point in an ongoing political crisis. Israel has endured five elections in four years, culminating in the creation of what Mr Netanyahu proudly calls \u201ca full-on right-wing government\u201d. But virtually half the country opposes the government and its reforms. This has led to the creation of a coalition of organisations, industries and groups that seldom co-operate: the tech industry, university students, law firms, LGBTQ- and women\u2019s-rights organisations, centre-left Zionist parties, groups that promote co-existence between Jews and Arabs, ex-officers in the Israel Defence Forces and others. In January the city of Tel Aviv hosted the biggest demonstration in more than a decade. More than 100,000 Israelis have taken to the streets to protest against the radical judicial overhaul. Mass protests are happening all over Israel now every weekend.\nThe crisis is rooted in issues raised by the settler movement. In the 1970s settlers were encouraged by Israel\u2019s government to build homes on land that was captured from Egypt during the six-day war of 1967. But 30 years later they were forced out by Ariel Sharon\u2019s government, which decided to leave the Gaza strip completely and turn it over to the Palestinians. Following the passage of the disengagement law in 2005, some 8,000 Jewish settlers were evacuated from their homes. The settlers appealed without success to the Supreme Court. Since then they have tried to weaken the court, which they saw as an accomplice in the destruction of their Gaza communities and violation of their civil rights. Then the Israeli courts were perceived as a barrier to settlement expansions in Gaza and the West Bank. They still are. They uphold Israeli law, and that law has never been declared sovereign in those areas. Ultra-Orthodox groups have increasingly adopted positions opposing the court, too. \nMr Netanyahu\u2019s party, Likud, started as a secular, right-wing party with a strong commitment to the freedom of the judiciary in the 1970s. But that has changed in recent years for two main reasons. The first is that settlers started to form the right-wing base of Likud, and so began to influence its politics. The second concerns Mr Netanhayu\u2019s own indictment in 2019 for bribery, fraud and breach of trust (he denies any wrongdoing). After the indictment, he had to sign a \u201cconflict-of-interest\u201d agreement, preventing him from initiating changes in the legal system or otherwise interfering in it. \nAlthough his trial is still ongoing, Mr Netanyahu\u2019s party is promoting judicial reform. As a result of his indictment, moderate and centrist parties shunned Mr Netanhayu, and he was forced to partner with the most aggressive and extreme right-wing parties to form a coalition. \nThe truth is that both sides have valid points that need to be addressed. The panel of the court\u2019s judges is still very homogenous and does not represent Israel\u2019s multi-ethnic society. So an improved process for appointing new judges needs to be agreed upon. Israel has also failed to make use of basic laws\u2014fundamental laws which take precedence over regular laws\u2014to codify important constitutional matters, such as how to define the balance between parliament and the court over legislation, and who can strike laws down.\nInstead the court makes use of the current vacuum, taking powers that were never formally given to it by any constitution or by parliament. These include the power to remove government ministers from their positions. Israel also needs to guarantee all human and civil rights in basic law, so that the court is not the only place that protects the rights of all Israelis. The priority should be to give the \u201cdeclaration of independence\u201d\u2014a well balanced and inspiring document that launched Israel in 1948 as the nation state of the Jewish people\u2014the status of basic law so it can serve as the first chapter of a new constitution.\nWhat Israel needs are sensible politicians who will lead a serious, deep and sincere process of negotiations between coalition and opposition. A change in Israel\u2019s judiciary system will happen\u2014it\u2019s one of the new government\u2019s most important pieces of legislation\u2014but reform should be responsible and balanced, not a destructive move against Israeli democracy. \u25a0  \nPolly Bronstein is the chief executive and founder of the One-Hundred Initiative, an Israeli think-tank and the author of the book \u201cHow I Became a Moderate\u2014A Journey from Left to Centre\u201d (2022).", "description": "A political activist argues that her country needs a constitution", "ogDescription": "A political activist argues that her country needs a constitution", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230211_BID001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-02-14T16:39:59Z", "dateModified": "2023-02-16T18:58:08Z", "dateCreated": "2023-02-14T16:38:40Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-02-18T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/r0rmljbaissvjubb83o70pf3lf0ikc7a", "publication": [{"id": "/content/uikaeciv75g3246h7f4vmeq5kjrj6cap", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/6jabi5kdosl37fovblsijkkbfuvakuse", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/adctqklsj6ku2jmkbmfc88tirt4ki4m4", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ijh4nfs6qnv8qj923lh0cqkoqv1j016n", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/38qf6dvei6p547eotjig7dl5k3tuuqro", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/drj26k74desaumjqrfdc0rq7nmaq7ns5", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/froc0eqpbfokc3uciihh72guqg1d0phv", "context": {"position": 350.75, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Asiwaju Bola Tinubu on why he is running to be Nigeria\u2019s president", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/02/15/asiwaju-bola-tinubu-on-why-he-is-running-to-be-nigerias-president", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3vdgn1aititedgjb315pdbed0g9pcd3j", "publication": [{"id": "/content/uikaeciv75g3246h7f4vmeq5kjrj6cap", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/6jabi5kdosl37fovblsijkkbfuvakuse", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/adctqklsj6ku2jmkbmfc88tirt4ki4m4", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ijh4nfs6qnv8qj923lh0cqkoqv1j016n", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/38qf6dvei6p547eotjig7dl5k3tuuqro", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/drj26k74desaumjqrfdc0rq7nmaq7ns5", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/froc0eqpbfokc3uciihh72guqg1d0phv", "context": {"position": 350.76, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Peter Obi on why he is running to be Nigeria\u2019s president", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/02/15/peter-obi-on-why-he-is-running-to-be-nigerias-president", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2qnkjtldk6p0p5k4qv2pdomfd1tqnofg", "publication": [{"id": "/content/uikaeciv75g3246h7f4vmeq5kjrj6cap", "context": {"position": 350.77, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/6jabi5kdosl37fovblsijkkbfuvakuse", "context": {"position": 350.77, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/adctqklsj6ku2jmkbmfc88tirt4ki4m4", "context": {"position": 350.77, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ijh4nfs6qnv8qj923lh0cqkoqv1j016n", "context": {"position": 350.77, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/38qf6dvei6p547eotjig7dl5k3tuuqro", "context": {"position": 350.77, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/drj26k74desaumjqrfdc0rq7nmaq7ns5", "context": {"position": 350.77, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/froc0eqpbfokc3uciihh72guqg1d0phv", "context": {"position": 350.77, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "The overhaul of Israel\u2019s judiciary will maim its democracy, says Polly Bronstein", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/02/14/the-overhaul-of-israels-judiciary-will-maim-its-democracy-says-polly-bronstein", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
