Individual acts of defiance are unusual in the age of Z (the symbol of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the nationalist mindset that goes with it). A collective endeavour such as this appears to trigger extreme emotions. The play being performed is a comic take on a biblical classic, but the contemporary allusions are not hard to fathom. \nIn a Sovietised version of Bethlehem, a paranoid, elderly autocrat is preparing for the slaughter of all young boys aged two and under. The newly born hero of the story\u2014not Jesus in this case, but \u201cLittle Sergei\u201d\u2014is saved when a guardian angel warns his parents to leave for Egypt before it is too late. Audience members who have been following social media know that the real-life inspiration for Little Sergei, Serhii Podlianov from Zaporizhia, was far less fortunate. He was killed in November by a Russian missile, aged just two days old. \nZhenya Berkovich, the play\u2019s writer and director, is a rare breed in today\u2019s Russia: a young creative type declining to take the heavy hints to shut up. Even as Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cspecial operation\u201d struggles to make progress in Ukraine, the fear and conformity it has instilled at home mean that domestically, at least, it is yielding real results. Since February 24th last year, when the current invasion began, authorities have used the crisis to try to yank Russian life from a Western trajectory, meddling in personal space, culture and even schools in a way not seen since the Soviet Union.\nIn the arts, the result has been a toxic mix of repression and preventive self-censorship. Together with a mass exodus of creative talent, this is arguably the biggest disruption to the course of Russian culture since Stalin\u2019s \u201ccultural revolution\u201d saw off the avant-garde in the benighted 1930s. In a telling indication of autocracy\u2019s limits, however, a push to foment an alternative pro-war culture has been markedly less successful.\n\nMs Berkovich says she is under little illusion about the reach and effects of her own work, which she describes as a \u201cmodest personal survival mechanism\u201d. Theatre touched only a tiny part of the population at the best of times, she says. In the context of Z-Russia, writing a play that \u201cemphasises the miracle of life\u201d was equivalent to no more than a \u201cmosquito dance\u201d. She sympathises with those who think politically engaged citizens should have different priorities now. But it is not a case of choosing between culture and conscience: \u201cYou should always choose both.\u201d\nNot all cultural figures share Ms Berkovich\u2019s fierce anti-war stance. Pragmatic silence is common. A fringe of loyalists such as Valery Gergiev, a conductor, and Vladimir Mashkov, a theatre director, openly embrace the war. At the most grotesque end of the spectrum is a new wave of Z-culture, which the Kremlin has actively promoted. So far the most prominent artist to have broken into the mainstream is the musician Shaman, who has taken to performing hits such as \u201cI\u2019m Russian\u201d\u2014\u201cI\u2019m Russian/I go to the end/I\u2019m Russian/My blood comes from my fa-aa-ther\u201d\u2014for the already war-shocked citizens of Donbas in occupied eastern Ukraine.\nSome unlikely figures have also begun dabbling in the arts scene. The warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2014whose Wagner brand is better known for executions by sledgehammer\u2014has opened a \u201ccultural\u201d and \u201cco-working\u201d space in St Petersburg. On January 21st the dystopian Wagner Centre hosted the opening of a new \u201canti-colonialist\u201d exhibition by Alexei Chizov, a local artist. \nThe aim of the show was to emphasise \u201cRussia\u2019s aesthetic and ethical sovereignty\u201d. But the confusing paintings, which depicted buff soldiers in poppy fields, left most of the visitors perplexed. Were they Wagner soldiers? (Apparently not: they were meant to be American.) One woman wondered aloud if the images were homoerotic, only to be drowned out with shouts of \u201cProvocation!\u201d\nThe comically middling talents of the pro-war culture legion have somewhat limited its impact. \u201cThe grey and talentless are trying to take the place of what the state is forbidding, but nobody wants to see it,\u201d says Anatoly Golubovsky, a critic. The trouble, from the authorities\u2019 point of view, is that \u201cnon-conformism happens to be better and more profitable.\u201d And with state funding scarce amid the war, cultural institutions are prioritising the bottom line. \nThe directors Dmitri Krymov, Aleksandr Molochnikov and Kirill Serebrennikov are all opposed to the war. But their plays, which are not themselves explicitly anti-war, are commercially successful and continue to be staged\u2014albeit, absurdly, with the directors\u2019 names removed. Bookshops still sell \u201cSummer in a Pioneer\u2019s Necktie\u201d, an LGBT-themed literary blockbuster, notwithstanding a criminal case over its alleged homosexual propaganda. Meanwhile cinemas across Moscow continue secretly to show Western films such as \u201cAvatar\u201d, despite international sanctions and the absence of a local licence. \nFlowers in the cracks\nThe life that continues in the gaps suggests government control is still some way short of Soviet totalitarianism. \u201cRussian reality is in fact a mix of off-the-scale cruelty and kindergarten idiocy, and sometimes one saves you from the other,\u201d says Ms Berkovich. All the same, the risks of stepping outside what counts as permissible in culture are real, and growing. \nMs Berkovich has already been threatened with prosecution. Her appearances at festivals have been cancelled at the last minute. An army of trolls has been attacking her on social media. For now, however, the director has decided against joining her creative peers in exile abroad. She sees a purpose in staying in Russia until that becomes impossible: \u201cPutinism isn\u2019t a geography, it\u2019s a time. You can try to close your window to stay warm, but it will still be cold on the street outside.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter", "description": "Repression can stifle a culture.
