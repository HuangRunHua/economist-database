But Ms Garc\u00eda is not here for the country\u2019s spectacular volcanoes. Latacunga is also home to a prison where 27 inmates died in riots in 2021. It was here, in a jail run by drug gangs, that her 74-year-old husband was sent after being convicted in absentia of embezzlement. He has cancer, but had to sleep on the floor in an overcrowded cell. He was beaten up. After three months Ms Garc\u00eda got him transferred to a lower-security prison. But by then incarceration had already taken its toll. \u201cHe\u2019s very skinny, he\u2019s aged a lot,\u201d she says, as she visits the jail to pick up his medical files. \nIn the Americas 376 of every 100,000 inhabitants are behind bars, more than twice as many as in any other region. Historically, that rate has been pushed up by the United States, which has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world: 629 people per 100,000. Other countries are now starting to catch up. In the two decades since 2000 the prison population in Central and South America has surged by 77% and 200%, according to the World Prison Brief, a database maintained by Birbeck, University of London.\nLatin America\u2019s prisons have little funding. In 2021 the average spent on an inmate in a state prison in Brazil, which has the third-largest prison population in the world, was $4,000 a year. That is about a tenth of the average spent in the United States. And the pandemic has worsened matters, increasing overcrowding and violence. Since December 2020, over 400 Ecuadorians have been killed because of gang warfare in prisons. In June last year 53 prisoners were killed in a riot in Colombia. \nIn a region with high crime rates, citizens have long favoured their leaders treating suspected criminals with mano dura, or an iron fist. The most extreme example of this is in El Salvador. In March 2022 a state of emergency was declared by President Nayib Bukele, after a spike of gang-related killings. Some 100,000 people, or 2% of Salvadorean adults, are now behind bars. The country\u2019s homicide rate has halved. Mr Bukele\u2019s approval rating is a whopping 90%, the highest in the region. \nBut the problem is that Latin American prisons offer little rehabilitation. Fewer than half of prisoners have access to work or education, and programmes that exist tend to be infrequent and short-term. As prison populations started to soar in the 1990s, reformist types who envisioned prisons as places for state-sponsored re-education were disappointed, says Giane Silvestre of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Instead it seemed that \u201cprisons are just a place to put undesirables.\u201d \nFew countries keep records on recidivism and different ways of measuring reoffending make them tricky to compare. But the data that exist are discouraging. In Brazil, according to a 14-year study published last year of more than 900,000 former prisoners convicted of drug crimes, violent crimes and theft, one in five ended up back in prison within a year and nearly 40% within five years. In the United States 45% of former inmates return to prison within five years, either on a new conviction or for violating the terms of their parole.\nOvercrowding means that many prisons are simply cages. The World Prison Brief estimates that Brazilian and Bolivian prisons are operating at 147% and 264% of capacity, respectively. Inmates report not receiving medical care. According to the World Health Organisation, a Salvadorean in prison is 99 times more likely than the national average to have tuberculosis. Often another consequence of overcrowding is violence. \nIn some prisons, the authorities work in tandem with inmates. Others are run entirely by prisoners, with staff guarding only the perimeter. At the extreme end are the Venezuelan pranes, or kingpins. They control 46% of the prison population, while state authorities govern 11% (the rest is under mixed control), according to the Venezuelan Prison Observatory, an NGO. This is the consequence of a policy from the 2010s when Iris Varela, the prisons minister, realised that the state alone could not control prison violence. She abdicated responsibility to the pranes, who built discotecas, swimming pools and zoos.\nIn Ecuador, where the government says that over a third of inmates belong to a criminal organisation, there is one prison guard for every 62 inmates (in the United States, that ratio ranges from 1:4 to 1:14). Outnumbered and underpaid, they sometimes join the gangs they are supposed to control. In recent years Ecuador has been hit by a wave of murders orchestrated by gang bosses behind bars. In the first eight months of 2022, the number of homicides doubled compared with the same period the previous year. The gangs that hang bodies off bridges were \u201cborn in the prisons\u201d, says Renato Riveira, a researcher. \nThe Mexicanisation of a region\nSome countries are trying to change. Of 25 Latin American countries, six have reduced their prison populations since 2018, according to the World Prison Brief. In Ecuador last year Guillermo Lasso, the president, announced plans to free 5,000 prisoners and hire more guards. \nSome prisoners were displeased with these plans. In November, in an apparent response to the transfer of gang bosses to higher-security prisons, gangsters in Guayaquil, Ecuador\u2019s second-largest city, threw explosives at petrol stations, police stations and a hospital, killing five police officers and a civilian. Such violence may make it hard to persuade society of the value of freeing less dangerous prisoners. \u25a0", "description": "And since the pandemic they have only got worse", "ogDescription": "And since the pandemic they have only got worse", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230218_AMP002.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-02-16T15:33:50Z", "dateModified": "2023-02-16T18:58:08Z", "dateCreated": "2023-02-15T11:52:36Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-02-18T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "LATACUNGA", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/fio72maijt3m8ur74rbga0dccfi356qc", "publication": [{"id": "/content/uikaeciv75g3246h7f4vmeq5kjrj6cap", "context": {"position": 600.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/6jabi5kdosl37fovblsijkkbfuvakuse", "context": {"position": 600.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/adctqklsj6ku2jmkbmfc88tirt4ki4m4", "context": {"position": 600.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ijh4nfs6qnv8qj923lh0cqkoqv1j016n", "context": {"position": 600.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/38qf6dvei6p547eotjig7dl5k3tuuqro", "context": {"position": 600.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/drj26k74desaumjqrfdc0rq7nmaq7ns5", "context": {"position": 600.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/froc0eqpbfokc3uciihh72guqg1d0phv", "context": {"position": 600.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Daniel Ortega expels 222 political prisoners from Nicaragua", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/02/16/daniel-ortega-expels-222-political-prisoners-from-nicaragua", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/9oppeontj344vctk7jg9i412ms278m3g", "publication": [{"id": "/content/uikaeciv75g3246h7f4vmeq5kjrj6cap", "context": {"position": 600.33, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/6jabi5kdosl37fovblsijkkbfuvakuse", "context": {"position": 600.33, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/adctqklsj6ku2jmkbmfc88tirt4ki4m4", "context": {"position": 600.33, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ijh4nfs6qnv8qj923lh0cqkoqv1j016n", "context": {"position": 600.33, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/38qf6dvei6p547eotjig7dl5k3tuuqro", "context": {"position": 600.33, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/drj26k74desaumjqrfdc0rq7nmaq7ns5", "context": {"position": 600.33, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/froc0eqpbfokc3uciihh72guqg1d0phv", "context": {"position": 600.33, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Latin America\u2019s prisons are overcrowded and violent", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/02/16/latin-americas-prisons-are-overcrowded-and-violent", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ks34i0kahft9jicvikcprg9n4bm2ulbl", "publication": [{"id": "/content/uikaeciv75g3246h7f4vmeq5kjrj6cap", "context": {"position": 600.31, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/6jabi5kdosl37fovblsijkkbfuvakuse", "context": {"position": 600.31, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/adctqklsj6ku2jmkbmfc88tirt4ki4m4", "context": {"position": 600.31, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ijh4nfs6qnv8qj923lh0cqkoqv1j016n", "context": {"position": 600.31, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/38qf6dvei6p547eotjig7dl5k3tuuqro", "context": {"position": 600.31, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/drj26k74desaumjqrfdc0rq7nmaq7ns5", "context": {"position": 600.31, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/froc0eqpbfokc3uciihh72guqg1d0phv", "context": {"position": 600.31, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Latin America\u2019s left-wing presidents risk stoking inflation", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/02/15/latin-americas-left-wing-presidents-risk-stoking-inflation", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
