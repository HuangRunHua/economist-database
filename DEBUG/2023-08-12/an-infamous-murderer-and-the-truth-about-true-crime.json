horse. At least that is how his neglectful mother and a farmhand on his parents\u2019 Irish estate recalled it. Wrong, insists Mr Macarthur: he tripped and fell on a rock. Likewise he denies suggestions that he suffered or witnessed regular abuse by his father\u2014experiences that might be linked by \u201ca thread of violence\u201d to the murders he went on to commit.\n\u201cA Thread of Violence\u201d is the title of Mark O\u2019Connell\u2019s new book about the Macarthur case. As the disputed horse-kick shows, he is careful to separate fact from rumour or surmise. His is a scrupulous, thoughtful work in the ubiquitous, often ghoulish genre of true crime. Yet despite his exacting standards, or because of them, readers may reach a harsher verdict on the genre itself.\nThe modern true-crime fad is generally traced to \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d, Truman Capote\u2019s landmark, fabrication-riddled book of 1966; but the idea can be tracked through Victorian \u201cpenny dreadfuls\u201d to early-modern murder ballads and beyond. In the 21st century it has been supercharged by cable television, streaming and podcasts, the bingeable formats fitting the suspenseful narratives like a felon\u2019s glove. As in the most successful, much-imitated examples\u2014\u201dSerial\u201d, \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d, \u201cThe Staircase\u201d\u2014Mr O\u2019Connell tells what he justifiably calls \u201ca terrific yarn\u201d.\nBy 1982, when he was 37, Mr Macarthur (pictured) had squandered his inheritance. A bow-tied dilettante with academic airs, he resolved to rob a bank and so preserve his \u201clanguid liberty\u201d. While stealing a getaway car and a gun, he needlessly killed Bridie Gargan, a nurse, and Donal Dunne, a farmer. He was caught in the home of a pal\u2014Patrick Connolly, Ireland\u2019s attorney-general. Charles Haughey, the country\u2019s premier, called the affair \u201cgrotesque\u201d, \u201cunbelievable\u201d, \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d, adjectives soon combined into what, in Ireland, is an enduring acronym: GUBU.\nMr Macarthur was released in 2012. Mr O\u2019Connell tracked him down on the streets of Dublin and weaves together an account of the murders, a chronicle of his talks with the killer and his own reflections. It is not only factual rigour that distinguishes his book from many true-crime tales on page and screen. He is respectful of the horror at its heart, eschewing cliffhangers and gore, and is straight with Mr Macarthur about his plans\u2014rebutting Janet Malcolm\u2019s famous claim in \u201cThe Journalist and the Murderer\u201d that, because they deceive their subjects, the work of reporters like him is \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d. \nIntellectually, he aims high. Like Dostoyevsky, whom he cites, Mr O\u2019Connell hopes to extrapolate essential verities of human nature from a single, extreme case: \u201cto understand the darkness and violence that run beneath the surface of so many lives\u201d. He wonders how Mr Macarthur copes with his guilt. His ultimate quarry is \u201cfor want of a better term, evil\u201d.\nThese are grand ambitions. They have to be if they are to offset the genre\u2019s costs, which Mr O\u2019Connell acknowledges and many true-crime fans sense queasily beneath the thrills. \nOccasionally true crime exposes police misconduct and helps finger culprits or rectify miscarriages of justice. More commonly it risks distressing victims\u2019 relatives (who, as here, often decline to speak to writers or producers). It blurs reality with fiction, not least among the amateur sleuths and vigilantes who obstruct some police inquiries. It services, but never satiates, grisly instincts of Schadenfreude and prurience. Bending the mess of life to fit the arc of a character or an episode, it mines suffering for entertainment.\nFor all the author\u2019s tact, Mr Macarthur does not give him what he wants, at vital moments retreating into creepily impersonal evasions (he refers to his murders as \u201cthe criminal episode\u201d). The inner truth remains obscured by a \u201cgiant redaction mark\u201d; like \u201ca startled animal\u201d, it vanishes into shadow if you reach for it.\nGuilty people lie to themselves. Rough childhoods can be damaging. Privilege can nurture a warped sense of entitlement. Such are the truisms that Mr O\u2019Connell comes away with. The criminal keeps his secrets. Evil slinks away.\nMr O\u2019Connell is a supple writer and penetrating thinker who secured extraordinary access to a notorious killer. Yet in its frankness and frustrations, his exemplary book may make you wonder how many more books or shows about monsters you should consume. The truth about true crime may be that it is hard to pull off with a conscience.\u25a0\nRead more from Back Story, our column on culture:\nBruce Springsteen turns back the clock\u2014and stops it (Jul
