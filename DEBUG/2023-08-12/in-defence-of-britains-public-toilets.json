Push open the door of the gentlemen\u2019s toilets beneath Wesley\u2019s Chapel in London and you find yourself in some of the oldest and grandest loos in the city. The sinks are marble; the cubicles are panelled wood and everywhere\u2014on the cisterns, on the ceramic pull chains, on the toilet bowls\u2014is the name of the man who made them: \u201cTHE VENERABLE THOMAS CRAPPER.\u201d These are a sanitary relic and a social one: toilets today rarely contain such pride.  \nBritish toilets are no longer Crapper; they are worse. The nation that gave the world the S-bend, the U-bend, the internationally used initialism of \u201cWC\u201d, and rebuilt its capital city to suit its sewage, is increasingly incapable of offering its residents usable public toilets. In the past two decades, 2,000-odd public loos\u2014a third of the total\u2014have closed in England and Wales; historic toilets have been neglected or converted into wine bars; those conveniences that remain are increasingly inconvenient and frequently filthy. Campaigners are cross: the Royal Society for Public Health published a paper on the \u201cDecline of the Great British Public Toilet\u201d entitled \u201cTaking the P***\u201d. British public toilets, once among the best in the world, are now\u2014a parable in porcelain\u2014at best bog standard. \nIt used to be so different. In the Victorian era London began what has been called a sanitary revolution. Like most, this one came from the bottom up. London was never a clean city: in 1660 the diarist Samuel Pepys went into his cellar and \u201cput my foot into a great heap of turds\u201d that had seeped in from a neighbour; by the Victorian era, London had 2m people and an even deeper problem. In 1855, the scientist Michael Faraday took a trip on the Thames and found \u201cthe whole of the river was an opaque, pale brown fluid\u201d, broiling with visible chunks of \u201cfeculence\u201d. Something, Faraday wrote, must be done. \nThen, as now, MPs were reluctant to talk about the lavatorial. As Raymond Martin, the head of the British Toilet Association, observes, \u201cNobody wants to be the Minister of Poo.\u201d But the unusually hot summer of 1858 concentrated both Faraday\u2019s feculent river and MPs\u2019 minds: some were seen staggering out of Parliament, \u201ceach man with a handkerchief to his nose\u201d. Within a few months, Parliament had passed a law and, since London had affluence as well as effluence, soon 265km of sewers had been built. As Adolf Loos, a pleasingly named architect, put it, in sanitation \u201cthe English are really the leaders\u201d. \nThe early history of women\u2019s liberation is often told using fancy abstract nouns such as \u201cemancipation\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d but women\u2019s freedom, then and now, is made possible by more humdrum concrete ones: by the pill, bank accounts and\u2014before those\u2014toilets. In the Victorian era women, trapped by the \u201curinary leash\u201d, had either to return home for toilets or, like genteel truckers, use bizarre glass bottles that they slipped under their skirts. \nIn 1893 the first women\u2019s toilets appeared on the Strand. When Selfridge\u2019s opened in 1909 it offered its clientele toilets: letting women \u201cspend a penny\u201d made it easier for them to shop for longer. This, says Clara Greed, a professor emerita of inclusive urban planning at the University of the West of England, Bristol, was \u201calmost revolutionary\u201d. \nThe bottom line\nA visitor to those revolutionary toilets is today met by a rusted chain on a wrought iron gate. \u201cThis facility is now closed\u201d reads a sign from the council, Westminster. It is within its rights to do so. Since 1848 councils have been allowed to provide public toilets, but no law obliges them to. Many have closed, since to keep toilets open is costly for councils: Healthmatic, a company that builds and manages public toilets, puts the price of a very busy public one at \u00a360,000-80,000 a year. Though that is perhaps cheaper than the alternative: Westminster spends \u00a3950k a year cleaning up after public urination. \nThe lack of loos leaves many\u2014pregnant women, those looking after small children, the incontinent\u2014feeling desperate. Women are disproportionately affected, but not solely so. One 1937 report by Mass Observation, a social-research unit, records how its author, unable to reach a loo on a crowded train, chose to \u201cgradually relieve myself into my trousers and hope for the best\u201d. Builders, taxi drivers and truckers all suffer, says Gail Ramster, a researcher and the co-creator of the Great British Public Toilet Map. When she researched toilet use \u201cmost of the public toilets in London had vastly more male users than female\u201d. Litter-pickers complain about numbers of bottles of yellow fluid at roadsides. \nBritain is not bereft of toilets: Ms Ramster\u2019s map lists over 10,000 \u201cpublicly-accessible toilets\u201d in shops, restaurants and pubs, paid for by a coffee or a sheepish look. As Selfridge knew, sanitation can be symbiotic: McDonald\u2019s is almost as well-loved for its regularly checked loos as its regular fries; the pub chain JD Wetherspoon is celebrated by toilet experts such as Mr Martin for providing clean, spacious facilities. The chain\u2019s founder, Tim Martin, honed these to compete on crowded high streets. Toilets, he thinks, are \u201ca significant percentage of the appeal of the pubs.\u201d\nUK Plc seems less bothered. In many countries, fine toilets are still a matter of pride. But while toilet academics speak wistfully of facilities in China and Japan, English ones attract such adjectives as \u201cnot clean\u201d. Britain, says Professor Greed, is \u201cgoing backwards.\u201d\u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "description": "Britain\u2019s toilets used to be Crapper.
