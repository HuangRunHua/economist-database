Mr Lee, the chief executive, said \u201cdestructive forces\u201d in Hong Kong were often engaging in soft resistance \u201cbelow the red line of lawbreaking\u201d. The idea, it appears, is to keep people well clear of that line by blurring it. Hong Kong\u2019s two main party-controlled newspapers, Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, attack those who stray too close. Their commentaries are widely assumed to reflect the views of mainland officials who pull the strings of Hong Kong\u2019s government from behind the scenes. \nLeticia Wong is someone in their sights. She runs a small bookshop called Hunter in Sham Shui Po, one of the city\u2019s poorer neighbourhoods and a magnet for young, upwardly mobile people in search of cheap accommodation. Ms Wong, who is 30, resigned from her elected post on a local council in 2021 after the government required every public-office holder to swear an oath of loyalty to the People\u2019s Republic. She believed she would be disqualified for being insincere. Ms Wong opened Hunter last year, offering books related to the protests of 2019 and other sensitive topics.\nEven under the national-security law, specific books are rarely banned in Hong Kong. Last year, however, five speech therapists were jailed for sedition. Their crime was to publish a children\u2019s book that seemed to portray Hong Kongers as sheep fending off wolves (apparently representing China). And self-censorship abounds. Libraries have removed works they believe may fall foul of the new law: books about the pro-democracy upheaval that engulfed mainland China in 1989, for example, or those written by Hong Kong\u2019s jailed activists. In May Mr Lee said public libraries should ensure they do not \u201cspread any kind of messages that are not in the interests of Hong Kong\u201d. He also noted that books about the Tiananmen Square protests could be found in private shops. If people \u201cwant to buy, they can buy\u201d, he said. That is true, but the campaign against soft resistance may change that. \nIn May an article in Ta Kung Pao featured Ms Wong and her bookshop. \u201cHer anti-China, chaos-inducing evildoing in Hong Kong has long been known to everyone,\u201d it said. \u201cAfter the implementation of Hong Kong\u2019s national-security law, she still did not repent\u2026She continued engaging in soft resistance by selling books that are anti-government or confrontational.\u201d Ms Wong laughs at this\u2014such accusations drive up footfall, she says. \u201cMore people come to buy books and see if I\u2019m still alive.\u201d Nearly a third of her customers are from the mainland, she reckons.\nMs Wong still pushes the envelope. In July she organised a book fair in a room above a nearby clothing shop. It provided a handful of independent publishers with space to display works of a kind unlikely to be seen in the territory\u2019s official book fair that was being held in a convention centre. A popular offering at Ms Wong\u2019s event was \u201cDeaf Voice in Court\u201d, a book about the travails of defendants with hearing difficulties, including someone charged with assaulting a policeman during the protests in 2019. Ta Kung Pao said that among the \u201cmain attractions\u201d of the official event was an updated edition of \u201cAn Outline for the Study of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d. Mr Xi is China\u2019s leader. \nBut Ms Wong is pessimistic. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are smart enough to leave some room for Hong Kong people like me,\u201d she says. On Facebook, she hinted at the political pressures facing her. She said she thought her bookshop would not survive to put on another fair next year. \n\nThe soft-resistance label is being attached even to people who are far removed from the front lines of dissent. In May a full-page article in Wen Wei Po attacked activists who have been campaigning on behalf of residents of Hong Kong\u2019s notorious \u201csubdivided flats\u201d: small apartments that have been converted into multiple dwellings, often with only just enough room to fit in two bunk beds (see chart). Such accommodation has been multiplying in recent years to satisfy demand from people who are on years-long waiting lists for public housing, or unable to afford the sky-high prices of property. \nChinese officials say grievances over Hong Kong\u2019s acute shortage of affordable housing were a leading cause of the unrest in 2019. The city\u2019s government has vowed to speed up construction of subsidised flats. Yet Wen Wei Po suggested that complaining about these efforts could spark renewed unrest. It said vigilance was needed against people who use the housing issue as a form of soft resistance by arousing \u201cnegative emotions among citizens\u201d. A sinister-looking graphic showed recent tiny housing-related protests morphing into tear-gas filled scenes from 2019. \nSoft resistance may get harder\nEyes are now turning to new security-related legislation that the government says it will enact this year or next. Doing so is mandated by Article 23 of Hong Kong\u2019s constitution, the Basic Law, but public misgivings\u2014highlighted by a massive protest in 2003\u2014have delayed the task until now. Ominously, Mr Tang, the security chief, told Wen Wei Po in July that drafters of the bill were \u201cpaying attention to soft resistance\u201d as well as \u201cloopholes\u201d in existing law involving the internet. \nKiwi Chow, a film-maker, is feeling the chill in his business. Two years ago his documentary about the unrest of 2019, \u201cRevolution of Our Times\u201d, became a hit among Hong Kongers abroad (cinemas in the territory will not show it). His most recent movie, a romantic comedy, has nothing to do with politics. Yet his mere association with a protest-related film sent investors and actors scurrying. To complete it, he had to raise money from friends. His family fears he may be arrested at any time, he says. But he brushes off the government\u2019s warnings about soft resistance. \u201cI won\u2019t try to guess what they want, because that would keep haunting me.\u201d \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to

discontent in Hong Kong in 2019 prompted China to impose a draconian national-security law on the territory to prevent further protests. Officials say this has helped: Hong Kong has achieved a \u201cmajor transition from chaos to order\u201d, they insist. But even after thousands of arrests and numerous trials, both under the new law and dredged-up statutes from the colonial era, the authorities are twitchy. Increasingly, they warn of \u201csoft resistance\u201d that could trigger fresh unrest. A new phase may be unfolding in Hong Kong\u2019s war on dissent. \nFor more than three years, fear instilled by the national-security law and other signs of China\u2019s tightening grip on the territory has deterred most people with political grievances from attempting to stage demonstrations. Until they were scrapped in December, covid-related restrictions on public gatherings may also have helped to keep protesters off the streets. Some of those who were at the forefront of the months-long upheaval in 2019 have fled. Since then, Hong Kong has seen its biggest wave of emigration in decades and the labour force has shrunk by over 5%.  \nThough cowed, Hong Kong still feels different from cities on the Chinese mainland. Controls on speech, news media, books and culture are less sweeping. China\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall\u201d does not surround its internet: sites such as Facebook and Google are not blocked in Hong Kong. In the rest of China, the Communist Party is omnipresent. In Hong Kong it operates largely out of sight, its watchful eyes not so keenly sensed in people\u2019s day-to-day lives. Opportunities for the government\u2019s critics to express themselves have become scarcer (since 2019 pro-democracy types have been purged from Hong Kong\u2019s political institutions). But they do, precariously, exist. \nOn July 28th Hong Kong\u2019s High Court rejected a government request to ban a favourite protest song that demonstrators sang in 2019, saying an injunction could undermine \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d. (The government has filed an appeal.) Such a ruling would be unthinkable on the mainland. Equally unimaginable would be the kind of access given to the public (including foreign visitors\u2014no ID required) to observe Hong Kong\u2019s national-security trials. These are grim, juryless spectacles, but local media give accounts of proceedings. Citizen journalists help provide extra detail of defendants\u2019 feisty testimony. \nBut many Hong Kongers wonder how much longer the territory can retain these shreds of distinctiveness. Their fears have been stoked by officials\u2019 remarks about soft resistance. No authoritative definition has been given of the term, but it appears to refer to a broader range of activity than the crimes of subversion, secession and the like that are covered by the national-security act and the territory\u2019s anti-sedition law (a long-disused relic of British rule that is enjoying a new lease of life). The way the term is often used by party-controlled media suggests it could apply to any political activity that the government dislikes. \nIt was a mainland official, Luo Huining, who raised the idea that Hong Kongers were putting up soft resistance. In 2021 Mr Luo, who was then the central government\u2019s most senior emissary in Hong Kong, called for such behaviour to be \u201cregulated by law\u201d. He did not elaborate. \nIn recent months officials in Hong Kong have picked up on the theme. Their strident tones on the subject suggest a push from Beijing. \u201cVarious acts of soft resistance continue to occur and spread through online media, cultural and artistic channels,\u201d said John Lee, the territory\u2019s chief executive, in June. \u201cThese latent forces could erupt at any time, endangering national security and disrupting social peace.\u201d Later that month he told state television that such acts required Hong Kong to be \u201cespecially vigilant\u201d. On July 24th, in response to a local newspaper, Hong Kong\u2019s security chief, Chris Tang, said there must be \u201cabsolutely no compromise\u201d on the matter. \u201cIt is imperative that we fight soft resistance with all our strength.\u201d\nThe court\u2019s decision not to outlaw the protest song, \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d, is a hiccup. The anthem\u2019s circulation online has been cited by pro-government media as an example of soft resistance (as has the alleged leniency of some judges when sentencing protesters). But the impact will be minor. Two of the song\u2019s lines echo the words of a protest slogan\u2014\u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d\u2014which the government has declared subversive. Police have swooped on the handful of individuals who have dared to play the tune in public since the imposition of the national-security law. The court\u2019s ruling is unlikely to encourage more to try. \nBlurred red lines\nOfficials\u2019 talk of soft resistance replicates a tactic often used by their counterparts on the mainland: that of sowing fear with vaguely worded warnings rather than explicit reference to laws. Mr Lee, the chief executive, said \u201cdestructive forces\u201d in Hong Kong were often engaging in soft resistance \u201cbelow the red line of lawbreaking\u201d. The idea, it appears, is to keep people well clear of that line by blurring it. Hong Kong\u2019s two main party-controlled newspapers, Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, attack those who stray too close. Their commentaries are widely assumed to reflect the views of mainland officials who pull the strings of Hong Kong\u2019s government from behind the scenes. \nLeticia Wong is someone in their sights. She runs a small bookshop called Hunter in Sham Shui Po, one of the city\u2019s poorer neighbourhoods and a magnet for young, upwardly mobile people in search of cheap accommodation. Ms Wong, who is 30, resigned from her elected post on a local council in 2021 after the government required every public-office holder to swear an oath of loyalty to the People\u2019s Republic. She believed she would be disqualified for being insincere. Ms Wong opened Hunter last year, offering books related to the protests of 2019 and other sensitive topics.\nEven under the national-security law, specific books are rarely banned in Hong Kong. Last year, however, five speech therapists were jailed for sedition. Their crime was to publish a children\u2019s book that seemed to portray Hong Kongers as sheep fending off wolves (apparently representing China). And self-censorship abounds. Libraries have removed works they believe may fall foul of the new law: books about the pro-democracy upheaval that engulfed mainland China in 1989, for example, or those written by Hong Kong\u2019s jailed activists. In May Mr Lee said public libraries should ensure they do not \u201cspread any kind of messages that are not in the interests of Hong Kong\u201d. He also noted that books about the Tiananmen Square protests could be found in private shops. If people \u201cwant to buy, they can buy\u201d, he said. That is true, but the campaign against soft resistance may change that. \nIn May an article in Ta Kung Pao featured Ms Wong and her bookshop. \u201cHer anti-China, chaos-inducing evildoing in Hong Kong has long been known to everyone,\u201d it said. \u201cAfter the implementation of Hong Kong\u2019s national-security law, she still did not repent\u2026She continued engaging in soft resistance by selling books that are anti-government or confrontational.\u201d Ms Wong laughs at this\u2014such accusations drive up footfall, she says. \u201cMore people come to buy books and see if I\u2019m still alive.\u201d Nearly a third of her customers are from the mainland, she reckons.\nMs Wong still pushes the envelope. In July she organised a book fair in a room above a nearby clothing shop. It provided a handful of independent publishers with space to display works of a kind unlikely to be seen in the territory\u2019s official book fair that was being held in a convention centre. A popular offering at Ms Wong\u2019s event was \u201cDeaf Voice in Court\u201d, a book about the travails of defendants with hearing difficulties, including someone charged with assaulting a policeman during the protests in 2019. Ta Kung Pao said that among the \u201cmain attractions\u201d of the official event was an updated edition of \u201cAn Outline for the Study of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d. Mr Xi is China\u2019s leader. \nBut Ms Wong is pessimistic. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are smart enough to leave some room for Hong Kong people like me,\u201d she says. On Facebook, she hinted at the political pressures facing her. She said she thought her bookshop would not survive to put on another fair next year. \n\nThe soft-resistance label is being attached even to people who are far removed from the front lines of dissent. In May a full-page article in Wen Wei Po attacked activists who have been campaigning on behalf of residents of Hong Kong\u2019s notorious \u201csubdivided flats\u201d: small apartments that have been converted into multiple dwellings, often with only just enough room to fit in two bunk beds (see chart). Such accommodation has been multiplying in recent years to satisfy demand from people who are on years-long waiting lists for public housing, or unable to afford the sky-high prices of property. \nChinese officials say grievances over Hong Kong\u2019s acute shortage of affordable housing were a leading cause of the unrest in 2019. The city\u2019s government has vowed to speed up construction of subsidised flats. Yet Wen Wei Po suggested that complaining about these efforts could spark renewed unrest. It said vigilance was needed against people who use the housing issue as a form of soft resistance by arousing \u201cnegative emotions among citizens\u201d. A sinister-looking graphic showed recent tiny housing-related protests morphing into tear-gas filled scenes from 2019. \nSoft resistance may get harder\nEyes are now turning to new security-related legislation that the government says it will enact this year or next. Doing so is mandated by Article 23 of Hong Kong\u2019s constitution, the Basic Law, but public misgivings\u2014highlighted by a massive protest in 2003\u2014have delayed the task until now. Ominously, Mr Tang, the security chief, told Wen Wei Po in July that drafters of the bill were \u201cpaying attention to soft resistance\u201d as well as \u201cloopholes\u201d in existing law involving the internet. \nKiwi Chow, a film-maker, is feeling the chill in his business. Two years ago his documentary about the unrest of 2019, \u201cRevolution of Our Times\u201d, became a hit among Hong Kongers abroad (cinemas in the territory will not show it). His most recent movie, a romantic comedy, has nothing to do with politics. Yet his mere association with a protest-related film sent investors and actors scurrying. To complete it, he had to raise money from friends. His family fears he may be arrested at any time, he says. But he brushes off the government\u2019s warnings about soft resistance. \u201cI won\u2019t try to guess what they want, because that would keep haunting me.\u201d \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to
