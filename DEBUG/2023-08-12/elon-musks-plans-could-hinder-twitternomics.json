"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/07/elon-musks-plans-could-hinder-twitternomics", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Elon Musk is no fan of the Federal Reserve. At least a dozen times over the past year the owner of X (a firm until recently known as Twitter) has savaged America\u2019s central bank for raising interest rates. Last December, for instance, he tweeted that its hikes might go down as the \u201cmost damaging ever\u201d. But Mr Musk\u2019s disdain for the Fed is not mirrored by the Fed\u2019s attitude towards X. On the contrary, the central bank\u2019s researchers rather like the website, treating it as a compelling barometer of the economy.\nThis puts X in a peculiar position. Its value as a business remains dubious, which is why Mr Musk has been scrambling to remake it, with changes including (but not limited to) the company\u2019s name. But its value to the economy is a different story altogether. The firm can serve as a timely indicator of both fundamental trends and market sentiment.\nThere is a large, growing literature on how to decode economic signals from social-media sites, ranging from Facebook to Reddit. Yet even in the sea of online information and commentary, Mr Musk\u2019s stands out. Others simply cannot match its volume and frequency. By 2013 Twitter users were already producing more than 5,700 posts in a second. By 2016 Instagram\u2019s larger user base was producing only 1,000. Three papers recently published by the Fed explore the platform\u2019s economic contributions. \nThe first is as a predictor of markets. Sentiment gleaned from tweets seems to be rather good at presaging short-term movements in both share prices and bond yields. In one paper a group of economists including Francisco Vazquez-Grande sifted 4.4m finance-related tweets posted between 2007 and April 2023 to create a Twitter Financial Sentiment Index. They used a machine-learning model to measure each tweet\u2019s sentiments: a message about stocks going to the Moon would be positive; Mr Musk\u2019s quips about the Fed would presumably count as negative.\nThe index, they find, correlates tightly with corporate-bond spreads (the difference between yields on corporate and government bonds, which usually widens as investors turn pessimistic). More than merely shadowing financial movements, posts can even foreshadow them. The overnight index before the stockmarket\u2019s open dovetails with the coming day\u2019s equity returns. A separate paper by Clara Vega and colleagues finds that the website\u2019s sentiment also closely tracks Treasury yields. Indeed, the correlation is stronger with tweets than with sentiment measures gleaned from the Fed\u2019s own official communications.\nA second use of tweets is as a gauge of economic conditions. Posts about job losses in particular seem to offer timely information about the labour market. Tomaz Cajner and co-authors construct a separate machine-learning model to digest posts with keywords such as \u201clost job\u201d or \u201cpink slip\u201d. Their measure of job losses mirrors official data on employment levels from 2015 to 2023. This correlation is potentially powerful because most government statistics appear with a lag, whereas the tweets are available immediately. Twitter, for example, would have provided a ten-day advantage in detecting the collapse in employment at the height of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\nThe Fed papers also see a third use for tweets: as a bellwether of sorts for monetary policy. Ms Vega and colleagues find that the social-media site fares better than changes in bond yields in predicting monetary-policy decisions on the day of their announcement. The Twitter sentiment index, meanwhile, is good at anticipating shocks from tighter policy such as rate increases. Tweets tend to turn sour just ahead of these moves. (That the website wastes no time in turning bitter will come as little surprise to regular users.)\nNo one is about to ascribe powers of causation to X. The social-media posts instead reflect broader feelings that are already coursing through financial markets. Still, the cornucopia of tweets does provide an additional way of measuring such sentiment, which, if proved valid over time, would be highly valuable.\nBeyond the Fed, some analysts are also finding other potential applications. Agust\u00edn Indaco of Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar calculates that the volume of tweeting alone can account for about three-quarters of cross-country variation in GDP. Rather like satellite images of night lights, tweets may therefore be a way of observing economic health without relying so heavily on tardy official statistics. This metric may work best in poorer countries, where heavy posting on social media would be a proxy for the state of telecommunications and use of smartphones.\nMarking the spot\nIf X is so economically useful, why is it not more lucrative? The various papers do not venture so far as to examine the gulf between Twitter\u2019s struggle for profitability and its evident utility\u2014not just as an economic tool but as a platform for sharing information, opinions, jokes and more. Mr Musk was onto something when he described the firm as a \u201ccommon digital town square\u201d. The problem in economic terms is that a town square falls into the category of public goods such as parks and clean water. Although public goods can be privately owned, it is notoriously hard to extract profits from them given that, by definition, it is difficult to charge people for all the benefits they confer.\nMr Musk is doing his darnedest to shift the economic equation at X by giving additional privileges to users who pay $8 a month for the site\u2019s blue-check verification. Tweets by users who cough up now receive extra promotion, among other benefits, showing up more often in the feeds of other people on the website. That, however, sets up a trade-off. Paid-for tweets may start crowding out better-informed posts from users who would rather not subscribe to the website. Over time, a website that prioritises payment over credibility will function less well as a town square and, by extension, as an economic indicator. The gain to X\u2019s finances would be a loss to the Fed\u2019s economists. \u25a0\nRead more from Free exchange, our column on economics:\nDeflation is curbing China\u2019s economic rise (Jul
