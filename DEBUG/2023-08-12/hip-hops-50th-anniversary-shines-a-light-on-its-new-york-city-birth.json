"Article", "articleBody": "ON AUGUST 11TH 1973 Cindy Campbell, hoping to raise money to buy school clothes, hosted a \u201cjam\u201d in the rec room of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, the apartment building where she and her family lived. Admission for girls was 25 cents. For \u201cfellas\u201d it was 50 cents. Her 18-year-old brother, Clive, better known as Kool Herc, dj\u2019d.\nHis turntables, mixer, enormous speakers and amplifiers pumped out tunes and beats into the wee hours. He repeated instrumental breaks to lengthen the most danceable part of songs. The \u201cbreak\u201d dancers became known as b-boys and b-girls. A friend, Coke La Rock, hyped up the crowd. It was not called hip-hop yet, but that \u201cjam\u201d is widely recognised as the start of a culture and society-changing type of music that became more than just a genre.\nThe Bronx was the centre of the new movement. DJs played on the city\u2019s streets and in its parks, siphoning electricity from lamp-posts to pump up the volume. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five attracted throngs of fans first at block parties, parks and then at clubs. Before he was even a teenager, Grandmaster Wizzard Theodore invented record \u201cscratching\u201d. Most songs were party anthems until Melle Mel\u2019s \u201cthe Message\u201d, hip-hop\u2019s first socially conscious song and one of the best hip-hop singles ever. Its scathing lyrics depicted a bleak Bronx and resonated beyond New York\u2019s five boroughs. \u201cBroken glass everywhere. People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don\u2019t care\u2026 Don\u2019t push me \u2019cause I\u2019m close to the edge\u201d.\nChuck D, Public Enemy\u2019s front man, once said that \u201cRap is Black America\u2019s TV station. It gives a whole perspective of what exists and what black life is all about.\u201d Darryl McDaniels, the DMC of Run-DMC, the first hip-hop group to go platinum, is still in awe of hip-hop\u2019s pioneers. \u201cWhen I saw a flyer with Grandmaster Flash\u2019s and Melle Mel\u2019s names on it, it was like Batman and Spider-Man really exists.\u201d He is disappointed that many top rappers today perform without a DJ. \u201cIt\u2019s not hip-hop.\u201d\nThe four elements of hip-hop are the DJ, the MC, b-boys and graffiti. At first the MC (master of ceremonies) amped the crowd, but eventually took centre-stage with rhymes and witty lyrics. The b-boys and b-girls popped and locked during the DJ\u2019s breaks. Modern graffiti, which began in Philadelphia, became an art form in New York City. Eric Felisbret, author of \u201cGraffiti New York\u201d, says that graffiti is often the \u201cstepchild\u201d of hip-hop, probably because it was difficult to commodify. Hip-hop now includes language (bling), film, fashion and politics (Eric Adams, New York\u2019s mayor, calls himself the hip-hop mayor).\nHip-hop has gone from block parties in the Bronx to become a global phenomenon. \u201cYou never thought that hip-hop would take it this far,\u201d as Biggie Smalls astutely observed in his 1994 hit \u201cJuicy\u201d. Auction houses that sell Old Masters paintings now have hip-hop collections on the calendar. \u201cThere\u2019s a small supply and high demand for the materials,\u201d says Cassandra Hatton, global head of science and pop culture at Sotheby\u2019s. At a recent anniversary auction, early hip-hop flyers and Polaroid photos were hot commodities. Monica Lynch, a former president of Tommy Records who launched the careers of Queen Latifah and Naughty by Nature, contributed to the auction. \nCity Hall has organised block parties in each borough to celebrate the anniversary. LL Cool J, a hip-hop legend, hosted a concert with an impressive line-up, which included Run-DMC, Roxanne Shant\u00e9, an early female rapper, and De La Soul. Yankee Stadium will also stage a celebratory concert. \u201cWe gotta use the anniversary as an opportunity,\u201d says Mr McDaniels. Hip-hop \u201cstill has a lot of work to do\u201d.\nHip-hop artists are of their communities. A Tribe Called Quest reminisced about Linden Boulevard in \u201cCheck the Rhime\u201d. Fat Joe rapped of Trinity Avenue. Cam\u2019ron\u2019s rhymes include his childhood address: \u201cI\u2019m from 101 West to Hund-fortieth, the shit is live. 5th floor.\u201d Run-DMC rapped about Christmas in Hollis, their Queens neighbourhood. \u201cPlace has a whole lot to do with hip-hop,\u201d says A.D. Carson, a professor of hip-hop at the University of Virginia, \u201ceven if the places are digital places or digital space.\u201d\nRayZa, a Bronx rapper who is also a guide for Hush Hip-Hop Tours, points out almost breathlessly all the hip-hop landmarks on a recent tour of the South Bronx and Harlem. Forest Houses is where Fat Joe grew up. Disco Fever nightclub, now a furniture shop, is where Grandmaster Flash spun. West 139th Street is where Jay-Z rap-battled with Big L. A mural depicts Big Pun. And the rec room at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.\nTo many, including RayZa, it is sacred ground. \u201cWithout that room, the culture wouldn\u2019t exist. There\u2019d be no Jay-Z, no LL Cool J, no Roxanne Shant\u00e9, no me, no Ice-T, no Ice-Cube, no NWA. Imagine no NWA.\u201d RayZa is certain that thousands of years from now, people will look at the rec room the way we look at the pyramids. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna come to a point where they\u2019re gonna charge thousands of dollars to touch it.\u201d \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American
