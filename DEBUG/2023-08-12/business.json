escalated its tech wars with China when Joe Biden issued an executive order banning future private-equity and venture-capital investments in certain advanced technologies in China, namely artificial intelligence, quantum computing and semiconductors. All companies investing in those industries in China will also have to inform the government of their activities. The administration said the decision was taken on grounds of national security, but it risks undermining an effort to ease diplomatic tensions with Beijing. \n\nChina\u2019s consumer-price index fell by 0.3% in July, year on year. The index of factory-gate prices slumped by 4.4%. China had been teetering on the brink of deflation for months, as the rebound from lockdowns fizzled out. The value of Chinese exports declined by 14.5% in July at an annual rate, the biggest drop since the start of the pandemic.\nThe competition between America and Europe to attract investment in chipmaking heated up when TSMC, a big Taiwanese semiconductor company, said it would build a factory in Germany. TSMC is spending \u20ac3.5bn ($3.8bn) on the project; the German government is stumping up another \u20ac5bn. The EU recently approved the Chips Act, a package of subsidies that aims to double the EU\u2019s global share in chipmaking from 10% to \u201cat least\u201d 20% by 2030. \nSoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund made its first investment gain in over a year during the latest quarter, though the Japanese tech conglomerate racked up another heavy net loss. SoftBank said it would begin to invest again, especially in AI, but would do so \u201ctimidly, with fear in our hearts\u201d. Meanwhile a slew of tech giants, including Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Samsung, were reported to be lining up to take stakes in Arm, a chip designer, when SoftBank floats the firm on the stockmarket in September. \nWeWork, one of SoftBank\u2019s worst bets in recent years, warned of a \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its \u201cability to continue as a going concern\u201d. The provider of shared working spaces said that a surplus of commercial property and economic uncertainty had contributed to its problems. Its stock slumped. WeWork was once valued at $47bn. It is now worth around $275m. \nBlown off course \nSiemens Energy, a big provider of wind power, warned that its losses this year are expected to reach \u20ac4.5bn ($5bn) because of ongoing problems with rotor blades and bearings in certain onshore turbines. It also said that offshore projects \u201calready committed to contractually cannot be completed profitably if implemented by the customer\u201d. Vestas, the world\u2019s biggest provider of wind turbines, reported a quarterly loss (though it hopes to turn an annual profit). As demand for wind power has soared, the industry is beset by rising costs, supply-chain problems and backlogs. \nNovo Nordisk released the results from the latest trial of its obesity drug, Wegovy, which found that patients who took the treatment had a 20% lower chance of suffering a heart attack or stroke. Meanwhile Eli Lilly upped its revenue and profit forecasts amid surging sales of its diabetes and weight-loss medicine. The share prices of both companies hit record highs. \nAfter a turbulent few years, during which it got caught up in Hong Kong\u2019s political upheavals and was hit hard by the pandemic, Cathay Pacific reported a six-month net profit of HK$4.3bn ($550m), its best first-half performance since 2010. The airline expects to reach 70% of its pre-pandemic capacity by the end of the year, compared with 3% a year ago. \nDisney reported another drop in subscribers for its streaming services, but the business\u2019s loss in the latest quarter narrowed to $512m from over $1bn a year ago. The company announced more big price rises, lifting the cost of subscribing to the ad-free version of Disney+ by 27%. \nSimon & Schuster, one of the big publishing houses in America, was sold to KKR, a private-equity firm, for $1.6bn. The deal comes less than a year after an attempt by Penguin Random House to take over its smaller rival was blocked on antitrust grounds. \nGet back to your desk\nZoom has told employees to return to the office at least two days a week. In May the company\u2019s boss, Eric Yuan, said it was hard to force workers back and that letting \u201cemployees work anywhere has sort of become a fashion\u201d. Zoom\u2019s technology enabled the shift to remote working during the pandemic more than anything else. Lauded as a permanent change to working patterns, there is now a move by corporations to curtail the practice. Even America\u2019s federal government is clamping down on working from home. \nSaudi Aramco\u2019s profit dived by 38% in the second quarter, year on year.
