ground on February 20, 2023 in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. She and fellow paramedics, volunteering for Hospitallers, live in hidden locations close to the fighting, providing additional manpower and resources for evacuations to the military, which is often stretched thin. Hospitallers is a Ukrainian voluntary organization of doctors and paramedics who treat and evacuate soldiers from the battlefield. The group has more than 500 volunteers who work in two-week shifts as emergency responders. The organization relies on donations, both domestic and international, to fund the vast operation, including purchasing medical supplies and supporting the logistical needs of staff operating 32 ambulances and 76 pickup trucks, most in the war-torn Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The volunteer paramedics come from a wide array of professions prior to joining Hospitallers and going through medical training. All are driven by the need to help in the war effort and relieve suffering of wounded Ukrainian soldiers. \"Kava\" which means coffee in Ukrainian, previously owned a coffee shop in Severodonetsk, which now is in Russian occupied Ukraine.

In it, hackers conducted perhaps the largest ever assault on computer networks. Ukraine, well-prepared and supported by foreign tech companies and allies, parried many of these blows, keeping communications and crucial government services online against all expectations. But the cyberwar, like the physical one, is evolving.\nRussian cyber-forces, portrayed as lumbering bumblers, have in fact adapted to circumstances, argues Dan Black, who served in NATO\u2019s cyber-threat analysis branch until December and now works for Mandiant, a cyber-security firm within Google. During its offensive in eastern Ukraine between April and July, Russia expanded its cyber-operations in Poland and eastern Europe to collect intelligence on arms shipments to Ukraine. The GRU, Russia\u2019s military-intelligence agency, began using more malware from criminal markets to augment fancier home-made tools.\nIn a paper for the IISS, a think-tank, Mr Black says Russian forces showed signs of \u201ca more prepared and reinvigorated cyber-programme\u201d from October, during Ukrainian offensives in the south and east. That included heightened cyber-attacks against energy, water and logistics targets in parallel with drone and missile strikes on Ukraine\u2019s power grid. This pointed to a co-ordinated strategy to ratchet up cross-domain pressure, he argues. A report published by Ukraine\u2019s main cyber-security agency on March 8th showed that \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201chigh-severity\u201d cyber-incidents, the two most serious sorts, leapt in December, reaching the highest level since the first week of the war. \nThat pressure is still building. On March 15th Microsoft Threat Intelligence, which monitors Ukrainian networks, warned that the GRU was \u201cpreparing for a renewed destructive campaign\u201d, including reconnaissance against important targets. Its deployment of \u201cwiper\u201d malware, which destroys data, was \u201creminiscent of the early days of the invasion\u201d. Between January and mid-February hackers working for all three main Russian intelligence services tried to penetrate government and military targets in 17 European countries, paving the way for either espionage or disruption\u2014access to a network allows both. \nRussian cyber-doctrine also puts a premium on information warfare. In November a website began publishing private messages from two senior officials in Moldova\u2014a classic \u201chack-and-leak\u201d operation akin to the one the GRU conducted ahead of America\u2019s presidential elections in 2016. On March 10th the White House publicly accused Russia of trying to foment a coup in Moldova. Recent Russian propaganda has also spread false claims that Ukrainian refugees abroad were being extradited and conscripted into Ukraine\u2019s army.\nRussia\u2019s army is exhausting itself in crude and costly ground assaults across eastern Ukraine. It has little offensive potential left. But it is easier to execute cyber-attacks than raise new battalions.\nSome sophisticated operations are only just coming to light: Microsoft recently revealed that Russia had been using a \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerability\u2014one that is previously unknown and thus impossible to patch\u2014for over a year until it was disclosed in mid-March. The vulnerability was used not just against Ukraine, but also government, military, energy and logistics sectors in Poland, Romania and Turkey. \u201cEuropean energy security and logistics are in the cross-hairs,\u201d warns Mr Black, \u201cand these priorities aren\u2019t fading away.\u201d\nUkraine needs continuous cyber-aid as much as a steady supply of shells. On February 22nd Dutch spy agencies warned that Ukraine\u2019s staunch defence could \u201cprobably only be sustained as long as Western support remains as intensive and adaptive as the cyber-operations of the Russian intelligence services.\u201d Mr Black agrees. \u201cThe reality is that the war is not over,\u201d he writes. \u201cInteractions between offence and defence could still change as Russia continues to learn from its early shortcomings.\u201d \u25a0\nCurious about the world?
