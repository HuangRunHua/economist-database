By Oliver Soden. Weidenfeld & Nicolson; 656 pages; \u00a330\nNoel Coward made his acting debut on the London stage in 1911 at the tender age of 11. The production\u2014an underwater-themed Edwardian fantasia\u2014was not auspicious. The young actor\u2019s doltish lines included \u201cCrumbs, how exciting!\u201d All the same, he tried to play the minor part of court jester with such conviction that everyone in the theatre might recognise his talent. He already seemed set on a starring role. Asked once what he wanted to be when he grew up, he replied, with great seriousness, \u201ca success\u201d.\n\u201cMasquerade\u201d, a new biography of Coward by Oliver Soden, reveals how a precocious child actor from a working-class family became the highest-paid writer in 20th-century Britain. Through playwriting, singing, acting, directing and composing\u2014there were few art forms in which he did not excel during his six-decade career\u2014Coward was at one time earning \u00a350,000 a year (around \u00a32.4m today). He revelled in the nickname \u201cthe Master\u201d.\nA trip to Broadway in 1921, where he was electrified by the dialogue, turned him on to playwriting. In notebooks he recorded the bons mots he overheard on his travels and began to fashion sharp, sardonic dialogue of his own. His lines come alive on stage. During a revival in 1964 of the play \u201cHay Fever\u201d, Maggie Smith brought the house down simply by flicking her wrist, arching an eyebrow and drawling: \u201cThis haddock\u2019s disgusting.\u201d \nFor audiences in the 1920s, recovering from the first world war, Coward\u2019s early plays were a tonic. \u201cHay Fever\u201d and \u201cThe Vortex\u201d delight in the magnificent wordplay, inconsequential yet entertaining, between eccentric old aristocrats and a younger generation brought up on alcohol, drugs and jazz. These plays were Coward\u2019s way of sending up the decadence and destruction of the Roaring Twenties, when it was a virtue to be flippant and fun even in the face of tumult. As one character says in \u201cPrivate Lives\u201d, Coward\u2019s hit play of 1930, you had to \u201claugh at everything\u201d.\nCritics often dismissed his comedies as light and unintellectual, but so long as they were doing well at the box office, Coward\u2019s main concern was the accumulation of property. Goldenhurst, an Elizabethan farmhouse in Kent, was his largest and most lavish purchase. He used the fortune he made in the West End and on Broadway to transform it into a plush estate enjoyed by his mother, Violet, to whom he felt indebted for his success.\nMale lovers came and went, but he clung to a group of friends with lives as glamorous as his own. Gladys Calthrop designed the costumes for many of his plays; the composers Ivor Novello and Cole Porter were among his closest pals. Perhaps no one was more devoted to Coward than Cole Lesley. First employed as his valet in 1936, Lesley managed to weather Coward\u2019s vicious moods and bleak depressions for more than 35 years.\nWhen the second world war erupted, it unleashed in the writer a burst of nationalism which, in Mr Soden\u2019s account, made him snobbish and petulant. Through his friendship with Winston Churchill, and in spite of his lack of experience or training, Coward managed to bag a top job in the Secret Service. The Nazis put him on their list of British residents who were to be arrested\u2014and presumably executed\u2014in the event of a German victory. But this employment was abruptly terminated, in part due to growing impatience with Coward\u2019s flamboyant lifestyle. The success of his play \u201cBlithe Spirit\u201d (1941), performed as bombs whistled overhead, did not lessen his resentment. He sent a flurry of peevish letters to Whitehall.\nWith age, Coward became embittered about post-war Britain. To avoid paying tax, he decamped to his seven-acre estate on the Jamaican coast, where he painted landscapes and reminisced about the empire with guests including Churchill and Ian Fleming. His views on the new welfare state and Indian independence were stubbornly reactionary.\nYet old age also emboldened his defence of homosexuality. Using recent archival discoveries, Mr Soden highlights Coward\u2019s opposition to its criminalisation, which he called \u201cstupid and quite barbarous\u201d. An unpublished letter reveals that in 1960 he planned a daring but unfinished play about a male love triangle; later he drafted several scenes for a play confronting the deep-rooted nature of homophobia. Had either been produced, it would have made history as the first depiction of homosexual desire on a British stage.\nThese days his plays are often regarded as frivolous and outdated. Mr Soden finds in them a seriousness that their original audiences failed to see\u2014and that even Coward, guarding his reputation as a light entertainer, may have preferred to gloss over. Return to his work after reading Mr Soden\u2019s illuminating biography, and it is striking how often his sparkling wit seems shadowed by despair. \u201cIs he happy, do you think? I mean really happy?\u201d someone asks of Garry Essendine, a character in \u201cPresent Laughter\u201d (written in 1939). Essendine, a thinly veiled self-portrait, responds with rare candour: \u201cThere\u2019s something awfully sad about happiness, isn\u2019t there?\u201d \u25a0\nCorrection (April 3rd 2023): In the original version of this piece we wrote that Noel Coward\u2019s salary of \u00a350,000 a year was equivalent to around \u00a315m today. This is incorrect. His salary would be worth around \u00a32.4m in today\u2019s money. This has been amended.
