First, you tell us that plenty of people \u201cin Britain\u2019s former colonies have long regarded the British Empire as racist and exploitative, even genocidal\u201d. Sure, but the subjects of British rule didn\u2019t all think the same thing. For example, Chinua Achebe, the African nationalist man of letters, refused to condemn British colonial rule shortly before he died in 2013.\nNext, your review was astonished that exhibit A in my case for the growing humanitarianism of the British Empire is \u201cthe slave trade\u201d. Of course, my prime exhibit is the fact that Britain was among the first states in the world\u2019s history to abolish the trade and slavery itself. You then emphasise the role of slave rebellions in bringing about abolition. I acknowledge that on page 56. But until you can present a cogent argument that the humanitarian revolution in British mores, which gathered steam decades before the 1791 slave-revolt in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), did not play a leading role in securing abolitionist victories in Britain\u2019s Parliament in 1807 and 1833, my case stands. \nCorrectly, you point out that \u201cin some analyses\u201d Britain\u2019s subsequent investment in suppressing slavery worldwide was intended to stop slaveholding economies undercutting British exporters, now reliant on free labour. But human actions usually spring from several motives and sometimes genuinely humanitarian motives really do dominate economic ones. You also claim that I argue that the empire was not \u201cwantonly violent\u201d. That is untrue: I admit it was\u2014sometimes. \nFinally, you find \u201clazy and banal\u201d my point that the empire was like any long-standing state in harbouring evils and injustices. But that was merely the elementary stage in the larger argument, clearly stated in the Conclusion, which you overlooked. That concludes that the British Empire wasn\u2019t \u201cessentially\u201d racist and murderous and that it contained growing humanitarian and liberal elements, which found climactic expression when, between May 1940 and June 1941, the empire stood alone (with Greece) as the only military opposition to the massively murderous racist regime in Nazi Berlin.\nNigel Biggar\nOxford\n\nPaying people to plant trees\nThe notion of paying the owners of rainforests not to destroy them (\u201cCash for climate services\u201d, March 4th) brought to mind the late, great Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmentalist. It was while visiting some of Kenya\u2019s poorest areas that Maathai saw how environmental degradation had affected the lives of rural women. In 1977 she founded the Green Belt Movement. Women were brought together to plant seeds, store rainwater, reduce soil erosion and provide food. For each tree planted, they would earn a small allowance. By 2004, the year Maathai became the first African woman to win the Nobel peace prize, the movement had planted more than 30m trees. It shows that empowering a community can achieve a lot. And also that payments for climate services works. \nMburu Gatonye\nNairobi\nTaiwan\u2019s energy problem\nAnother issue that vexes those who want to see Taiwan thrive is its energy policy (Special report on Taiwan, March 11th). The island has rushed headlong towards adopting natural gas to power its electricity grid, spurning coal and nuclear power. For all its economic advantages, natural gas presents grave risks to Taiwan because of the country\u2019s precarious geopolitical status. All of its natural-gas supply is carried by tankers that dock at two terminals on its exposed west coast. A third terminal is due to be completed by 2025. A fourth location is under discussion; fulfilling Taiwan\u2019s electricity-generation needs would require that fourth terminal, and possibly a fifth.\nNatural gas is dependent on just-in-time delivery, exacerbating the island\u2019s vulnerability to a blockade that many military experts now consider to be China\u2019s most probable method to subdue Taiwan. Whereas coal and nuclear enable about 18 months of on-site storage, Taiwan can hold just two weeks\u2019 worth of natural gas without a huge commitment to build more infrastructure. Reducing coal reflects important environmental concerns, but the elimination of nuclear power from Taiwan\u2019s mix  is a dangerous misstep.\nJordan McGillis\nPolicy analyst\nManhattan Institute\nNew York\n\nYou mentioned a lack of will in Taiwan to defend the island. Some historical background may explain this equivocal attitude. The people of Taiwan have been forced to identify with different nationalities over the past two centuries. As a colony of Japan from 1895 to 1945 the Taiwanese were coerced into identifying as Japanese. Then came the Chinese nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek, who, defeated by the Chinese Communists, ruled Taiwan under martial law for nearly four decades. During this time the Taiwanese had to learn a new language, Mandarin, and identify as Chinese. Only after the lifting of martial law in 1987 did the idea of a Taiwanese identity start to circulate, and it took time to be adopted. \nThe formal name of the country is still the Republic of China and its Olympic team is represented as Chinese Taipei, names that the global powers support in order to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Fewer and fewer countries formally recognise Taiwan each year. Given all this it is hard for the Taiwanese to be optimistic about their collective destiny. They feel powerless about sustaining their national identity in an acquiescent world. \nDenis Wu\nWeston, Massachusetts\n\nJapan and South Korea\nWhen I was first posted to Seoul in 1975 diplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan were only ten years old, and were at best bumpy. Now, after decades of continued bumpiness, the decision by South Korea to seek a positive, forward-looking relationship with Japan should be applauded (\u201cLitigating history\u201d, March 11th). There is so much the two neighbours have in common, and so much they can achieve by closely working together, not just for mutual benefit but for the region and beyond, especially on foreign- and security-policy issues with North Korea and China in mind. It is understandable that some South Koreans may be upset, but it is to be hoped that they will accept that although the past is important, it should not be allowed to shape the relationship between two such successful and important countries in a changed world. \nWarwick Morris\nBritish ambassador to South Korea, 2003 to 2008\nLangton Green, Kent\n\nBritain\u2019s nutty megaprojects\nBartleby put his finger on the key problem with megaprojects: we never learn from past mistakes and let politics trump prudence (March 18th). The prototype of all modern megaprojects in Britain was the groundnut scheme. It was launched in 1947 by Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government to transform African agriculture and solve Britain\u2019s post-war shortage of oils and fats by developing a 3m-acre fully mechanised peanut farm in the middle of what is now Tanzania. It failed so spectacularly that it helped bring down the Labour government in 1951. It cost \u00a336m (equivalent to \u00a31bn today) and imported more groundnuts as seed than it ever exported.\nHaste, hubris, political deadlines and ignoring the experts all played their part. But these lessons were swiftly forgotten, and so we have suffered one groundnut scheme after another since then. The HS2 high-speed rail project is merely the latest in a sadly long line.\nNicholas Westcott\nProfessor of practice in diplomacy\nSchool of Oriental and African Studies, University of London\n\nLiving underground\nThe idea of using caves on the Moon as viable living spaces is not new (\u201cLunar living\u201d, March 18th). Robert Heinlein\u2019s science-fiction novel  \u201cThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress\u201d, published in 1966, describes a lunar colony based in pressurised subterranean caves. As suggested in your article, the caves provided protection from solar radiation as well as allowing access to whatever resources might be available.\nRobert Checchio\nDunellen, New Jersey\n\nFor the sake of five\nIsrael\u2019s constitutional crisis (\u201cWill Bibi break Israel?\u201d, March 18th) could be resolved by taking a lesson from the biblical story of Sodom. Abraham gets God to agree that the presence of just ten righteous people would be enough to save the entire city. In Israel today, if just five Likud members of the Knesset were to break away from the governing coalition they could end Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s march towards undemocratic judicial reform. \nThe biblical story ends with the destruction of Sodom, implying that not even ten righteous people could be found. Time will tell if the Likud has five righteous members willing to challenge the prevailing powers, just as Abraham once did.\nPaul Greenberg\nBrookline, Massachusetts", "about": {"public": null,

First, you tell us that plenty of people \u201cin Britain\u2019s former colonies have long regarded the British Empire as racist and exploitative, even genocidal\u201d. Sure, but the subjects of British rule didn\u2019t all think the same thing. For example, Chinua Achebe, the African nationalist man of letters, refused to condemn British colonial rule shortly before he died in 2013.\nNext, your review was astonished that exhibit A in my case for the growing humanitarianism of the British Empire is \u201cthe slave trade\u201d. Of course, my prime exhibit is the fact that Britain was among the first states in the world\u2019s history to abolish the trade and slavery itself. You then emphasise the role of slave rebellions in bringing about abolition. I acknowledge that on page 56. But until you can present a cogent argument that the humanitarian revolution in British mores, which gathered steam decades before the 1791 slave-revolt in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), did not play a leading role in securing abolitionist victories in Britain\u2019s Parliament in 1807 and 1833, my case stands. \nCorrectly, you point out that \u201cin some analyses\u201d Britain\u2019s subsequent investment in suppressing slavery worldwide was intended to stop slaveholding economies undercutting British exporters, now reliant on free labour. But human actions usually spring from several motives and sometimes genuinely humanitarian motives really do dominate economic ones. You also claim that I argue that the empire was not \u201cwantonly violent\u201d. That is untrue: I admit it was\u2014sometimes. \nFinally, you find \u201clazy and banal\u201d my point that the empire was like any long-standing state in harbouring evils and injustices. But that was merely the elementary stage in the larger argument, clearly stated in the Conclusion, which you overlooked. That concludes that the British Empire wasn\u2019t \u201cessentially\u201d racist and murderous and that it contained growing humanitarian and liberal elements, which found climactic expression when, between May 1940 and June 1941, the empire stood alone (with Greece) as the only military opposition to the massively murderous racist regime in Nazi Berlin.\nNigel Biggar\nOxford\n\nPaying people to plant trees\nThe notion of paying the owners of rainforests not to destroy them (\u201cCash for climate services\u201d, March 4th) brought to mind the late, great Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmentalist. It was while visiting some of Kenya\u2019s poorest areas that Maathai saw how environmental degradation had affected the lives of rural women. In 1977 she founded the Green Belt Movement. Women were brought together to plant seeds, store rainwater, reduce soil erosion and provide food. For each tree planted, they would earn a small allowance. By 2004, the year Maathai became the first African woman to win the Nobel peace prize, the movement had planted more than 30m trees. It shows that empowering a community can achieve a lot. And also that payments for climate services works. \nMburu Gatonye\nNairobi\nTaiwan\u2019s energy problem\nAnother issue that vexes those who want to see Taiwan thrive is its energy policy (Special report on Taiwan, March 11th). The island has rushed headlong towards adopting natural gas to power its electricity grid, spurning coal and nuclear power. For all its economic advantages, natural gas presents grave risks to Taiwan because of the country\u2019s precarious geopolitical status. All of its natural-gas supply is carried by tankers that dock at two terminals on its exposed west coast. A third terminal is due to be completed by 2025. A fourth location is under discussion; fulfilling Taiwan\u2019s electricity-generation needs would require that fourth terminal, and possibly a fifth.\nNatural gas is dependent on just-in-time delivery, exacerbating the island\u2019s vulnerability to a blockade that many military experts now consider to be China\u2019s most probable method to subdue Taiwan. Whereas coal and nuclear enable about 18 months of on-site storage, Taiwan can hold just two weeks\u2019 worth of natural gas without a huge commitment to build more infrastructure. Reducing coal reflects important environmental concerns, but the elimination of nuclear power from Taiwan\u2019s mix  is a dangerous misstep.\nJordan McGillis\nPolicy analyst\nManhattan Institute\nNew York\n\nYou mentioned a lack of will in Taiwan to defend the island. Some historical background may explain this equivocal attitude. The people of Taiwan have been forced to identify with different nationalities over the past two centuries. As a colony of Japan from 1895 to 1945 the Taiwanese were coerced into identifying as Japanese. Then came the Chinese nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek, who, defeated by the Chinese Communists, ruled Taiwan under martial law for nearly four decades. During this time the Taiwanese had to learn a new language, Mandarin, and identify as Chinese. Only after the lifting of martial law in 1987 did the idea of a Taiwanese identity start to circulate, and it took time to be adopted. \nThe formal name of the country is still the Republic of China and its Olympic team is represented as Chinese Taipei, names that the global powers support in order to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Fewer and fewer countries formally recognise Taiwan each year. Given all this it is hard for the Taiwanese to be optimistic about their collective destiny. They feel powerless about sustaining their national identity in an acquiescent world. \nDenis Wu\nWeston, Massachusetts\n\nJapan and South Korea\nWhen I was first posted to Seoul in 1975 diplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan were only ten years old, and were at best bumpy. Now, after decades of continued bumpiness, the decision by South Korea to seek a positive, forward-looking relationship with Japan should be applauded (\u201cLitigating history\u201d, March 11th). There is so much the two neighbours have in common, and so much they can achieve by closely working together, not just for mutual benefit but for the region and beyond, especially on foreign- and security-policy issues with North Korea and China in mind. It is understandable that some South Koreans may be upset, but it is to be hoped that they will accept that although the past is important, it should not be allowed to shape the relationship between two such successful and important countries in a changed world. \nWarwick Morris\nBritish ambassador to South Korea, 2003 to 2008\nLangton Green, Kent\n\nBritain\u2019s nutty megaprojects\nBartleby put his finger on the key problem with megaprojects: we never learn from past mistakes and let politics trump prudence (March 18th). The prototype of all modern megaprojects in Britain was the groundnut scheme. It was launched in 1947 by Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government to transform African agriculture and solve Britain\u2019s post-war shortage of oils and fats by developing a 3m-acre fully mechanised peanut farm in the middle of what is now Tanzania. It failed so spectacularly that it helped bring down the Labour government in 1951. It cost \u00a336m (equivalent to \u00a31bn today) and imported more groundnuts as seed than it ever exported.\nHaste, hubris, political deadlines and ignoring the experts all played their part. But these lessons were swiftly forgotten, and so we have suffered one groundnut scheme after another since then. The HS2 high-speed rail project is merely the latest in a sadly long line.\nNicholas Westcott\nProfessor of practice in diplomacy\nSchool of Oriental and African Studies, University of London\n\nLiving underground\nThe idea of using caves on the Moon as viable living spaces is not new (\u201cLunar living\u201d, March 18th). Robert Heinlein\u2019s science-fiction novel  \u201cThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress\u201d, published in 1966, describes a lunar colony based in pressurised subterranean caves. As suggested in your article, the caves provided protection from solar radiation as well as allowing access to whatever resources might be available.\nRobert Checchio\nDunellen, New Jersey\n\nFor the sake of five\nIsrael\u2019s constitutional crisis (\u201cWill Bibi break Israel?\u201d, March 18th) could be resolved by taking a lesson from the biblical story of Sodom. Abraham gets God to agree that the presence of just ten righteous people would be enough to save the entire city. In Israel today, if just five Likud members of the Knesset were to break away from the governing coalition they could end Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s march towards undemocratic judicial reform. \nThe biblical story ends with the destruction of Sodom, implying that not even ten righteous people could be found. Time will tell if the Likud has five righteous members willing to challenge the prevailing powers, just as Abraham once did.\nPaul Greenberg\nBrookline, Massachusetts", "description": "A selection of correspondence", "ogDescription": "A selection of correspondence", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230304_CUP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-03-30T12:54:00Z", "dateModified": "2023-03-31T09:37:49Z", "dateCreated": "2023-03-30T10:28:45Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-04-01T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/sdhh7e8e8d37r8v4h00stq94kr420lqr", "publication": [{"id": "/content/k1kuc99ne0kne7189d5v593ok8legigq", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/jjblv8t0vllq51ljfc10eao4u30deuq4", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3lglvi8bkgv5v46trgk6jt5chbjpjou1", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/9851ukmbv4t5q1t5d9sq775c322c055h", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/jl4jv3m62kmla1d1jhs3h9pffmdhu262", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/61q6r92hm8cvarou02ec6atcjvo72q9b", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/8ghtv8mqtgqku25htkov289vo5d6ous5", "context": {"position": 300.1, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Letters to the editor", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/letters/2023/03/30/letters-to-the-editor", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
