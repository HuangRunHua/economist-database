The Economist has occasionally run hoax stories on this date, when readers should be on their guard against humorous mistruths.\nIt has been known for some time that plants can talk to one another. Many communicate chemically, both through the air and via their roots\u2014warning each other, for example, of the arrival of herbivorous insects in order to co-ordinate their responses to these pests. Those responses are also often a form of communication, namely a further release of chemicals that recruit predators and parasites of said herbivores. These then solve their summoners\u2019 problems by having lunch. \nPlants\u2019 interactions with sound are less well understood, though it is known that flowers such as evening primroses can detect the buzzing of bees and respond by producing sweeter nectar. Moreover, a paper published in this week\u2019s Cell, by Lilach Hadany of Tel-Aviv University and her colleagues, describes how plants make noises when they are stressed by drought or physical damage. Dr Hadany and her team do not yet know whether other plants are listening, but suspect that they might be.\nNone of this is news, however, to Paolo Fril, CEO and chief scientist of the Gene Duplication Corporation (GeneDupe), a biotechnology firm in San Melito, California. Observing that gardeners and greenhouse owners, from Britain\u2019s new king, Charles III, downwards, often talk to their charges, and sometimes even play them music, he and his team have been investigating plants\u2019 aural and oral activities for several years, and are now tweaking them using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. \nThe plan is to create a range of products which Dr Fril hopes will please his firm\u2019s shareholders\u2014which he needs to do after an awkward run-in the company had a few years ago with some animal-rights activists over its previous product, Print-a-pet. Fortunately for Dr Fril, the plant-welfare lobby is not nearly as large and noisy as its animal counterpart.\nThe obvious place for this new endeavour to start was with the ears of cereal crops. Though not ears in the conventional sense of the word, GeneDupe\u2019s biotechnologists realised that they could be turned into such. Each of the spikes attached to the seeds in an ear of barley, wheat or rye has a resonant frequency that depends, like the note plucked from a harp string, on its length. If those lengths can be varied precisely from seed to seed by appropriate gene editing, such an \u201cear\u201d can be made into a real ear, with every spike responding to its own, unique, resonant frequency in a manner similar to the hair cells in the mammalian version of that organ. \nDr Fril started with barley, which has the longest spikes of the three, and therefore the most potential for fine tuning. (He also likes a glass of beer.) Besides tweaking the spike lengths, his team installed in their modified barley plants versions of the buzz-detecting and nectar-generating genes from evening primroses. Together with a few other genetic rearrangements, the consequent redirection of nutrients (for wind-pollinated crops like barley produce no nectar, meaning the nutrients involved are available for other purposes) means that GeneDupe\u2019s Fortissimo barley grows faster than the normal variety if it is played appropriate sounds.\nThe first generation of Fortissimo barley had not involved too much tinkering with the original genetics, so it was to the buzzing of bees that it responded. However, barley\u2019s wind pollination means bees do not bother to visit it. It was therefore necessary to play the sound of bees across the experimental field through a speaker stack, which resulted in numerous complaints from the firm\u2019s neighbours.\nMusic to their ears\nApplying another of modern biotechnology\u2019s techniques, protein-folding software, did away with that problem. By predicting how protein chains will fold up, and thus what physical properties the resulting molecule will have, this software allows the design of novel genes that encode suites of proteins which respond appropriately but specifically to a wide range of sounds, from Beethoven to Beyonc\u00e9. That permits farmers to sow whichever variety of crop corresponds to their personal musical taste. \nThe prize activity of GeneDupe\u2019s newly created botanoacoustics division, however, is its work on the flip side of the matter\u2014sound generation by plants. The aim of this is to get crops to egg each other on to grow faster, with each plant broadcasting sounds that will stimulate the growth of those adjacent. That way there will be no need for loudspeakers, aggrieved neighbours or the inevitable arguments about which tracks crops like to listen to most. \nThis last point will in any case be settled in the next generation of Fortissimo crops, for GeneDupe\u2019s artificial-intelligence algorithms have developed versions of them that will both generate and respond to any pattern of sound programmed into their DNA, from Rabbie Burns\u2019s \u201cComing through the rye\u201d to that glorious, tub-thumping, harvest-festival hymn, \u201cThe valleys stand so thick with corn/That even they are singing\u201d. With this tweak, Dr Fril is pretty sure he will have a commercial success on his hands after its unveiling to an eager public on Saturday\u2014April 1st. \u25a0\nCurious about the world?
