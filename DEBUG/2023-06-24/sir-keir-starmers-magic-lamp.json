"https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/19/sir-keir-starmers-magic-lamp", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Monday June 19th was a typical day in British politics in so far as it involved a series of humiliations for the Conservative Party. mps approved a report on Boris Johnson condemning the former prime minister for lying to Parliament over lockdown-busting parties. Rishi Sunak skipped proceedings for a fortunately timed meeting with Sweden\u2019s prime minister. On the same day, the invite emerged for an illegal \u201cJingle and Mingle\u201d event at the party\u2019s headquarters during the Christmas lockdown of 2020. A video of the event had already circulated, with one staffer overheard saying it was fine \u201cas long as we don\u2019t stream that we\u2019re, like, bending the rules\u201d. Labour, through no efforts of their own, had their reputation comparatively enhanced. \nLuck is an overlooked part of politics. It is in the interests of both politicians and those who write about them to pretend it plays almost no role. Yet, as much as strategy or skill, luck determines success. \u201cFortune is the mistress of one half of our actions, and yet leaves the control of the other half, or a little less, to ourselves,\u201d wrote Machiavelli in \u201cThe Prince\u201d in the 16th century. Some polls give Labour a 20-point lead. Partly this is because, under Sir Keir Starmer, they have jettisoned the baggage of the Jeremy Corbyn-era and painted a picture of unthreatening economic diligence. Mainly it is because they are damned lucky. \nIf Sir Keir does have a magic lamp, it has been buffed to a blinding sheen. After all, it is not just the behaviour of Mr Johnson that helps Labour. Britain is suffering from a bout of economic pain in a way that particularly hurts middle-class mortgage-holders, who are crucial marginal voters. Even the timing helps. Rather than a single hit, the pain will be spread out until 2024, when the general election comes due. Each quarter next year about 350,000 households will remortgage and become, on average, almost \u00a33,000 ($3,830) per year worse off, says the Resolution Foundation. Labour strategists could barely dream of a more helpful backdrop. \nPolitical problems that once looked intractable for Labour have solved themselves. Scotland was supposed to be a Gordian knot. How could a unionist party such as Labour tempt left-wing voters of the nationalist Scottish National Party (snp)? The police have fixed that. Nicola Sturgeon, the most talented Scottish politician of her generation, found herself arrested and quizzed over an illicit \u00a3100,000 camper van and other matters to do with party funds. The snp\u2019s poll rating has collapsed and another 25 seats are set to fall into the Labour leader\u2019s lap thanks to PC McPlod and (at best) erratic book-keeping by the SNp. \nIt is not the first time police have come to Sir Keir\u2019s aid. He promised to quit in 2022 if police fined him for having a curry and beer with campaigners during lockdown-affected local elections in 2021. Labour\u2019s advisers were adamant no rules were broken. But police forces were erratic in dishing out penalties, veering between lax and draconian. It was a risk. Sir Keir gambled and won. \nLuck will always play a large role in a first-past-the-post system that generates big changes in electoral outcomes from small shifts in voting. Margins are often tiny. Mr Corbyn came, according to one very optimistic analysis, within 2,227 votes of scraping a majority in the 2017 election, if they had fallen in the right places. Likewise, in 2021, Labour faced a by-election in Batley and Spen, in Yorkshire. A defeat would almost certainly have led to a leadership challenge; Labour clung on, and so did Sir Keir. If he enters Downing Street in 2024, he will have 323 voters near Leeds to thank. \nSir Keir is hardly the first leader to benefit from Fortune\u2019s favour. Good ones have always needed it. Sir Tony Blair reshaped Labour and won three general elections. But he had the job only because John Smith, his predecessor, dropped dead at 55. (\u201cHe\u2019s fat, he\u2019s 53, he\u2019s had a heart attack and he\u2019s taking on a stress-loaded job,\u201d the Sun had previously written, with unkind foresight.) Without the Falklands war in 1982, Margaret Thatcher would have asked for re-election soon afterwards based on a few years of faltering experiments with monetarism. Formidable political talent is nothing without a dash of luck. \nOften the most consequential politicians are the luckiest. Nigel Farage has a good claim to be the most influential politician of the past 20 years. He should also be dead. The former leader of the UK Independence Party was run over in 1985. Then, in 1987, testicular cancer nearly killed him. In 2010, he survived a plane crash after a banner\u2014\u201cVote for your country\u2014Vote UKIP\u201d\u2014became tangled around the plane. Smaller factors also played in his favour: when he was a member of the European Parliament he was fortunately allocated a seat next to the European Commission president, providing a perfect backdrop for viral speeches. (\u201cThey handed me the internet on a plate!\u201d chortles Mr Farage.) Britain left the EU, in part, because Mr Farage is lucky. \nStop polishing that lamp, you\u2019ll go blind \nToo much good luck can be a bad thing. David Cameron gambled three times on referendums (on the country\u2019s voting system, on Scottish independence and on Brexit). He won two heavily and lost one narrowly. Two out of three ain\u2019t bad, but it is enough to condemn him as one of the worst prime ministers on record. \u201cA Prince who rests wholly on Fortune is ruined when she changes,\u201d wrote Machiavelli. It was right in 1516; it was right in 2016. Labour would do well to heed the lesson. It sometimes comes across as a party that expects the Conservatives to lose, rather than one thinking how best to win.\nFortune has left Labour in a commanding position. Arguments against a Labour majority rely on hope (perhaps inflation will drop) not expectation. Good luck may power Labour to victory, but it will not help them govern. The last time Labour replaced the Conservatives, in 1997, the economy was flying. Now, debt is over 100% of GDp. Growth prospects are lacking, while public services are failing. It will be a horrible time to run the country. Bad luck. \u25a0\nRead more from Bagehot, our columnist on British politics: \nReading the death certificate on Boris Johnson\u2019s political career (Jun 15th)\nBritish politics is littered with fake taboos (June 8th)\nBritain\u2019s new political sorcerer: the Reform Fairy (May 31st)\nAlso: How the Bagehot column got its name", "description": "Luck often trumps skill and strategy in British politics", "ogDescription": "Luck often trumps skill and strategy in British politics", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230624_BRD000.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-06-19T20:48:18Z", "dateModified": "2023-06-22T13:46:55Z", "dateCreated": "2023-06-19T20:48:03Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-06-24T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/2kpe9bbfpabplabl7jo493peedr0r0e3", "publication": [{"id": "/content/qkabpkufhvjuecehsigdv80dgtrq8ll6", "context": {"position": 1200.46, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/pn35enf2bqvnje18ro0so515mbt4dge4", "context": {"position": 480.46000000000004, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g3e1udr5nt09idpldiebr0eih02ns56v", "context": {"position": 1200.46, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ihgokq4bbqrrbb9dba3r973i2ngeo05t", "context": {"position": 1200.46, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/331k10rju8qbelhhalsgjs5h25q608u3", "context": {"position": 480.46000000000004, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ul92kg7c3mq3hnof33tih3nrmr041md0", "context": {"position": 450.46000000000004, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/aa35bm9jvsjud28rni1vmftgau95r56e", "context": {"position": 1200.46, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/s8ffsdm78avvrtieuvcn1m7nmgkgu9om", "context": {"position": 480.46000000000004, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Vaping among schoolchildren has become a moral panic in Britain", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/22/vaping-among-schoolchildren-has-become-a-moral-panic-in-britain", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2gvf7u1q7g328hkth8d8dlp0lmetqm6k", "publication": [{"id": "/content/qkabpkufhvjuecehsigdv80dgtrq8ll6", "context": {"position": 1200.42, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/pn35enf2bqvnje18ro0so515mbt4dge4", "context": {"position": 480.4200000000001, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/g3e1udr5nt09idpldiebr0eih02ns56v", "context": {"position": 1200.42, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ihgokq4bbqrrbb9dba3r973i2ngeo05t", "context": {"position": 1200.42, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/331k10rju8qbelhhalsgjs5h25q608u3", "context": {"position": 480.4200000000001, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ul92kg7c3mq3hnof33tih3nrmr041md0", "context": {"position": 450.4200000000001, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/aa35bm9jvsjud28rni1vmftgau95r56e", "context": {"position": 1200.42, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/s8ffsdm78avvrtieuvcn1m7nmgkgu9om", "context": {"position": 480.4200000000001, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Pay for bosses in Britain falls far behind America.
