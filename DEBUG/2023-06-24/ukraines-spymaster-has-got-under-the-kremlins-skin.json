"articleBody": "Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine war\n\nIT TAKES A certain amount of fear to paralyse seasoned military-intelligence officers. But a Russian attack on the officers\u2019 Rybalsky island headquarters in Kyiv in March 2022 crossed that threshold. The officers recall \u201cterror\u201d as missiles landed, windows popped and ramshackle buildings crumbled at the edges. The men, waiting in a reception area for a meeting with their boss, fell to the floor. Moments later a door beside them opened, and Major-General Kyrylo Budanov stepped out. \u201cEverything is fine,\u201d one recalls him grunting, before he ordered them to get back to work. \u201cHe dusted himself off, put his cap on and went outside to inspect the damage.\u201d \nThe 37-year-old General Budanov, a former commando, is Ukraine\u2019s youngest-ever spymaster. As the architect of increasingly brazen operations within Russia, he is also a big irritant for the Kremlin. Aides say there have been \u201cat least ten\u201d attempts on his life. In the latest, on May 29th, missiles and drones targeted his Rybalsky office. They narrowly missed that and an adjacent road bridge, although drones scraped another building. A day later Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, bragged about a \u201cprecision\u201d attack destroying the complex. Pro-Kremlin media reported that General Budanov had been evacuated to Germany and put into a coma. The Economist can confirm that neither claim is true.\nThe spymaster\u2019s office, his undisguised address for 16 months, exudes chaotic, crepuscular energy. Sandbags block windows. Machine-guns and armour litter the floor. A turntable sits in the corner, though the audible Vivaldi comes from a YouTube playlist. The sense of absurdity is heightened by an elderly frog, swimming about a tank, and a canary. Memorabilia from General Budanov\u2019s war line the wall. In an adjacent corridor hangs a photo of a March cross-border raid into Bryansk in Russia, supposedly the work of independent Russian partisans. A large screen, the room\u2019s only source of light, displays a map of Moscow\u2014the target of a drone strike in May. \n\nUkraine has not claimed either operation. But General Budanov barely respects the official ambiguity. \u201cWe are at war,\u201d he says. \u201cDrones over the Kremlin showed the world that Russian defences are just a Potemkin village.\u201d\nAides huddle close when the general speaks. Under his leadership, Ukraine\u2019s main directorate of intelligence\u2014HUR\u2014has become a plucky, autonomous authority that punches above its weight. It resembles a gang. \u201cBefore we had managers, now we have a leader,\u201d says one veteran officer. Oleg, an operative who has known General Budanov for decades, speaks approvingly of his ability to infect others with his fervour, comparing him to a snake \u201chypnotising you before he comes in for the kill. Restrained, measured, never panicked. You do anything he asks.\u201d \nGeneral Budanov has his adversaries at home as well as abroad. Competing security agencies fret about his power and resources. \u201cIt\u2019s logical that military intelligence becomes powerful during war,\u201d says one rival officer. \u201cBut you can\u2019t get much done without his sign-off now.\u201d Even friends describe the military-intelligence chief as \u201cdifficult\u201d. Some find it hard to get on with him, says Brigadier-General Dmytro Timkov, a partner on \u201cdozens\u201d of operations. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t adapt to others\u2019 opinions.\u201d The younger Budanov would answer back to commanders if he thought them wrong. Yet supporters say he has a \u201cgenerous\u201d side, too. A master of mind games in the outside world, says Oleg, General Budanov never extended that to colleagues. \u201cHe understands you can\u2019t trick tricksters.\u201d\nWho could it have been?\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky\u2019s decision in 2020 to promote a little-known commander came as a surprise to many. But inside the services Kyrylo Budanov\u2019s name was already legendary. The Kremlin knew something about him, too. \u201cIt was the equivalent of holding a red flag to them,\u201d says Andrii Yusov, an HUR officer. \u201cIt\u2019s what convinced many of us of [President] Zelensky\u2019s national-security credentials.\u201d \nThe new spymaster was revered for leading a daring raid, in 2016, to destroy helicopters at Dzhankoi air base in Russian-occupied Crimea. The geography of the operation\u2014in the backyard of Russia\u2019s security services\u2014was brazen enough. On the way out General Budanov\u2019s team also engaged Russian special forces, killing several, including a high-ranking commander. The Russians later avenged that raid with attacks of their own, missing General Budanov but killing his superior. \nGeneral Timkov, reputed to be the second-in-command on that raid, chortles through an unconvincing denial of the operation. But he offers another story that only adds to the legend. In early 2015, he says, the two were deep inside enemy lines in Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, when the then Lieutenant-Colonel Budanov was hit by an anti-infantry mine. Shrapnel sunk into his neck and shoulder-blade, and just below his heart. \u201cKyrylo asked us to leave him.\u201d The group refused, and through force of willpower the wounded officer stumbled to safety more than 3km away. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything the whole way. That\u2019s how much it hurt.\u201d\nGeneral Budanov made his real mark after the 2022 invasion. In the early days, as saboteurs operated in Kyiv, the general was seen running about Rybalsky with a machine-gun. He masterminded critical operations at Hostomel airport, Irpin and Moschun, on the edge of Kyiv, which stopped the Russian advance\u2014if only just. He sent supply-and-rescue helicopters into the cauldron of besieged Mariupol. He took part in many front-line operations himself. The risk-taking worried some colleagues, who felt their leader should be better protected\u2014\u201cbut you try stopping him.\u201d The general says he does it only because other people are in danger. \u201cLives are at stake. There is no room for mistakes.\u201d \nWestern partners describe the Ukrainian spymaster as a straightforward and incorruptible player. He is now privy to more American and British intelligence than the Germans or French, says Philip Ingram, a former British military-intelligence colonel. Yet his bravado is not universally welcomed. Leaked documents show that the CIA had to intervene to stop General Budanov from ordering an attack on Moscow on the anniversary of the invasion in February. Sabotage and the raids inside Russia since have heightened worries among Ukraine\u2019s allies about provoking a nuclear power. General Budanov\u2019s statements about engineering a collapse of Russia do the same. \nYet he says that nine years of studying Russian aggression leave him uniquely positioned to assess the risks of nuclear escalation. \u201cAs the head of intelligence, I\u2019m telling you straight out\u2014it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cFor all my dislike of the Russian Federation, there are not many idiots running the country.\u201d He insists that peace is impossible without the strategic defeat of Russia\u2014and the \u201creformatting of power\u201d there. \u201cEither everyone will get out of the war at the same time, or one side will lose and the other side will win. There are no other options.\u201d  \nAs a confidant of the president\u2014those in government call them kindred spirits\u2014General Budanov is understood to be playing an ever-bigger role in behind-the-scenes peace negotiations. Sources say he is a conduit to secret talks with the Chinese, and he has also been in contact with Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Russia\u2019s mercenary Wagner outfit.\nIn conversation it is clear that General Budanov has been thinking hard about post-war Ukraine. Last winter there was talk of him becoming defence minister. He insists his only ambition is victory. Yet secret polls conducted by Mr Zelensky\u2019s office show they are thinking about using the cult of their hero spymaster to counterbalance a perceived rivalry emanating from Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s likeable and independent commander-in-chief. General Budanov\u2019s colleagues say they are convinced he is destined for a big political role once peace comes\u2014if he lives that long. \u25a0", "description": "Kyrylo Budanov is much hunted,
