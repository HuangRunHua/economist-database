reckoning", "section": "Culture", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/06/22/a-tv-drama-about-taiwanese-politics-has-sparked-a-social-reckoning", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "The clock is ticking down to presidential elections in Taiwan. Functionaries in the two main parties frantically smear the rival candidate and scramble to shape the image of their own, hiring influencers, coining catchy slogans and framing touching moments with voters on the street. But there is one key difference between the universe of \u201cWave Makers\u201d, a hit political drama that came out on Netflix in April, and Taiwanese reality: in the series, the China question, usually the fulcrum of the island\u2019s politics, does not exist.\nThis conceit means that the focus is on domestic issues rather than grand matters of national identity or the threat of invasion. Drawing on deep research and interviews, the show zooms in on the sacrifices women are asked to make for supposedly important causes. It tells a hopeful story of one character standing up for another\u2014and, in a feedback loop between life and art, it has inspired real women in Taiwan to stand up for themselves.\nThe fictional election is a vehicle to examine thorny questions of politics and morality. How much should people be willing to give up for the sake of a wider goal? Where is the line between pragmatic compromise and hypocrisy? All the characters wrestle with clashes between their political mission and personal ideals. The liberal presidential nominee is against the death penalty, but dare not say so in public. A young campaigner is castigated as a sell-out by his friends for missing protests because he was busy making party-propaganda videos. His well-worn riposte is that power, not protests, brings about change.\nThe compromises that have most stirred Taiwanese viewers are those demanded of the two main characters. Played subtly by Hsieh Ying-xuan (pictured left), Weng Wen-fang is the lesbian daughter of an influential elder in the liberal party. She loses a local election after a public spat with one of her father\u2019s conservative friends, who insults her girlfriend. Weng\u2019s mother urges her to apologise. In politics, she says, you think of the \u201cbig picture\u201d and compromise. Weng refuses. The \u201cgreater good\u201d, she realises, is often just an excuse to cover up wrongdoing. \nWhen she discovers that a young member of the campaign team, Chang Ya-ching (Gingle Wang, pictured right), is being asked to \u201clet things go\u201d for the sake of the party\u2019s image, she insists that they fight back. Chang has fled from an affair with her former boss, a slick politician now running for vice-president with the right-wing party. He has a USB stick full of naked photos, which he uses to harass and control Chang and others. After Chang is molested by another man in her new job, Weng urges her to report it. But holding the assailant to account is tough: their party is nominally progressive, but its internal structures are stiff and patriarchal. Its female candidate for president asks them to hush things up.\nMuch of the plot was drawn from life. The two screenwriters of \u201cWave Makers\u201d, Chien Li-ying and Peng Wei-chao, a former campaigner who goes by the pen name Cynical Chick, spent two years interviewing political operatives. At first, says Ms Chien, they simply thought that Taiwan\u2019s election culture would be colourful material for a television series. Sexual harassment did not feature in their plans. But as they developed the characters, they realised that almost every woman they spoke with, in politics and other professions, had experienced it. Hardly any had reported it. \nThat mirrors wider evidence about gender relations in Taiwan. On the face of it, they are more equal than elsewhere in East Asia. A higher proportion of women sit in Taiwan\u2019s parliament than in others in the region, for example. But ossified norms and taboos have hindered reporting of harassment, says Chi Hui-jung, an activist who serves in the government\u2019s supervisory body: \u201cGirls are taught to be very polite. You can\u2019t be bad-tempered. You can\u2019t complain.\u201d As a result, Taiwanese women who are abused convince themselves \u201cthat it\u2019s no big deal\u201d. A survey in 2021 found that 82% of women sexually harassed in the workplace did not make formal complaints. Nearly half of those who kept quiet had \u201cbrushed it off as a joke\u201d. \nTaken at the flood\n\u201cWave Makers\u201d has helped shatter the omert\u00e0. On May 31st a woman who once worked for Taiwan\u2019s ruling Democratic and Progressive Party declared: \u201cI\u2019m going to be my own Weng Wen-fang.\u201d In a Facebook post she recounted being sexually harassed at work and how she was encouraged not to report it.\nA cascade of #MeToo testimonies followed. Within a fortnight scores of allegations of sexual harassment were made against members of all the island\u2019s main political parties. The wave of accusations took in prominent academics, doctors, musicians, writers, artists, diplomats and exiled Chinese dissidents. \nOn June 2nd Ms Chien disclosed her own #MeToo experience. As a student, she said, she idolised a Chinese poet. She was flattered when, on a visit to Taiwan, he asked to meet her. Then, she alleges, he sexually assaulted her (he denies it). Ms Chien said nothing about the episode for years, even while writing \u201cWave Makers\u201d. The man was famous; she felt she was a nobody. But the surge of denunciations in the show\u2019s wake\u2014and the overwhelming support for accusers in Taiwanese society\u2014encouraged her to tell her story, too.\nIn the past, Ms Chien says, it was especially hard for women to speak up if an offence occurred in an organisation meant to serve a noble cause, whether that was artistic, political or the security of a place that sees itself as the idealised foil of a big bully: \u201cThey always make you think about the greater interest and swallow it.\u201d Today Taiwan is entering a real-life election season and faces a military threat from China. But high stakes don\u2019t justify silencing victims, Ms Chien insists\u2014and Taiwanese women are no longer willing to be treated like hostesses. \u201cWe are educated intellectuals, not the armrests for your sofa. Please remove your hand from my thigh.\u201d \nWitty and propulsive, \u201cWave Makers\u201d was the most-viewed show on Netflix Taiwan within two days of its release; it stayed in the top ten for five weeks. And it has sparked a social reckoning. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s president, has apologised for failing to prevent sexual harassment in her party and across society. The cabinet has promised to review the legal framework for such cases and to propose amendments in parliament this summer. The writers are not surprised by the torrent of allegations, but didn\u2019t expect their show to unleash it. \u201cEveryone must have been holding it in,\u201d says Ms Chien, \u201cuntil they couldn\u2019t.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter", "description": "The response to
