"Article", "articleBody": "\u201cEvil has become a heroic act,\u201d declared Dmitry Muratov, a courageous Russian journalist and a winner of the Nobel peace prize, in a recent speech in Bonn. Never again, he lamented, will Russians and Ukrainians \u201cbe fraternal nations\u201d. He was interrupted by the sound of air-raid sirens played by Ukrainian reporters on their phones. He did not complain: \u201cThe world needs to hear the sound of war.\u201d\nThese days many Ukrainians find it hard to listen to Russian voices, even those of dissidents. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, recently signed a law that restricts the printing of contemporary Russian books. A magnificent exception to this rupture is a production this year of Sergei Prokofiev\u2019s \u201cWar and Peace\u201d at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. Under a Russian director, Dmitri Tcherniakov, and conducted by Vladimir Jurowski, a Russian-born German citizen, Ukrainian, Moldovan and Russian singers are performing an opera based on Leo Tolstoy\u2019s saga of the Napoleonic wars. \nPart of what brings them together is Tolstoy\u2019s pacifism. The young writer who fought in Russia\u2019s wars in Crimea and the Caucasus evolved into an opponent of all forms of violence and repression and an inspiration to Gandhi. Applying the artistic and psychological mastery of his fiction to these radical ideas, he became a prophet of peace. He loathed war \u201cnot because he was afraid of death, but because of how war poisons the human soul and is inevitably steeped in lies and hatred\u201d, says Andrei Zorin, a biographer of Tolstoy at Oxford University. \nIn Munich, the hatred and lies are exposed on stage. Why, ask both Tolstoy and the production, do people travel far from home to kill total strangers? How do human beings become possessed by the rage of violence and war? These urgent questions, immortally formulated by an author who died over a century ago, loom over Russia\u2019s past, present and future. \n\u201cTolstoy is making a comeback. Now he is not only the brilliant author of \u2018War and Peace\u2019,\u201d declared InLiberty, an educational project in Russia, on the centenary of his death in 2010, \u201cbut also an ideologue of non-violence.\u201d Russians who considered themselves individuals rather than disempowered subjects of the state found in his writings an ideal version of nationhood that had yet to materialise in real life. As a 19th-century literary critic says in Tom Stoppard\u2019s \u201cCoast of Utopia\u201d, a trilogy of plays about Russian thinkers: \u201cIn Russia, there\u2019s no division of labour, literature has to do it all.\u201d In fact, \u201cliterature can replace, can actually become Russia!\u201d\nWhen Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine\u2014waging war to suppress independence and freethinking in both countries\u2014Russians who were ashamed and appalled armed themselves with Tolstoy\u2019s words. A man who held up a copy of \u201cWar and Peace\u201d in Red Square was promptly detained. The most quoted text was a searing essay Tolstoy wrote in 1904 in response to Russia\u2019s humiliating war against Japan, which he entitled \u201cBethink Yourselves!\u201d \u201cStupefied by prayers, sermons, exhortations,\u201d Tolstoy thundered, thousands of soldiers \u201cwill commit the most dreadful act of killing men whom they do not know and who have done them no harm.\u201d A man who posted these words online last year was charged with discrediting the Russian army.\nAlexei Navalny, Russia\u2019s imprisoned opposition leader, spoke Tolstoy\u2019s words in court: \u201cWar is a product of despotism. Those who want to fight war must only fight despotism.\u201d It was not the first time he had enlisted Tolstoy to his cause. In a film about Mr Putin\u2019s secret palace on the Black Sea, released on the day of Mr Navalny\u2019s arrest in 2021, he cited Tolstoy\u2019s image of Russia\u2019s rulers: \u201cThe villains have gathered. They have looted people, they have hired soldiers and judges to guard their orgy. And they are having a feast.\u201d\nThe villain-in-chief moved to neutralise Tolstoy and co-opt him for his own purposes. Less than a month before sending his forces into Ukraine, Mr Putin signed a decree. \u201cTaking into account the outstanding contribution of Leo Tolstoy to national and world culture,\u201d it read, \u201cI hereby resolve\u2026to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Tolstoy\u2019s birth in 2028.\u201d \nMr Putin was not the first Russian leader to lay claim to Tolstoy\u2019s legacy while trampling on his ideas. Nor was he the first to find that Tolstoy fiercely resisted.\nA crackpot and a mirror\n\u201cWhat happiness it was to live in the time of Tolstoy,\u201d wrote Konstanin Stanislavsky, a legendary theatre director, on the day Tolstoy died, \u201cand how scary it is to remain on this Earth without him.\u201d Lenin branded him a \u201ccrackpot\u201d for urging non-violent protest. But in power the Bolshevik leader, who had also called Tolstoy \u201cthe mirror of the Russian revolution\u201d, sought to nationalise him. In 1920 Lenin authorised the publication of Tolstoy\u2019s works in full.\nThe 90-volume project was launched in 1928\u2014the centenary of Tolstoy\u2019s birth and the beginning of Russia\u2019s descent into Stalin\u2019s totalitarianism. Statues of Tolstoy were erected and medallions minted. Yet even as Tolstoy was canonised, thousands of his disciples were arrested and murdered. Famine was inflicted on the peasantry, which he had striven to raise up. \nDuring the second world war, Stalin\u2019s regime ransacked \u201cWar and Peace\u201d for parallels between the struggle against the Nazis and Russia\u2019s defeat of Napoleon in 1812. On the day the Soviet Union was invaded, Vyacheslav Molotov, the foreign minister, declared: \u201cNapoleon\u2019s march into Russia was answered with a patriotic war, and Napoleon was defeated\u2026The Red Army and all our people will once again lead a victorious patriotic war for the fatherland, for honour and for freedom.\u201d \nBut the novel, like the author, fought back. As Pierre Bezukhov, one of its main characters, says: \u201cThey took me and shut me up. They hold me captive. What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha ha ha!\u201d \nSoviet citizens turned to the book of their own accord, seeing it as a reservoir of national unity and courage in a country where honour and freedom were suppressed. \u201cPeople avidly read \u2018War and Peace\u2019 as a means of testing their reactions (not Tolstoy\u2019s, because no one doubted he was equal to life\u2019s challenges),\u201d wrote Lidiya Ginzburg in \u201cBlockade Diary\u201d, a chronicle of the siege of Leningrad. \u201cThe reader would say to himself, \u2018Yes, now I know that my feelings are accurate\u2019.\u201d Leading actors read chapters of the story on the radio.\nProkofiev began composing his operatic version before the invasion. He was more interested in the lyrical \u201cpeace\u201d scenes than in the stylistic diktats of Socialist Realism. When war began he was advised to rethink the heroic aspects of the story and enhance the choral elements that could represent a unified mass rising against invaders. Prokofiev complied\u2014but never saw his opera fully staged. Stalin feared Soviet soldiers would return from the war with new ideas of freedom, like the Russian officers who triumphed in 1812. He barely celebrated victory and was quick to rebrand his wartime allies as enemies. \nIn 1948 Prokofiev, along with other great artists, was declared guilty of \u201cformalist perversions and anti-dramatic tendencies alien to the Soviet people\u201d. He died on March 5th 1953\u2014the same day as Stalin. The volume in the collected works that included Tolstoy\u2019s denunciation of the death penalty was belatedly printed in 1956. A few years later, as the defeat of Hitler came to replace the Bolshevik revolution as the country\u2019s unifying myth, the authorities dragooned Tolstoy into service once again, adapting \u201cWar and Peace\u201d into an epic film (see main image above). Thousands of Soviet soldiers appeared as extras. \nReturning in July as part of the Munich Opera Festival, the Bavarian production, too, was conceived before an invasion. But it opened a year into the war. It is set in the Hall of Columns in the House of Unions in Moscow, where Stalin\u2019s corpse lay in state. Instead of an overture, a quote from \u201cBethink Yourselves!\u201d is projected above the stage: \u201cAgain war. Again sufferings, necessary to nobody, utterly uncalled-for; again fraud, again the universal stupefaction and brutalisation of men.\u201d \nThe murderer\u2019s fallacy\nThe first sound is not music, but a despairing animal yelp that merges with Prokofiev\u2019s chords and emanates from Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, another of the story\u2019s characters (sung here by Andrey Zhilikhovsky, a Moldovan baritone). The atmosphere of war is present from curtain-up; peace is already a memory. Mattresses are strewn on the floor, as in a shelter for internally displaced people. \n Hero of the resistance\n\nYet if war is ever-present, the enemy is absent. The invasion does not come in the shape of French troops\u2014there are none\u2014but rather from within. It is not borders that are violated but the bounds of decency and the bonds of family and love.\nA vast chorus that emerges from the darkness at the start of the second act breathes war. Intoxicated with Prokofiev\u2019s music and by propaganda, the crowd whips itself into a patriotic frenzy, punching the air as if possessed. The \u201cfeverish, hot-headed, insane excitement which has now seized the idle upper ranks of Russian society\u201d, Tolstoy wrote in 1904, was a symptom of a guilty conscience. So were the mendacious vows of \u201creadiness to sacrifice life (or one should say other people\u2019s lives)\u201d, and promises to \u201cdefend with one\u2019s breast land which does not belong to one\u201d.\nThis insanity is a form of self-destruction. In the novel, Prince Andrei is wounded in battle. Here he puts a gun to his own chest and pulls the trigger. In one of the production\u2019s most moving scenes, which forms a climax in the novel, his sometime fianc\u00e9e Natasha Rostova, sung by the Ukrainian soprano Olga Kulchynska, tries to lift Andrei\u2019s bleeding body and lead him in a waltz. His limbs flop like a broken puppet\u2019s; she lowers him onto a mat, covers him with a blanket and lies beside him.\nJust as \u201cthe murderer who has begun to assassinate his victim cannot stop\u201d, wrote Tolstoy, so the Russian people imagine that \u201cthe fact of the deadly work having been commenced is an unanswerable argument in favour of war.\u201d The antidotes, he knew, were empathy, tenderness and love. \u25a0 \nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter", "description": "The
