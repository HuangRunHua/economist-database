generative artificial intelligence (ai) has been an outbreak of bipartisan focus, curiosity and deliberation in Washington, DC. Legislators and regulators are trying hard to come to grips with the protean technology. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has been holding senators-only briefings with experts to educate his chamber. In late June he called for \u201ca new and unique approach\u201d to writing legislation about AI, saying it was \u201cunlike anything Congress has dealt with before\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like labour or health care or defence where Congress has had a long history we can work off of,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many ways, we\u2019re starting from scratch.\u201d He has set up a steering group of two Republicans and two Democrats, including himself, and plans this autumn to supplement the normal committee process, or posturing, with \u201dAI Insight Forums\u201d, to include the industry\u2019s leaders and its critics, to do \u201cyears of work in a matter of months\u201d. \nIt is understandable that wise guys are making fun of this. Given Congress\u2019s reputation for speed and technological literacy (the Senate was in session for all of 14 days in June, and Mr Schumer uses a flip phone), the jokes write themselves, almost. ChatGPT\u2019s first, unfunny stab reflected the cynicism any sentient being might feel: \u201cWhy did the AI refuse to testify before Congress? Because it didn\u2019t want to be caught in a loop of lawmakers asking the same question over and over.\u201d\nYet Americans should bask in this rare season, while it lasts, of good-faith searching and head-scratching. Not only are the regulators interrogating themselves about where and how they should regulate, the industry itself is asking to be regulated, up to a point. Even if it is all doomed to end in partisan impasse and recrimination, now is the time to ask: how could Washington get this right? \nOne danger is that lawmakers could wind up bickering over a problem they can address only at the edges. Representatives of both parties regret not more aggressively regulating the internet in general and social media in particular. Being politicians, they are alert to how political actors are already using AI tools to generate political messages, including fabricated images. For their part journalists, being journalists, are obsessed with AI\u2019s potential to create and spread lies. \nThese are serious concerns. But because of America\u2019s speech protections, congressional action would probably be less constructive than voluntary standards by campaigns, technical approaches by the private sector to authenticate images and scepticism from a jaded electorate. The more Congress focuses on the flow of information, the more it will be riven by fights over whether a particular chatbot is inclined to disparage one party or another. \u201cIf we get drawn into refighting the social-media wars, we risk not realising the promise of machine learning,\u201d warns Kent Walker, the president of global affairs at Google and Alphabet. \u201cSocial media isn\u2019t going to cure cancer, but AI has the potential to, and it would be a shame if that promise were politicised. It would be a shame to hold back progress in nuclear fusion because we can\u2019t agree about Twitter.\u201d\nA better starting point would be to recognise that the government is already regulating AI. Years ago it set the nerve ends tingling of the federal bureaucracy, another complex, amorphous entity that somehow translates countless inputs into answers that cannot always be explained. Plenty of laws already cover the use of AI. And questions about AI\u2019s use in providing health care, hiring people, driving cars or investing are being asked and answered, albeit too slowly for some industries. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, part of the Commerce Department, has drawn up voluntary standards by which AI might be governed. \nChris Meserole of the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think-tank, says Congress could exploit this \u201cincredibly rare moment\u201d of bipartisan seriousness by mandating that each regulatory agency develop a plan to adapt the NIST standards to its sector. It could also mandate disclosure about the use of AI in products, and require transparency into algorithms used in high-risk systems. \u201cIf an autonomous vehicle using AI has an accident, we need to understand what went wrong,\u201d he says. \nTo walk humbly with Chuck Schumer\nCongress might also consider export controls for AI models and chips it deems too powerful. It could look at creating an agency to regulate big tech (disclosure: Lexington\u2019s brother, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, has proposed legislation to do so) or whether some other means might bolster the agencies\u2019 AI expertise. It could also help universities pay for the computing power they need to conduct AI research in the public interest. \nThe good news is that these are the sorts of measures that Congress and the Biden administration are weighing. The most striking word in Mr Schumer\u2019s recent speech was \u201chumility\u201d, as in, \u201cWe must exercise humility as we proceed.\u201d Like many of his colleagues, Mr Schumer is not celebrated for this quality. Nor are the technology companies, but, in the face of AI, they are embracing it, too. Mr Walker notes that AI researchers have spoken of the \u201cAI half-pipe of heaven and hell\u201d, meaning it tends to be treated as either wonderful or terrible. \u201cThere\u2019s very little market for, \u2018Well, AI has a lot of important pros and cons, and we have to incrementally navigate\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s probably where the wisdom is.\u201d\nChina has forbidden AI-generated images that impersonate people without their consent, and the European Union has proposed sweeping AI rules (which, like the EU\u2019s data rules, may reverberate globally). But America\u2019s reactive, incremental approach to making regulation up as its industries develop has kept it in the lead since the Industrial Revolution, and seems particularly suited to such a rapidly evolving, disruptive technology. Maybe AI and America\u2019s lawmakers, in the end, can help each other grow up. \u25a0\nRead more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics:\nWhy the multiverse is eating popular culture (Jun
