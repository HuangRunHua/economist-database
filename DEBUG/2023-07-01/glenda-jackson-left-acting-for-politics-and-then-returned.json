"articleBody": "Asked what her greatest or her best role was, Glenda Jackson\u2019s reaction was usually a snort or a sigh. Was it Gudrun in \u201cWomen in Love\u201d in 1969, blithely doing her amorous eurhythmics in front of a herd of cows? Was it Elizabeth R in the TV series in 1971, an imperious mask of shaven head and white paint? Or was it the asylum patient playing Charlotte Corday in \u201cMarat/Sade\u201d in 1967, falling dazed to her knees to sing a song to Marat, before tenderly contemplating the knife with which she would kill him? \nNo, none of those, she would say, searching for a hanky or looking the other way as the clips played behind her. She never watched her old stuff, anyway. She always insisted that her finest performance was in 1971 on the comedy show \u201cMorecambe and Wise\u201d, playing Cleopatra in a glossy black wig beside Ernie Wise as Mark Antony (dodgy tunic, lopsided helmet) and Eric Morecambe, in his owlish glasses, as \u201cOctavian Caesar\u201d. Eric had given her the best note she had ever had: \u201cDon\u2019t laugh, and speak up.\u201d She managed the second, but not the first. \nPraise didn\u2019t interest her, and nor did awards. She won an Oscar for \u201cWomen in Love\u201d, another for \u201cA Touch of Class\u201d, nominations for \u201cSunday Bloody Sunday\u201d and \u201cHedda\u201d. She won Emmys, Baftas and a Tony. Thank you kindly, she said, while inwardly muttering, Come off it! The Oscars went to her mother for bookends and her mother, being a cleaner, soon polished all the gilt off. \nAwards didn\u2019t mean that you got work afterwards. But she had to. She had started acting, as a bored teenager serving in Boots in northerly Birkenhead, because she thought there might be a job in it. (In her family, with a bricklayer father and six in the household, if you didn\u2019t work, you didn\u2019t eat.) Two years of RADA training got her bit parts round the country until the RSC recruited her. Work kept cropping up after that, but she stayed convinced, each time one job finished, that she wouldn\u2019t get another.\nThis was more than partly because she was a woman, and not  conventionally pretty, with her gawkiness and big uneven teeth. She had nowt to sell. Critics often said she had intelligence and power, but who wanted those in women? The whole acting world was tilted against them. They were almost never the dramatic centre of plays, just adjuncts on the sidelines. It was true in the 1960s, and it was still true in the 2020s. Good God, she had bitched about it for all those years, and nothing had changed.   \n\u201cElizabeth R\u201d was an exception. There she was regally, icily in charge. Courtiers cringed before her. She played the part again in the film \u201cMary, Queen of Scots\u201d, where her contempt almost toppled her rival off her horse. Yet she had also studied Elizabeth\u2019s softer side, finding that, for example, the great queen once went to sleep sucking her thumb. It was a six-part series, so they spent a long time together, that mythical figure and herself.   \nTruth was what she was after. Peter Brook, her favourite director, always demanded that. Absolute truth, which made you think in a new way. Shakespeare in his plays asked three great questions: Who are we? Why are we? What are we? Each role was an exploration of a human being, and of how human beings behaved towards each other. When she played standard women\u2019s roles, needy sidekicks to the male leads, such as Alex, the third point of the love-triangle in \u201cSunday Bloody Sunday\u201d, or even Ophelia in \u201cHamlet\u201d, she made sure to make them deeply interesting. \nYet she did not see herself as an actor. She was the character, seeing the world through their eyes. Since they were fascinating, and she was boring, she took on that fascination. Her most difficult role came in 2016 with the tv drama \u201cElizabeth is Missing\u201d, when she played a grandmother with Alzheimer\u2019s, drifting in and out of self-knowledge. Who was she then? And who was this tearful young woman at the bus stop, who said she was her daughter? Her lined face seemed to collapse with the effort to understand. \nThis preoccupation with human behaviour led in 1992 to an extraordinary decision, to give up stage and screen for politics. Pretty similar, really. If there was any one trigger, for she had been Labour all her life, it was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s remark that there was \u201cno such thing as society\u201d. Against her own expectations, she won Hampstead and Highgate\u2014north London wealth with patches of poverty\u2014and represented it, seriously but passionately, for 23 years. The House of Commons, she would tell people whose main image of her was of coltish rolling in the grass, was not at all a place for performance. You didn\u2019t dissemble or play games, because you were speaking for the voters who had put you there. You didn\u2019t pose. She did wear a scarlet jacket sometimes. \n Again, it was speaking truth that mattered most. She briefly became a junior transport minister, but savaged Tony Blair over Iraq. And when Thatcher died, rather than join in the syrupy tributes, she furiously attacked \u201cthe most heinous economic, social and spiritual damage\u201d her nemesis had caused. In her own constituency, shop doorways were now the bathrooms of the homeless. School walls were held together with Sellotape. Greed, selfishness and scorn for the weaker were now presented as virtues. Over the continuous male heckling her voice rose as strongly as Elizabeth I\u2019s, gravelly from years of smoking.      \nShe was sometimes asked if she could ever play Thatcher. Awful thought. She couldn\u2019t possibly get into the world Thatcher saw. But even stranger worlds she bravely entered. A year after stepping down from Parliament, in 2016, she played Lear on the London stage, howling in an old suit through the soaking storm. Later she took the show to New York. She was in her 80s. Ridiculous to think she had the energy! But she did, because the energy, like a roaring car, came from the work itself.   \nShe was glad to note that gender barriers were more fragile as she aged. Playing an old mad king was fine, and a liberation. She still had that bloody worry that, afterwards, she wouldn\u2019t get work again. Yet even as she died she had a film in the can, \u201cThe Great Escaper\u201d, with Michael Caine. She helped him to break out of his care home. Independence championed, to the last. \u25a0", "description": "The actress acclaimed on stage and in film died on June 15th, aged 87", "ogDescription": "The actress acclaimed on stage and in film died on June 15th, aged 87", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230701_OBP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-06-29T14:38:41Z", "dateModified": "2023-06-29T14:38:57Z", "dateCreated": "2023-06-28T09:34:49Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-07-01T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/bn46hmblrsm0iltei0irnbmhnon499nk", "publication": [{"id": "/content/a9kh3bod4dp4jjcjndtujs2fl4h9qgsg", "context": {"position": 2100.7, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/skhhsufqnbbvl7bourvsq48vcrp2cpen", "context": {"position": 2100.7, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/es4jit4fedm6bfhutuir3581a426d3rg", "context": {"position": 2100.7, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/aegghod6avs41riqpl2o8ojv4c18jr65", "context": {"position": 2100.7, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ea8nbbps3n12fnjeo8ins4gh0h1ritn2", "context": {"position": 2100.7, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/kvm4gm16sdd0se7aj6nfossdhvq4ptgs", "context": {"position": 2100.7, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/j85i79foapeo3ohgv8n4mqv7agrgc9mh", "context": {"position": 2100.7, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/3j9886o51s2pa0581mkqco17v43ci51d", "context": {"position": 2100.7, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Glenda Jackson left acting for politics\u2014and then returned", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/obituary/2023/06/29/glenda-jackson-left-acting-for-politics-and-then-returned", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
