note: A grand jury in Georgia indicted Donald Trump and 18 others on August 14th, after this article was published. They face a total of 41 charges, 13 of which are against Mr Trump. Fani Willis, Fulton County\u2019s district attorney, said she plans to try all 19 of the accused together.\nA PROSECUTOR IN Georgia appears ready to unveil criminal charges against Donald Trump, for attempting to reverse his loss in that state in the presidential election of 2020. These charges will land not long after Jack Smith, the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel, filed his historic four-count indictment of the former president for trying to overthrow the entire national election and remain in power. And last month Dana Nessel, Michigan\u2019s attorney-general, filed conspiracy and forgery charges against the 16 people who pretended to be Michigan\u2019s representatives to the electoral college in order to vote for Mr Trump, even though Joe Biden won the state.\nThe federal indictment has rightly been interpreted as a grave legal threat to the former president (though he denies any wrongdoing). But the forthcoming charges in Georgia, the existing ones in Michigan and others which may follow are equally important to defend voters in those jurisdictions and to achieve true accountability.\nWith Mr Smith\u2019s federal case moving along at a brisk clip, eyes are now turning to the Georgia prosecutor, Fani Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County. As soon as this week, she is widely expected to go well beyond Mr Trump in her own charging documents; there are reported to be more than a dozen defendants, possibly including pro-Trump imposter electors and Georgia Republican Party officials. The federal indictment may yet expand, and the special counsel\u2019s investigation continues. But the 2020 plot had dozens of foot soldiers, and state and local prosecutors are pursuing consequences for them. An alleged crime that caused harm nationally and in numerous states deserves both a federal and a state-by-state response.\nThis is because state and local prosecutors have different goals. They swear oaths to uphold the laws of their own jurisdictions, on behalf of the people. That means defending people\u2019s right to have their votes counted, and defending the results of our free and fair elections. And it\u2019s why state and local prosecutors are justified in bringing charges for the pieces of the 2020 plot relevant to their own states.\nMr Smith has focused his federal case squarely on Mr Trump and the conspiracy he allegedly led to obstruct the electoral count and defraud the country. The special counsel has evidently done so because he wants a quick trial. That is for good reason: the American people deserve to know as soon as possible whether the former president\u2014and leading candidate for a major party\u2019s nomination in 2024\u2014is a felon.\nHowever, the federal indictment also describes Mr Trump\u2019s attempts to subvert legitimate election results in seven states, including Georgia and Michigan. So it is fair to ask, as some observers have, whether we are now going to have seven separate state and local indictments on top of the federal one.\nIt appears not, as a number of states do not seem to be moving forward. But it is fair for different states to make different decisions\u2014and if several decide to address the harm within their borders, that is fine, too. In the decentralised American system, elections are guided by state and local laws. State and local leaders, including attorneys-general and district attorneys, have a responsibility to defend those laws and the voters they represent.\nIn each of the seven states, Mr Trump and his associates were allegedly trying to take away the voices of voters\u2014their freedom to decide elections for themselves. State and local prosecutors are defending that most fundamental freedom. By bringing charges, they are sending a message: don\u2019t try this in our state ever again.\nMs Nessel put it simply: the fake electors \u201cplainly violated the laws by which we administer our elections in Michigan\u201d. It would be dereliction of duty, she explained, to fail to address \u201coverwhelming evidence of an organised effort to circumvent the lawfully cast ballots of millions of Michigan voters in a presidential election\u201d.\nMr Trump disrupted the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in American history. We must make sure no future president tries anything like that ever again. Our guiding principles must be no tolerance of attacks on our elections, and accountability at every level. No dimension of this assault on democracy should be left unexamined.\nAs Mr Trump\u2019s indictments pile up, the numerous cases will inevitably collide with the 2024 political calendar. But as the judge in the federal election case wisely observed, the administration of justice must proceed regardless of any defendant\u2019s schedule or \u201cday job\u201d\u2014even if that job is a presidential campaign.\nIf he is indicted in Georgia, Mr Trump may lean on the same defences he plans to use in the federal case. They don\u2019t hold up. He may claim, for example, that the First Amendment\u2019s free-speech protections apply to his phone call demanding that Georgia\u2019s secretary of state find enough votes to give him a victory. But criminal conduct, including the pressuring of state officials, is not protected speech. He may argue that he genuinely believed the election was stolen from him in Georgia, but such a belief would not allow him to break the law.\nMr Trump and his enablers in the media may well react to any indictment in Georgia by claiming (once again) that it is part of a political feeding frenzy and attacking the credibility of duty-bound officials. But those attacks will be in bad faith. They are part of a strategy to threaten and scare state and local prosecutors into shying away from taking on tough cases like these.\nThis is not personal, and it is not political. It is not about getting Mr Trump at all costs. It\u2019s about taking every possible step to protect American democracy and the rule of law.
