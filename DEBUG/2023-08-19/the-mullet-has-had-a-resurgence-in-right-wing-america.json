Mane\u201d Powell\u2019s mullet just right, his mother said you can hear the national anthem playing and bald eagles cawing in the distance. For Easton \u201cThe Ida-Flow\u201d Klink, the hairdo is a symbol of \u201c247 years of American fan favourites\u201d like barbecue and big trucks. Catch Brantley \u201cBK\u201d Kirwin shaking his locks at concerts and he\u2019ll tell you about his love for the military and \u201cMERICA\u201d. \nThese are some of the contestants, all under the age of 12, who competed to be crowned \u201cUSA Kid Mullet Champ\u201d this week. Offbeat cuts unite kids from the islands of Hawaii to the suburbs of Nashville; girls in daycare centres across the country reportedly drool over them. Together the 25 mullet-rivals, many of whom have kin in uniform, raised $125,000 for a wounded veterans charity. \nThe competition, along with ones for teens, men and women, started during the pandemic. When barbershops reopened \u201cthe mullet came screaming back,\u201d says Kevin Begola, the contest\u2019s bald founder. Google searches for the hairdo have since soared. To many, the look is a lifestyle. Members of \u201cThe Mullet That Changed My Life\u201d Facebook group talk of finding \u201clifelong friends\u201d in the mullet community. One young entrant says that because of his mullet he gets high-fives on the street from \u201cAmerica\u2019s finest\u201d; another says the cut gave him the guts to confront school bullies. \nAustralians claim it as their national do. Yet the \u201cbusiness in the front, party in the back\u201d fashion has a long history in America too. In the late 18th century Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers, apparently used his \u201cskullet\u201d (a bald-headed mullet) to dazzle Frenchmen into investing in the new, unabashed nation. Years later Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce tribe donned a braided mullet in protest against the conventional styles of the missionaries who stole his people\u2019s land.\nIn the modern era the look came to exemplify the iconoclasm of the 1970s. Glam rocker David Bowie debuted his goldfish-coloured mullet the same year that he came out as gay\u2014its androgyny was seen as a rejection of gender norms. Jane Fonda, an actress blacklisted from Hollywood for her anti-Vietnam war activism, sported one in a famous mugshot. In the \u201880s Cher, Prince and Tina Turner made the mullet somewhat mainstream. Islamic leaders in Iran have since banned the look in an attempt to rid their country of \u201cdecadent\u201d Western styles. \nWhen the mullet came roaring back in recent years, it was oil-riggers and truckers who most notably wore it. While the cut remains hot in queer circles\u2014lesbian TikTok is awash with mulleted-\u201dmascs\u201d\u2014it now represents a new right-wing streak of non-conformism. Until he shaved it last week Morgan Wallen, a country-music star briefly cancelled for saying the n-word, was the pride of America\u2019s mullet-men. When asked if he planned to cut his hair after the contest, Dre \u201cThe Electric Slide\u201d Bell, a nine-year-old from Alabama, said certainly not. Just as the Biblical Samson\u2019s lush Nazarite locks gave him his strength, the mullet carries a certain power. \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly
