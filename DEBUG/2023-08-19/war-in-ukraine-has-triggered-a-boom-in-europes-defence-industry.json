crisis\n\n\u201cWE ARE WORKING flat-out,\u201d says Armin Papperger, chief executive of Rheinmetall, Germany\u2019s biggest arms-maker. Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, the D\u00fcsseldorf-based maker of tanks, ammunition and other military kit has been inundated with orders. On August 10th the firm reported that sales of its military ware in the first half of the year had risen by 12% compared with the same period in 2022, and Mr Papperger expects growth to hit 20-30% for the year as a whole. A few days later the company said it had secured an order from the Ukrainian army for drones, and on August 18th it is due to inaugurate a large new factory in Hungary. Its share price has roughly tripled since the start of last year.\nIn the decades after the end of the cold war Western defence budgets dwindled, procurement decisions were put on ice and the industry scaled back its production. The war in Ukraine has jolted it back into action. \u201cDefence budgets move with the geopolitical threat,\u201d says George Zhao of Bernstein, a broker. That threat is now all too clear to governments, leading to a deluge of demand for arms. Nowhere is that more true than in Europe.\n\nLast year military budgets worldwide rose by 3.7%, to $2.2trn. In Europe they increased by 13%, faster than in any other region. Growth was particularly pronounced in countries nearest to Russia. Finland\u2019s military budget rose by 36%, Lithuania\u2019s by 27%, Sweden\u2019s by 12% and Poland\u2019s by 11%. Germany, the continent\u2019s largest economy, is at last reversing its decades-long miserliness over military spending. In February last year the government pledged to increase the country\u2019s defence expenditure from around 1.4% of GDP to 2% and announced a \u20ac100bn ($110bn) \u201cspecial fund\u201d for the armed forces. \nThat is translating into big business for European defence contractors, who have secured a flurry of new contracts for military ware in recent months. In April the British arm of MBDA, a pan-European maker of missiles, signed a \u00a31.9bn ($2.4bn) contract to supply air-defence systems to Poland. In June Safran, a French arms-maker, sold several tactical drones to the Greek army. In July BAE Systems, a British defence firm, struck a deal to replenish the British army\u2019s stock of artillery shells. That same month Rheinmetall won a contract for munitions from the German government worth up to \u20ac4bn and a \u20ac1.9bn contract to supply the Germans and Dutch with more than 3,000 airborne vehicles. \u201cThis will be our best year for orders ever,\u201d rejoices Rheinmetall\u2019s Mr Papperger.\nIndustry analysts expect order books to keep getting fatter as the continent upgrades its armies. If anything, European governments expect the security environment to become more threatening in the years ahead. \u201cThe upwards trend of defence expenditure will last,\u201d predicts Lucie B\u00e9raud-Sudreau of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a think-tank. Last year Rheinmetall added 2,000 staff to its almost 30,000 workers, and plans to continue hiring. Saab, a Swedish peer, added 1,000 to its 18,000. \nYet not all is rosy for Europe\u2019s arms-makers. In June the industry\u2019s bosses met European defence ministers at NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels to air a number of grievances about how the industry operates on the continent.\nOne problem is a lack of visibility. Michael Sch\u00f6llhorn, head of the defence division of Airbus, a European aerospace giant, complains that many countries offer little guidance on their long-term spending plans, making it hard for companies to invest. Micael Johansson, boss of Saab, grumbles that his firm has so far taken on all the risk of increasing production.\nBosses also bemoan the red tape that drags out defence procurement. In Germany, any defence contract worth more than a paltry \u20ac25m must be approved by the Bundestag\u2019s budget committee, leading to painful delays. After Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, announced the country\u2019s new military fund in February last year, it took until December for lawmakers to approve a \u20ac13bn spending package for fighter jets and other military equipment.\nA final problem is the lack of co-ordination among European allies. Many governments opt to buy tanks and other bits of their war apparatus either from national champions or American firms, limiting the potential for economies of scale among the continent\u2019s defence contractors. While there is much talk of \u201cEuropean defence\u201d, the reality is much more fragmented, says Airbus\u2019s Mr Sch\u00f6llhorn. Saab\u2019s Mr Johansson argues that, after years of under-investment, European defence contractors will need to work together on issues such as supply-chain bottlenecks in order to meet booming demand.\nThese difficulties, however, may ease over time. European governments are already tidying up their defence procurement. Boris Pistorius, Germany\u2019s newish defence minister, has teamed up with Christian Freuding, an army general, to cut red tape. France\u2019s defence minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, is on a similar mission. There are signs of improved co-ordination, too. In November France, Spain and Germany at last struck a deal to build a European fighter jet. And consolidation in Europe\u2019s fragmented defence industry could help. On August 1st Rheinmetall completed its acquisition of Expal, a Spanish maker of ammunition. Mr Johansson thinks that more such tie-ups are likely. \nThe war in Ukraine marked a sharp reversal from decades of peace in Europe. For the continent\u2019s armsmakers, who languished during the geopolitical calm, it points to a more profitable future. \u25a0\nTo stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign
