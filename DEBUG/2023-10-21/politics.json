The incident triggered outrage in the Arab world, leading Jordan to cancel a summit between Mr Biden and the leaders of Jordan and Egypt and Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority. \nThe humanitarian situation worsened in Gaza, where about 3,500 people have been killed, according to the Palestinians, amid Israel\u2019s retaliation for the Hamas attack. Under mounting international pressure, Israel will allow food, water and medicine to cross from Egypt to southern Gaza, where the population has moved to take shelter. King Abdullah of Jordan warned that the \u201cregion is on the brink of falling into the abyss\u201d, but was adamant that his country and Egypt would not accept refugees. \nIsrael\u2019s ground troops were poised to enter Gaza. They have been held back in part because of fears that Hizbullah, a powerful militia based in Lebanon, will launch a big assault across the border into northern Israel at the moment when Israeli soldiers are focused on Gaza. Hizbullah is backed by Iran, which has warned that an \u201caxis\u201d of militias is ready to open \u201cmultiple fronts\u201d against Israel.  \nThe French government put the country on the highest state of alert after an Islamist extremist stabbed a teacher to death. Soldiers were drafted in to boost security and all pro-Palestinian demonstrations were banned. In Brussels a supporter of Islamic State shot dead two Swedish nationals. In Illinois a six-year-old boy died after being stabbed 26 times by his mother\u2019s landlord. The mother was wounded. Police say they were targeted because they were Muslim. \nAnti-Semitic incidents and \u201ccelebrations\u201d of the attack by Hamas were reported throughout Europe. London\u2019s police force reported a big rise in assaults on Jewish targets. Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, reminded people that showing support for the terrorist group could be punishable by a prison sentence. \n\nIn Poland the liberal Civic Coalition and its allies won enough seats at an election to form a majority in parliament, heralding a big shift in government. The conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, a thorn in the EU\u2019s side since gaining power in 2015, came first but will struggle to rule, even with the support of a far-right party. It is expected to get the first stab at forming a government; talks could take weeks. Donald Tusk, the leader of the Civic Coalition, called on the country\u2019s PiS-allied president to swiftly start the process.   \nUkraine has used long-range ATACMS missiles for the first time, according to Volodymyr Zelensky, the country\u2019s president. The missiles were reportedly used to attack Russian bases in east Ukraine, destroying nine helicopters. America silently provided the missiles to Ukraine, rather than announcing their deployment, apparently to take the Russians by surprise. \nFriends in need\nVladimir Putin visited China, where he tried to gain support for his war on Ukraine. The Russian president went to a summit held by Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, on China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. European delegates walked out of one meeting he attended. But not Viktor Orban. The Hungarian prime minister  shook Mr Putin\u2019s hand, the first EU leader to do so since the start of the war. \nRepublicans in America\u2019s House of Representatives continued to squabble over choosing a new speaker. After spurning Steve Scalise, they were unenthusiastic about rallying around Jim Jordan. \nVoters in Australia decisively rejected a constitutional amendment that would have created an advisory body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. The referendum on the Voice, as it was dubbed, was beaten by 61% to 39% and failed in all six Australian states. Critics of the proposal said it would have undermined the principle of legal equality by favouring one racial group in the constitution.\n\nThe centre-right National Party won New Zealand\u2019s general election, ending the six-year rule of the Labour Party, formerly led by Jacinda Ardern. Christopher Luxon, the incoming prime minister, will form a coalition with the ACT party, which is classically liberal. But with a slim majority he may have to rely on the populist New Zealand First Party for support.\n\nIndia\u2019s Supreme Court declined to legalise gay marriage, accepting the government\u2019s argument that only Parliament could decide the status of marriage in the country. \nPro-democracy campaigners in Indonesia were outraged by the decision of the Constitutional Court to add an exception to a law that bars people under the age of 40 from running for president. The court said that people who have been elected to regional posts can now run, which would allow the 36-year-old son of the outgoing incumbent, Joko Widodo,  to contest February\u2019s election.\nSeparatists in Indonesia\u2019s Papua province claimed responsibility for an attack on a gold mine that killed seven people. The rebels repeated their warning to non-indigenous Papuans to leave the mountainous region.   \nTwo tourists and their guide were killed in a terrorist attack in Uganda that the government blamed on the Allied Democratic Forces, which declares allegiance to Islamic State. The attack was in the Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is close to the border with Congo.\nUN peacekeepers in Mali are struggling to leave the country by the end of the year, as agreed, because of a rapid deterioration in security that is preventing it from retrieving equipment. Some 300 blue helmets have been killed over the course of the ten-year-long mission.\nDaniel Noboa was elected as Ecuador\u2019s president. The 35-year-old businessman is a centrist who has promised to reduce crime, the big issue during the election. A presidential candidate was assassinated in August. Mr Noboa\u2019s victory is a rejection of the leftist faction aligned with Rafael Correa, a disgraced former president. \nRepresentatives from Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s autocratic regime in Venezuela and the opposition met in Barbados, their first meeting in nearly a year. Some progress was made as the two sides agreed to a timeline for an election in 2024. After the talks America relaxed sanctions on the country\u2019s oil sector. \n \nDon\u2019t try this at home\nPepper X was named as the world\u2019s hottest chilli by Guinness World Records. The previous record was held by the Carolina Reaper. Both are grown by Ed Currie (no pun intended), a farmer from South Carolina. Pepper X rates at nearly 2.7m Scoville Heat Units (a jalape\u00f1o is around 3,000 to 8,000). Mr Currie said he was in severe pain with cramps for an hour after eating a whole one.", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "Politics", "section": {"url":

attack by Hamas was overshadowed by a blast at a hospital in Gaza, which the Palestinians said killed hundreds of people. America and Israel pointed to intelligence that suggests the explosion was caused by a missile launched by Islamic Jihad, another militant group, that misfired, falling in the hospital\u2019s car park. Hamas and many Arab countries said an Israeli strike was to blame. The incident triggered outrage in the Arab world, leading Jordan to cancel a summit between Mr Biden and the leaders of Jordan and Egypt and Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority. \nThe humanitarian situation worsened in Gaza, where about 3,500 people have been killed, according to the Palestinians, amid Israel\u2019s retaliation for the Hamas attack. Under mounting international pressure, Israel will allow food, water and medicine to cross from Egypt to southern Gaza, where the population has moved to take shelter. King Abdullah of Jordan warned that the \u201cregion is on the brink of falling into the abyss\u201d, but was adamant that his country and Egypt would not accept refugees. \nIsrael\u2019s ground troops were poised to enter Gaza. They have been held back in part because of fears that Hizbullah, a powerful militia based in Lebanon, will launch a big assault across the border into northern Israel at the moment when Israeli soldiers are focused on Gaza. Hizbullah is backed by Iran, which has warned that an \u201caxis\u201d of militias is ready to open \u201cmultiple fronts\u201d against Israel.  \nThe French government put the country on the highest state of alert after an Islamist extremist stabbed a teacher to death. Soldiers were drafted in to boost security and all pro-Palestinian demonstrations were banned. In Brussels a supporter of Islamic State shot dead two Swedish nationals. In Illinois a six-year-old boy died after being stabbed 26 times by his mother\u2019s landlord. The mother was wounded. Police say they were targeted because they were Muslim. \nAnti-Semitic incidents and \u201ccelebrations\u201d of the attack by Hamas were reported throughout Europe. London\u2019s police force reported a big rise in assaults on Jewish targets. Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, reminded people that showing support for the terrorist group could be punishable by a prison sentence. \n\nIn Poland the liberal Civic Coalition and its allies won enough seats at an election to form a majority in parliament, heralding a big shift in government. The conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, a thorn in the EU\u2019s side since gaining power in 2015, came first but will struggle to rule, even with the support of a far-right party. It is expected to get the first stab at forming a government; talks could take weeks. Donald Tusk, the leader of the Civic Coalition, called on the country\u2019s PiS-allied president to swiftly start the process.   \nUkraine has used long-range ATACMS missiles for the first time, according to Volodymyr Zelensky, the country\u2019s president. The missiles were reportedly used to attack Russian bases in east Ukraine, destroying nine helicopters. America silently provided the missiles to Ukraine, rather than announcing their deployment, apparently to take the Russians by surprise. \nFriends in need\nVladimir Putin visited China, where he tried to gain support for his war on Ukraine. The Russian president went to a summit held by Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, on China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. European delegates walked out of one meeting he attended. But not Viktor Orban. The Hungarian prime minister  shook Mr Putin\u2019s hand, the first EU leader to do so since the start of the war. \nRepublicans in America\u2019s House of Representatives continued to squabble over choosing a new speaker. After spurning Steve Scalise, they were unenthusiastic about rallying around Jim Jordan. \nVoters in Australia decisively rejected a constitutional amendment that would have created an advisory body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. The referendum on the Voice, as it was dubbed, was beaten by 61% to 39% and failed in all six Australian states. Critics of the proposal said it would have undermined the principle of legal equality by favouring one racial group in the constitution.\n\nThe centre-right National Party won New Zealand\u2019s general election, ending the six-year rule of the Labour Party, formerly led by Jacinda Ardern. Christopher Luxon, the incoming prime minister, will form a coalition with the ACT party, which is classically liberal. But with a slim majority he may have to rely on the populist New Zealand First Party for support.\n\nIndia\u2019s Supreme Court declined to legalise gay marriage, accepting the government\u2019s argument that only Parliament could decide the status of marriage in the country. \nPro-democracy campaigners in Indonesia were outraged by the decision of the Constitutional Court to add an exception to a law that bars people under the age of 40 from running for president. The court said that people who have been elected to regional posts can now run, which would allow the 36-year-old son of the outgoing incumbent, Joko Widodo,  to contest February\u2019s election.\nSeparatists in Indonesia\u2019s Papua province claimed responsibility for an attack on a gold mine that killed seven people. The rebels repeated their warning to non-indigenous Papuans to leave the mountainous region.   \nTwo tourists and their guide were killed in a terrorist attack in Uganda that the government blamed on the Allied Democratic Forces, which declares allegiance to Islamic State. The attack was in the Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is close to the border with Congo.\nUN peacekeepers in Mali are struggling to leave the country by the end of the year, as agreed, because of a rapid deterioration in security that is preventing it from retrieving equipment. Some 300 blue helmets have been killed over the course of the ten-year-long mission.\nDaniel Noboa was elected as Ecuador\u2019s president. The 35-year-old businessman is a centrist who has promised to reduce crime, the big issue during the election. A presidential candidate was assassinated in August. Mr Noboa\u2019s victory is a rejection of the leftist faction aligned with Rafael Correa, a disgraced former president. \nRepresentatives from Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s autocratic regime in Venezuela and the opposition met in Barbados, their first meeting in nearly a year. Some progress was made as the two sides agreed to a timeline for an election in 2024. After the talks America relaxed sanctions on the country\u2019s oil sector. \n \nDon\u2019t try this at home\nPepper X was named as the world\u2019s hottest chilli by Guinness World Records. The previous record was held by the Carolina Reaper. Both are grown by Ed Currie (no pun intended), a farmer from South Carolina. Pepper X rates at nearly 2.7m Scoville Heat Units (a jalape\u00f1o is around 3,000 to 8,000). Mr Currie said he was in severe pain with cramps for an hour after eating a whole one.", "description": "", "ogDescription": "", "imageUrl":
