from its covid-19 controls was meant to be the biggest economic event of the year. Instead, the reopening has turned into one of the biggest disappointments. In a recent survey by Bank of America, fund managers in Asia expressed their \u201cfatigue and frustration\u201d with China\u2019s weak growth and the lack of a concerted government response. \nOn the face of it, economic data released on October 18th should cheer them up. The figures showed that China\u2019s economy grew by 4.9% in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier\u2014faster than expected. And its growth compared with the previous quarter was stronger still: 5.3% at an annualised rate. The economy should now have little trouble meeting the government\u2019s growth target of \u201caround 5%\u201d for this year. ubs, a bank, raised its forecast for 2023 from 4.8% to 5.2%.\nThe source of the growth was also encouraging. Consumption contributed almost 95% of it, noted Sheng Laiyun of China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics. There are signs that the country\u2019s beleaguered households may be coming out of their shells. Demand for longer-term loans is growing; the saving rate, adjusted for the season, fell below 30% of disposable income for the first time since the pandemic, according to Yi Xiong of Deutsche Bank.\nOne reason for this may be improvements in the job market. Urban unemployment fell to 5% in September from 5.2% in the previous month and the average workweek lengthened. Household debt burdens have also eased a little. Chinese policymakers have instructed banks to cut the interest rate on outstanding mortgages in line with the lower rates available for new ones. On October 13th the central bank announced that the interest rate on existing mortgages, worth 21.7trn yuan ($3trn), had been lowered by 0.73 percentage points, which should free up over 100bn yuan of spending power a year.\n\nBut the good news for households was not matched by good news for houses. The property market remains dangerously weak. The amount of residential floor space sold by property developers in September was 21% below that sold last year. Increasingly, China\u2019s developers must actually finish buildings before they can sell them. Completed buildings accounted for almost a quarter of sales in September, compared with less than 13% in 2021. \nThe threat of deflation lingers, too. China\u2019s annual nominal growth, which includes inflation, was 3.5% in the third quarter, lower than the real, inflation-adjusted figure. This suggests that prices of goods and services fell by almost 1.4%, the second drop in a row (see chart 1), which makes the current period China\u2019s worst deflationary spell since 2009.  \nThus fatigue and frustration should not give way to complacency. At the imf\u2019s annual meeting, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the fund\u2019s chief economist, called for \u201cforceful action\u201d from China\u2019s government to restructure struggling property developers, contain financial dangers and redeploy fiscal measures to help households. \nThe government has taken some steps. It has allowed a growing number of local governments to issue \u201crefinancing bonds\u201d, which will help clear late payments to suppliers and replace the more expensive debt owed by local-government financing vehicles. The authorities seem keen to prevent any of these vehicles from defaulting. \n\nBut preserving financial stability is not the same as reviving growth. The government\u2019s efforts to stimulate demand have so far been both piecemeal and grudging. Its fear of doing too much seems to outweigh its fear of doing too little. With the official growth target in sight, policymakers may now be tempted to wait and see how the recovery evolves before pursuing further stimulus. In the face of a hostile America and turbulent geopolitics, it appears keen to keep its fiscal powder dry. \nStill, it is hard to see how deflation strengthens China\u2019s position. The imf now thinks that China\u2019s prices, as measured by its gdp deflator, will fall this year compared with last. Combined with the yuan\u2019s weakness, gdp could shrink in dollar terms. Indeed, China\u2019s economy will gain little ground on America\u2019s in the next five years, according to the fund (see chart 2). \nThe contrast with the imf\u2019s April forecast is stark. In the space of six months, the fund has shorn off more than $15trn, in today\u2019s dollars, from China\u2019s cumulative gdp for the years from 2023 to 2028. Few economies can match China\u2019s scale. And that includes the scale of its disappointments. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only
