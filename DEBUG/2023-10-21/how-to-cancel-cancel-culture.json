When two sides cannot even agree on facts, \u201cit undermines faith in all of the institutions we rely on to understand the world,\u201d they write.   \nMr Lukianoff and Ms Schlott offer a critique of the left, pointing out how cancel culture has eroded academic freedom at universities. But they are equally critical of the right. They note that some of Florida\u2019s new education laws (including one that bans certain subjects from being taught) are \u201cwithout question unconstitutional\u201d.\nBoth books are bold, timely and buttressed by data. They also offer plausible remedies. The far right can be defeated only by the right and the far left by the left. So left-of-centre people who can see what is happening should speak up but not vilify those who disagree. (Political disagreement is not moral failure, Mr Mounk reminds readers.) People should appeal to the reasonable majority, he argues, since most people are neither \u201cwoke\u201d nor Trumpist. They should not let their indignation turn them into reactionaries.  \nThe advice from Mr Lukianoff and Ms Schlott is more personal: raise kids who are not cancellers. Teach them that life is not a battle between wholly good and bad people. Not every \u201charm\u201d that someone, somewhere calls out is really harmful. Educating children about differences, rather than coddling and insulating them, is essential. \n\u201cThe Cancelling of the American Mind\u201d advises companies to foster an intellectually diverse workforce. Bosses should make clear that a commitment to free speech is a condition of employment. And universities should scrap political litmus tests for tenure and get back to teaching students how to debate ideas.\nThe post-liberal right and post-liberal left are much closer to each other than many people realise. Both are intolerant; both prioritise the power of the state over individual liberty. They \u201csee each other as mortal enemies\u201d, but \u201cfeed on each other\u201d, Mr Mounk warns. That is why \u201ceveryone who cares about the survival of free societies should vow to fight both.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to

"The Identity Trap: A Story of Ideas and Power in Our Time. By Yascha Mounk. Penguin; 416 pages; $32. Allen Lane; \u00a325.\nThe Cancelling of the American Mind: How Cancel Culture Undermines Trust, Destroys Institutions, and Threatens Us All. By Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott. Simon & Schuster; 464 pages; $29.99. Allen Lane; \u00a325\nYascha Mounk\u2019s book contains several jolting stories, which encapsulate the extreme thinking of some on the American left. When covid-19 vaccines became available, most countries dispensed them first to health workers and the elderly (who are much more vulnerable to the disease than young people). Yet America\u2019s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention urged states to offer priority to 87m \u201cessential workers\u201d, which included package-delivery drivers and film crews. Its rationale was \u201cracial equity\u201d, because old people were more likely to be white, even though such a policy would probably cause thousands more deaths.\nIn another story, an African-American mother tried to get her seven-year-old into a class at school. The principal said no: \u201cThat\u2019s not the black class.\u201d This was not a scene from the Jim Crow South of the 1950s, but from present-day America, where a growing number of \u201cprogressive\u201d schools group children by race and teach them to think of themselves as \u201cracial beings\u201d, all in the name of \u201cantiracism\u201d.\nMr Mounk, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, is a man of the left. (\u201cBarack Obama is the American politician I most admire.\u201d) He grew up believing that \u201chumans matter equally irrespective of the group to which they belong.\u201d His book, \u201cThe Identity Trap\u201d, explains why many on the left abandoned \u201cuniversalism\u201d. He summarises the \u201cwoke\u201d left\u2019s logic as follows: \u201cto ensure that each ethnic, religious or sexual community enjoys a proportionate share of income and wealth\u2026both private actors and public institutions must make the way they treat people depend on the groups to which they belong.\u201d\nMost of the people who espouse this view aspire to improve the world, and many of the injustices they rail against are real. But the policies they advocate \u201care likely to create a society\u2026of warring tribes rather than co-operating compatriots\u201d. The word \u201cliberal\u201d has long been used in America to mean \u201cleft-wing\u201d, but many on the left now reject basic liberal notions such as universal values and free speech. Across the English-speaking world and beyond, they have become intolerant of those who do not accept their dogma or their identity politics. \nDismissing \u201cwokeness\u201d as just well-meaning millennials pushing for social justice is therefore a mistake, Mr Mounk argues. Not enough people understand that the far left is \u201cmoving beyond\u2014or outright discarding\u2014the traditional rules and norms of democracies\u201d. He has long been concerned about the authoritarian right but says it is reasonably well understood (democracy-deniers and all), whereas the intellectual history of the authoritarian left is \u201coddly unexplored territory\u201d. \nHow did views that are unpopular with the general public become so influential? In Mr Mounk\u2019s telling, it starts with group psychology. When like-minded people debate political or moral questions, their conclusions become \u201cmore radical than the beliefs of their individual members\u201d, he writes. This tendency is compounded when the group feels under threat, as progressives did during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Dissent is suddenly seen as betrayal: hence the fury unleashed on anybody who violates the group\u2019s unwritten and shifting norms. More than three out of five Americans now say they avoid airing their political views for fear of suffering adverse consequences; only a quarter of college students say they are comfortable discussing controversial topics with their peers.\nStudents who imbibed what Mr Mounk rather clunkily calls \u201cthe identity synthesis\u201d on campus went on \u201ca short march through the institutions\u201d after they graduated. Since about 2010 they have carried their new ideology into the workplace and, thanks to the power of social media to create hurricanes of outrage, intimidated bosses like no previous generation. Young activists-cum-employees pushed the American Civil Liberties Union to scrap its iron commitment to free speech and risk-averse corporate managers to sign off on some counter-productive \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d training. A slide in a presentation at Coca-Cola, for example, exhorted employees to \u201ctry to be less white\u201d.\nFar from solving the real injustices that persist, this way of thinking and talking threatens to exacerbate them. And instead of bracing the country to withstand Mr Trump\u2019s influence, it helps him, as Middle America leans right in response to the far left\u2019s excesses. Mr Mounk\u2019s answer is a return to classical liberalism: a rediscovery of universal values and neutral rules, allowing people to make common cause with others of different beliefs and origins. People should live up to the ideals on which liberal democracy is based rather than abandoning them because they are so difficult to achieve, he says. \nWhile Mr Mounk\u2019s message is global, Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott focus on America. \u201cThe Cancelling of the American Mind\u201d is a cri de coeur for both sides to reclaim \u201cfree-speech culture\u201d. (The authors work for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free-speech group.) When two sides cannot even agree on facts, \u201cit undermines faith in all of the institutions we rely on to understand the world,\u201d they write.   \nMr Lukianoff and Ms Schlott offer a critique of the left, pointing out how cancel culture has eroded academic freedom at universities. But they are equally critical of the right. They note that some of Florida\u2019s new education laws (including one that bans certain subjects from being taught) are \u201cwithout question unconstitutional\u201d.\nBoth books are bold, timely and buttressed by data. They also offer plausible remedies. The far right can be defeated only by the right and the far left by the left. So left-of-centre people who can see what is happening should speak up but not vilify those who disagree. (Political disagreement is not moral failure, Mr Mounk reminds readers.) People should appeal to the reasonable majority, he argues, since most people are neither \u201cwoke\u201d nor Trumpist. They should not let their indignation turn them into reactionaries.  \nThe advice from Mr Lukianoff and Ms Schlott is more personal: raise kids who are not cancellers. Teach them that life is not a battle between wholly good and bad people. Not every \u201charm\u201d that someone, somewhere calls out is really harmful. Educating children about differences, rather than coddling and insulating them, is essential. \n\u201cThe Cancelling of the American Mind\u201d advises companies to foster an intellectually diverse workforce. Bosses should make clear that a commitment to free speech is a condition of employment. And universities should scrap political litmus tests for tenure and get back to teaching students how to debate ideas.\nThe post-liberal right and post-liberal left are much closer to each other than many people realise. Both are intolerant; both prioritise the power of the state over individual liberty. They \u201csee each other as mortal enemies\u201d, but \u201cfeed on each other\u201d, Mr Mounk warns. That is why \u201ceveryone who cares about the survival of free societies should vow to fight both.\u201d \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to
