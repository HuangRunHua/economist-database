one rolled up his sleeve on July 12th last year. Volunteer two put out an arm to give blood the same day. Volunteer 100 stepped onto the scales on August 3rd. A tape measure was slipped around the waist of volunteer 1,000 on September 30th. Then things sped up: volunteer 100,000 gave blood this March. The roll is now growing so fast\u2014by thousands every day\u2014that putting a precise number in print is pointless: by the time you read this it will be out of date. By the end of this year this research study\u2014called Our Future Health\u2014will be Britain\u2019s largest of its kind. By the end of next year, the world\u2019s.  \nAcross Britain, the study is unfurling. In Liverpool and in London, in Manchester and Grimsby and Oxford, in dreary supermarket car parks, mobile vans are drawing up, cubicle curtains being drawn back and queues forming. The plan is to recruit 5m people\u2014almost as many as there are in Norway\u2014and get them weighed, measured, quizzed, genotyped, phenotyped. Then to put the data to work to see who gets sick, with what, and when, and why\u2014and if intervening early can help. The aim is simple. To save them\u2014and the NHS. Because as Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and the study\u2019s chair, says, the NHS is \u201cnot sustainable in its current form\u201d.\n\nThe NHS has two main problems. The first is that it works badly. The second is that it works well. Its failings\u2014waiting lists, queuing ambulances, costs invariably labelled \u201cspiralling\u201d\u2014are well known. Its successes are harder to see\u2014but are there in those same lists, queues and costs. For all exist, in part, because the NHS is keeping many alive who would, without it, be dead. But not being dead is not the same as being healthily alive: an average Briton may reach only 60 or so in good fettle (see chart. As Raghib Ali, the chief medical officer of Our Future Health (and its volunteer number one), says: \u201cWhat we have\u2026is not really a National Health Service but a national sickness service.\u201d\nIt was never meant to be like this. When in 1943 Winston Churchill promised Britain a health service \u201cfrom the cradle to the grave\u201d no one dreamt that Britons would spend so long with one foot in that grave, or cost so much as they stood there. On the contrary: it was thought that the NHS would get cheaper over time as Britons\u2014laid in their cradles by NHS midwives, fortified by NHS vaccinations\u2014would gaze through their newly issued NHS spectacles to a bright, healthy future. The NHS\u2019s very existence, wrote William Beveridge, its architect, would lead to \u201ca reduction in the number of cases requiring it\u201d. It was, one politician later said, \u201ca miscalculation of sublime dimensions\u201d. \nIn its first year the NHS promptly ran twice over budget, not helped by those NHS specs, of which twice as many pairs (8m) were handed out as had been expected. Aneurin Bevan, the father of the NHS, grumbled that \u201ccascades of medicine [are] pouring down British throats\u2014and they\u2019re not even bringing the bottles back.\u201d It has not got cheaper: the budget for NHS England is \u00a3169bn ($205bn) this year. Its prognosis is \u201chopeless, actually\u201d, says Sir John. People tend to use the verb \u201ccollapse\u201d to describe the end of the NHS. It will not. It will do something worse: it will ebb. Those who can afford to leave, will. Those who can\u2019t will stay and queue and suffer. \u201cOur NHS\u201d will, almost imperceptibly, become \u201cTheir NHS\u201d. And Bevan\u2019s dream will be lost.\nTo save it Britain must do no less than \u201cpivot the way we deliver health care\u201d, says Sir John. The NHS must stop mainly treating people who are manifestly very sick and get them when they still, ostensibly, seem well. Which is why, on a rainy Friday afternoon, Dr Ali, slight, clever, softly spoken, is standing in an unprepossessing Tesco car park in Watford outside a yellow van. On it is the Our Future Health logo\u2014and the NHS one. (The study is a public-private partnership: one-third of its \u00a3239m budget is funded by government, two-thirds by life-sciences companies.) Inside, people wait as a fine drizzle falls.\nThe unprepossessing air of this study\u2014all those car parks\u2014is not accidental. The life-expectancy gap between Britain\u2019s richest and poorest local authorities is ten years. Yet the gap in expectancy of life without ill health is 20. And those at the bottom of such ranges tend not to volunteer for medical studies. Dr Ali is obsessed by ensuring that they do. Which is why those yellow vans are drawing up in the car parks of Tesco, Asda, Lidl and Morrisons. \u201cNot Waitrose.\u201d Medical trials don\u2019t need more Waitrose shoppers. \nAs the rain falls, Dr Ali welcomes volunteers in. The NHS\u2019s size is its great weakness\u2014it is unwieldy and all but impossible to reform\u2014but also its strength. The RECOVERY trial, which found that a cheap steroid cut covid deaths by a third, yielded a result within 100 days. Sir Martin Landray, a professor of epidemiology at Oxford who ran RECOVERY and now runs Protas, a not-for-profit founded to improve clinical trials tackling common conditions, says that in its breadth (almost 70m people) and length of coverage (from cradle to grave) the NHS is \u201calmost unique\u2026The opportunities are really enormous.\u201d\nOur Future Health is trying to make the most of them. Each volunteer will generate hundreds of data points for researchers immediately; billions when their genomes are sequenced. That data will be married to their NHS data; AI will be used to crunch the lot. Then the work will begin: volunteers will (if they wish) be told what conditions they are at risk of and, for certain conditions (some cancers, diabetes, heart disease) be put on NHS pathways, for more tests and, if necessary, treatment.\nIt will not be perfect: inevitably there will be false positives and consequent anxiety. It remains to be seen whether the NHS\u2014a cantankerous, intransigent 75-year-old patient\u2014will accept its medicine. Dr Ali is optimistic: \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to see how the study could fail.\u201d And in Watford and in Grimsby and in Manchester, volunteers queue, and roll up their sleeves. Some to help the NHS. Some to help themselves. Some to help both. Because we are all in this together. For now. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.", "description": "It is aimed at saving Britons\u2014and the
