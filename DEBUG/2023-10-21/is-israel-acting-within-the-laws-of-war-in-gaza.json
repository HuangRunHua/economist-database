Israeli jets and artillery have been pounding the coastal enclave. \u201cThe scenes out of Gaza will be hard to stomach,\u201d warned a spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on October 12th. Hamas, which has deliberately massacred civilians, and whose founding charter commits it to the destruction of Israel, is undoubtedly guilty of war crimes. How far can Israel go in response? \nRead more on the war between Israel and Hamas\nIsrael faces the danger of fighting on a second front\nFear and anger rises on the West Bank\nAll of our coverage of Israel and Hamas\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s initial actions have prompted a wave of criticism. B\u2019tselem, an Israeli human-rights group, has accused Israel of \u201ca criminal policy of revenge\u201d, arguing that the scale of its air strikes and blockade constitute \u201cwar crimes openly ordered by top Israeli officials\u201d. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, a humanitarian organisation, has accused Israel of unlawful \u201ccollective punishment\u201d of Gaza \u201cin the form of total siege, indiscriminate bombing, and the pending threat of a ground battle.\u201d\nIn practice, though, international law and the specific rules that govern warfare\u2014the law of armed conflict (LOAC), also known as international humanitarian law (IHL)\u2014give Israel considerable latitude to attack Hamas, according to legal experts. Article 51 of the United Nations charter gives states the right of self-defence against armed attack, provided that, according to customary international law, the force they use is necessary and proportionate. Proportionality does not mean symmetry in the type of weapons used or the number of casualties caused. It means that the defending state can use as much force as is needed to address the threat\u2014and no more.\n\nDrawing that line is a subjective and contentious process. But Israel\u2019s campaign so far would meet those criteria, argues Aurel Sari, a law professor at the University of Exeter who lectures to NATO armed forces. The scale of Hamas\u2019s attack, its demonstrated intent and proven capability means that invading Gaza or even occupying it temporarily to destroy the group \u201cwill be relatively easy to justify\u201d legally, he says.\nNonetheless, some measures are particularly contentious. Israel, helped by Egypt, which controls a southern crossing, has maintained a ground, air and naval blockade of Gaza for years, with only some goods and people permitted to cross. Sieges and blockades are not in themselves illegal. But on October 9th Yoav Gallant, Israel\u2019s defence minister, said that would turn into a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d, with \u201cno electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed\u201d. Three days later Israel Katz, the energy minister, warned that no \u201celectrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter\u201d until Hamas freed hostages.\nIsraeli officials justify this move on the basis that Hamas diverts civilian goods for military use. \u201cClearly\u201d says Amichai Cohen, a law professor at the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, \u201cthere is some level of supply that Israel should allow. The question is whether Israel should provide electricity to areas which are clearly controlled by Hamas, and where Hamas will use the electricity in order to attack Israel.\u201d Others, such as Tom Dannenbaum, a law professor at Tufts University in Boston, argue that Mr Gallant\u2019s order plainly violates a prohibition on starving civilians\u2014even if the goal is to squeeze Hamas. That may be one reason why, despite Mr Gallant\u2019s combative rhetoric, Israeli officials are privately working with Egypt to ensure that some supplies can come in from the south. \n\nA second source of legal dispute is the IDF\u2019s decision, late in the evening of October 12th, to tell 1.1m civilians living in the northern part of Gaza to move south. (Hamas called on civilians to ignore the call.) The grave humanitarian consequences of this decision are not in doubt. Gaza\u2019s infrastructure is in ruins and there are few places for so many people to go. But the legal aspects are more complicated. \nLawyers distinguish between temporary evacuation of civilians in warzones, which can be lawful, and permanent displacement, where the intent is to prevent them from returning, which is not. However the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a humanitarian group, says that the evacuation instructions, combined with the siege, \u201care not compatible with international humanitarian law\u201d. It is also not always safe to move while the bombardment continues. Video footage verified by the Washington Post showed a number of people including several children who had been killed, apparently by an Israeli strike while they were fleeing to the south on Friday.  \nThe question of evacuation is tangled up with the specific conditions of Gaza, where Hamas is deeply intermingled with the civilian population. IHL, which governs the conduct of armies once they are waging a war, demands that soldiers distinguish between combatants and military objects on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other. Targeting the latter on purpose is always illegal. But an attack that kills civilians\u2014even lots of them\u2014can be legal if it is necessary for some military purpose and proportional \u201cin relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated\u201d. \nIsrael\u2019s targeting is \u201cbroadly within the mainstream of contemporary state practice\u201d and in line with American doctrine, argued Michael Schmitt of the University of Reading and Lieutenant-Colonel John Merriam, a US Army Judge Advocate, in papers published after they visited the IDF\u2019s headquarters and studied its procedures shortly after Operation Protective Edge, Israel\u2019s 50-day war on Hamas in 2014.\nBut the same legal principles, even interpreted in broadly the same way, can result in different and sometimes jarring outcomes because of local circumstances. Hamas\u2019s large rocket force, capable of striking most of Israel, means that the anticipated \u201cmilitary advantage\u201d of attacks is seen to be high, note Mr Schmitt and Lt-Col Merriam. That can justify, in the IDF\u2019s view, high levels of collateral damage that would appear excessive to an army whose civilian population did not face a comparable threat\u2014though, conversely, the effectiveness of the country\u2019s Iron Dome missile-defence system can have the opposite legal effect. Similarly, Israel\u2019s conscript-heavy armed forces are casualty averse and sensitive to soldiers being taken prisoner. That can result in a greater reliance on firepower.\nHamas\u2019s way of war also plays a role in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s not a regular city,\u201d argues Avichai Mandelblit, who served as Israel\u2019s chief military advocate general (MAG) from 2004 to 2011 and attorney-general from 2016 to 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s a military city. There are thousands of legal military targets inside the neighbourhoods of Gaza. You cannot distinguish them.\u201d Israel\u2019s war aim is to destroy Hamas. \u201cIf you want to do it,\u201d says Mr Mandelblit, \u201cthen you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas.\u201d Evacuation of civilians is thus unavoidable, he says. \u201cThere is no other way\u2014the other way is they\u2019re going to be killed.\u201d \nThe law nonetheless demands discrimination. Each target must be judged individually. But the scale of Israel\u2019s bombardment\u20146,000 bombs dropped in six days, compared with 2,000 to 5,000 per month across Iraq and Syria during the American-led air campaign against Islamic State from 2014 to 2019\u2014has given rise to concern that the definition of military targets is being stretched to breaking-point. \u201cIt is very hard to see a legal basis for many of these strikes,\u201d argues Adil Haque of Rutgers Law School in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that all of these buildings were in active use by Hamas when they were levelled, or that their military value would outweigh the foreseeable harm to civilians in or near them.\u201d \nMr Sari says that the IDF, in his experience, is \u201cworld-class\u201d in its legal expertise and professional ethics. \u201cI have a lot of faith in the Israeli military, lawyers and their system. It is very robust.\u201d Military lawyers are present at Israeli military headquarters from the brigade-level up to advise on targeting. \u201cEvery target is legally examined,\u201d insists Mr Mandelblit. Legal policy is set by the MAG and civilian attorney general together, with the latter getting the last word.\nBut this system is likely to face its greatest test in the weeks ahead. On October 10th an Israeli official told a television station: \u201cGaza will eventually turn into a city of tents. There will be no buildings.\u201d Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson, boasted that \u201chundreds of tons of bombs\u201d had been dropped on Gaza. Then, he added: \u201cthe emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy.\u201d Neither statement can be squared with the law. \n\nMajor acts of terrorism can unmoor even the most professional armed forces. America engaged in torture after 9/11. American, Australian and British special forces have all faced allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. A video published on October 10th appears to show Israeli troops executing Palestinian gunmen who were on their knees and waving a flag of surrender. \u201cIf you send tens of thousands of conscript soldiers on a revenge mission into a dense urban area that civilians can\u2019t leave, the results are entirely predictable,\u201d warns Jack McDonald of the Department of War Studies at King\u2019s College London. \nRestraints that applied in previous military operations may not apply in this war. Mr Mandelblit gives the example of the IDF\u2019s policy of giving prior warning for some strikes. Armies are generally obliged to provide warning of attacks when they can, though not if surprise is essential. \u201cYou cannot do it in such a war,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more like Lebanon now,\u201d he says, alluding to Israel\u2019s war with Hizbullah, the militant group, in 2006. \u201cAll we can say to civilians is: look, go away from your cities or your homes, where Hamas is mixed.\u201d The IDF has already abandoned its earlier practice of \u201croof knocks\u201d\u2014the use of smaller bombs a few minutes ahead of larger strikes\u2014in favour of general warnings to entire neighbourhoods. \nIsrael\u2019s war has acquired an existential quality. \u201cThis time it\u2019s going to be a war to the end,\u201d says Mr Mandelblit. \u201cIt\u2019s either us or them because we know what they\u2019re going to do to us.\u201d Yet Mr Cohen warns that the law is not the only consideration in waging war. \u201cThe fact that a lot of children in Gaza, Palestinian children, will die in an attack\u2014even if it\u2019s legal\u2014is destructive for Israel\u2019s legitimacy around the world.\u201d \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"},

"Article", "articleBody": "MORE THAN 1,900 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza since October 7th, when Hamas terrorists murdered 1,300 people in southern Israel. Israeli jets and artillery have been pounding the coastal enclave. \u201cThe scenes out of Gaza will be hard to stomach,\u201d warned a spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on October 12th. Hamas, which has deliberately massacred civilians, and whose founding charter commits it to the destruction of Israel, is undoubtedly guilty of war crimes. How far can Israel go in response? \nRead more on the war between Israel and Hamas\nIsrael faces the danger of fighting on a second front\nFear and anger rises on the West Bank\nAll of our coverage of Israel and Hamas\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s initial actions have prompted a wave of criticism. B\u2019tselem, an Israeli human-rights group, has accused Israel of \u201ca criminal policy of revenge\u201d, arguing that the scale of its air strikes and blockade constitute \u201cwar crimes openly ordered by top Israeli officials\u201d. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, a humanitarian organisation, has accused Israel of unlawful \u201ccollective punishment\u201d of Gaza \u201cin the form of total siege, indiscriminate bombing, and the pending threat of a ground battle.\u201d\nIn practice, though, international law and the specific rules that govern warfare\u2014the law of armed conflict (LOAC), also known as international humanitarian law (IHL)\u2014give Israel considerable latitude to attack Hamas, according to legal experts. Article 51 of the United Nations charter gives states the right of self-defence against armed attack, provided that, according to customary international law, the force they use is necessary and proportionate. Proportionality does not mean symmetry in the type of weapons used or the number of casualties caused. It means that the defending state can use as much force as is needed to address the threat\u2014and no more.\n\nDrawing that line is a subjective and contentious process. But Israel\u2019s campaign so far would meet those criteria, argues Aurel Sari, a law professor at the University of Exeter who lectures to NATO armed forces. The scale of Hamas\u2019s attack, its demonstrated intent and proven capability means that invading Gaza or even occupying it temporarily to destroy the group \u201cwill be relatively easy to justify\u201d legally, he says.\nNonetheless, some measures are particularly contentious. Israel, helped by Egypt, which controls a southern crossing, has maintained a ground, air and naval blockade of Gaza for years, with only some goods and people permitted to cross. Sieges and blockades are not in themselves illegal. But on October 9th Yoav Gallant, Israel\u2019s defence minister, said that would turn into a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d, with \u201cno electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed\u201d. Three days later Israel Katz, the energy minister, warned that no \u201celectrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter\u201d until Hamas freed hostages.\nIsraeli officials justify this move on the basis that Hamas diverts civilian goods for military use. \u201cClearly\u201d says Amichai Cohen, a law professor at the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem, \u201cthere is some level of supply that Israel should allow. The question is whether Israel should provide electricity to areas which are clearly controlled by Hamas, and where Hamas will use the electricity in order to attack Israel.\u201d Others, such as Tom Dannenbaum, a law professor at Tufts University in Boston, argue that Mr Gallant\u2019s order plainly violates a prohibition on starving civilians\u2014even if the goal is to squeeze Hamas. That may be one reason why, despite Mr Gallant\u2019s combative rhetoric, Israeli officials are privately working with Egypt to ensure that some supplies can come in from the south. \n\nA second source of legal dispute is the IDF\u2019s decision, late in the evening of October 12th, to tell 1.1m civilians living in the northern part of Gaza to move south. (Hamas called on civilians to ignore the call.) The grave humanitarian consequences of this decision are not in doubt. Gaza\u2019s infrastructure is in ruins and there are few places for so many people to go. But the legal aspects are more complicated. \nLawyers distinguish between temporary evacuation of civilians in warzones, which can be lawful, and permanent displacement, where the intent is to prevent them from returning, which is not. However the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a humanitarian group, says that the evacuation instructions, combined with the siege, \u201care not compatible with international humanitarian law\u201d. It is also not always safe to move while the bombardment continues. Video footage verified by the Washington Post showed a number of people including several children who had been killed, apparently by an Israeli strike while they were fleeing to the south on Friday.  \nThe question of evacuation is tangled up with the specific conditions of Gaza, where Hamas is deeply intermingled with the civilian population. IHL, which governs the conduct of armies once they are waging a war, demands that soldiers distinguish between combatants and military objects on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other. Targeting the latter on purpose is always illegal. But an attack that kills civilians\u2014even lots of them\u2014can be legal if it is necessary for some military purpose and proportional \u201cin relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated\u201d. \nIsrael\u2019s targeting is \u201cbroadly within the mainstream of contemporary state practice\u201d and in line with American doctrine, argued Michael Schmitt of the University of Reading and Lieutenant-Colonel John Merriam, a US Army Judge Advocate, in papers published after they visited the IDF\u2019s headquarters and studied its procedures shortly after Operation Protective Edge, Israel\u2019s 50-day war on Hamas in 2014.\nBut the same legal principles, even interpreted in broadly the same way, can result in different and sometimes jarring outcomes because of local circumstances. Hamas\u2019s large rocket force, capable of striking most of Israel, means that the anticipated \u201cmilitary advantage\u201d of attacks is seen to be high, note Mr Schmitt and Lt-Col Merriam. That can justify, in the IDF\u2019s view, high levels of collateral damage that would appear excessive to an army whose civilian population did not face a comparable threat\u2014though, conversely, the effectiveness of the country\u2019s Iron Dome missile-defence system can have the opposite legal effect. Similarly, Israel\u2019s conscript-heavy armed forces are casualty averse and sensitive to soldiers being taken prisoner. That can result in a greater reliance on firepower.\nHamas\u2019s way of war also plays a role in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s not a regular city,\u201d argues Avichai Mandelblit, who served as Israel\u2019s chief military advocate general (MAG) from 2004 to 2011 and attorney-general from 2016 to 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s a military city. There are thousands of legal military targets inside the neighbourhoods of Gaza. You cannot distinguish them.\u201d Israel\u2019s war aim is to destroy Hamas. \u201cIf you want to do it,\u201d says Mr Mandelblit, \u201cthen you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas.\u201d Evacuation of civilians is thus unavoidable, he says. \u201cThere is no other way\u2014the other way is they\u2019re going to be killed.\u201d \nThe law nonetheless demands discrimination. Each target must be judged individually. But the scale of Israel\u2019s bombardment\u20146,000 bombs dropped in six days, compared with 2,000 to 5,000 per month across Iraq and Syria during the American-led air campaign against Islamic State from 2014 to 2019\u2014has given rise to concern that the definition of military targets is being stretched to breaking-point. \u201cIt is very hard to see a legal basis for many of these strikes,\u201d argues Adil Haque of Rutgers Law School in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that all of these buildings were in active use by Hamas when they were levelled, or that their military value would outweigh the foreseeable harm to civilians in or near them.\u201d \nMr Sari says that the IDF, in his experience, is \u201cworld-class\u201d in its legal expertise and professional ethics. \u201cI have a lot of faith in the Israeli military, lawyers and their system. It is very robust.\u201d Military lawyers are present at Israeli military headquarters from the brigade-level up to advise on targeting. \u201cEvery target is legally examined,\u201d insists Mr Mandelblit. Legal policy is set by the MAG and civilian attorney general together, with the latter getting the last word.\nBut this system is likely to face its greatest test in the weeks ahead. On October 10th an Israeli official told a television station: \u201cGaza will eventually turn into a city of tents. There will be no buildings.\u201d Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson, boasted that \u201chundreds of tons of bombs\u201d had been dropped on Gaza. Then, he added: \u201cthe emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy.\u201d Neither statement can be squared with the law. \n\nMajor acts of terrorism can unmoor even the most professional armed forces. America engaged in torture after 9/11. American, Australian and British special forces have all faced allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. A video published on October 10th appears to show Israeli troops executing Palestinian gunmen who were on their knees and waving a flag of surrender. \u201cIf you send tens of thousands of conscript soldiers on a revenge mission into a dense urban area that civilians can\u2019t leave, the results are entirely predictable,\u201d warns Jack McDonald of the Department of War Studies at King\u2019s College London. \nRestraints that applied in previous military operations may not apply in this war. Mr Mandelblit gives the example of the IDF\u2019s policy of giving prior warning for some strikes. Armies are generally obliged to provide warning of attacks when they can, though not if surprise is essential. \u201cYou cannot do it in such a war,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more like Lebanon now,\u201d he says, alluding to Israel\u2019s war with Hizbullah, the militant group, in 2006. \u201cAll we can say to civilians is: look, go away from your cities or your homes, where Hamas is mixed.\u201d The IDF has already abandoned its earlier practice of \u201croof knocks\u201d\u2014the use of smaller bombs a few minutes ahead of larger strikes\u2014in favour of general warnings to entire neighbourhoods. \nIsrael\u2019s war has acquired an existential quality. \u201cThis time it\u2019s going to be a war to the end,\u201d says Mr Mandelblit. \u201cIt\u2019s either us or them because we know what they\u2019re going to do to us.\u201d Yet Mr Cohen warns that the law is not the only consideration in waging war. \u201cThe fact that a lot of children in Gaza, Palestinian children, will die in an attack\u2014even if it\u2019s legal\u2014is destructive for Israel\u2019s legitimacy around the world.\u201d \u25a0", "description": "Even lawful evacuations and attacks on
