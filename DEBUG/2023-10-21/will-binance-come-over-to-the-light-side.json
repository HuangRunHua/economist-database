"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/19/will-binance-come-over-to-the-light-side", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "\u201cThe luke skywalker and the Darth Vader of crypto.\u201d That is how Michael Lewis, author of \u201cGoing Infinite\u201d, a recent book about the rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of ftx, a now-bankrupt crypto exchange, is supposed to have described the intense rivalry between his subject and Changpeng Zhao (pictured), the boss of Binance, a rival firm. \nUntil Mr Bankman-Fried\u2019s exchange collapsed with an $8bn hole in its balance-sheet, the analogy seemed apt. The two men controlled the two largest crypto exchanges in the world. Both were known by acronyms: \u201csbf\u201d and \u201ccz\u201d. Young, talented and seemingly in favour of playing nice with regulators, sbf was something of a wunderkind, and cz was his shadowy foil. Keen to avoid being pinned down by national laws, his exchange was based \u201cnowhere\u201d. Binance had long been under investigation for possible money-laundering and criminal-sanctions violations by America\u2019s justice department. cz had invested in ftx before the two turned on each other. Then sbf publicly goaded cz about his legal problems, and a tweet by cz probably helped set off the run on ftx.\n\nNow, with ftx out of the picture and sbf on trial, charged with various kinds of fraud, which he denies, cz looks a lot like the last man standing in crypto. Binance utterly dominates crypto trading (see chart). A whopping 40-50% of it by volume takes place on the platform. The big question, which cz discussed in an interview with The Economist in Bahrain on October 11th, is how Binance will now evolve. \nFor as long as crypto exchanges have existed, financial laws have been ill-suited to them. Given the nature of the assets that are traded, they are in effect hybrids of exchanges, brokers and settlement firms. If crypto exchanges were largely unregulated that was at least partly because few laws had been written to govern them.\nBut, in the wake of ftx\u2019s collapse, the situation is starting to change. Legislators and regulators around the world are rushing to pen new laws or crack down on the industry. This has two big implications for exchanges. First, regulators want to make sure that they are not mishandling or improperly using customer funds, as ftx did. Second, they want to ensure that exchanges are not facilitating financial crimes.\ncz insists that customers can trust his exchange. \u201cThere are so many ways\u201d Binance is structured differently to ftx, he says. The firm has met heavy redemption requests from clients, including in choppy markets. He points out that the Securities and Exchange Commission (sec), America\u2019s financial regulator, spent a long time investigating Binance for this kind of misconduct. The regulator could provide \u201czero evidence\u201d that Binance was commingling user funds, says cz, \u201cwhich actually helps us to prove that we don\u2019t do it.\u201d Other complaints by the sec, including that the company issued securities without a licence, are still to be heard in court.\nYet it is the second requirement that might turn out to be trickier for Binance. In December Reuters, a news service, reported that prosecutors at America\u2019s justice department were split on whether or not to charge the firm with money-laundering or sanctions violations. According to Bloomberg, another news service, Binance withdrew its application to become a licensed exchange in Singapore in 2021, where it was based at the time, in part owing to its inability to comply with strict anti-money laundering rules. The sec quotes evidence from a former employee, who admitted that the company thought it was an \u201cunlicensed securities exchange\u201d and \u201cdid not want to be regulated, ever\u201d.\ncz dismisses this as \u201cprivate chat by an ex-employee\u201d, and adds it \u201cwas not the right thing by far\u201d. He notes that Binance is \u201cthe most licensed crypto firm in the world\u201d, with permission to operate in 18 countries across Asia, Europe and the Middle East (its American arm operates in 44 states). Binance now appears to be playing nice with various authorities. A spokesperson confirms that in recent days it has frozen \u201cthe small number of accounts\u201d soliciting donations in support of Hamas, to comply with international sanctions laws.\nThe test for the firm now will be in Europe. America is cracking down on crypto, and is unlikely to pass new laws soon. By contrast, European legislators have written a \u201cMarkets in Crypto-Assets\u201d or \u201cmica\u201d framework, which entered into force in June. Exchanges can keep operating under existing licences until 2026, unless refused under mica, which will require strong policies against money-laundering and terrorist financing. cz says that, in addition to such policies, a full licence means that authorities look at \u201cyour wallet infrastructure, your security, your customer support policies, your refund policy. They look at your whole business.\u201d \nA crypto exchange can no longer argue that it cannot comply with national rules because they do not exist. Failing to meet Europe\u2019s standards would reveal that Binance does not want, or is unable, to follow even clear laws. In \u201cStar Wars\u201d, Yoda warns Luke Skywalker that it is easier to amass or wield power by turning to the Dark Side. It is harder to operate in the light. \u25a0\nFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.",
