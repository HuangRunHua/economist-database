has shown a steady hand in the Gaza crisis", "section": "United States", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url":

He vents it sometimes on aides when he is unhappy with their work, and occasionally even on voters who have the nerve to criticise him. But when it comes to building relationships to achieve his goals over the long term, whether with a wayward legislator or an oppositional foreign leader, Mr Biden has long demonstrated unusual patience and forbearance. \nSo it was in 2010 when, as Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president, he landed in Israel only to be blindsided by an announcement from the government of Binyamin Netanyahu that, contrary to the wishes of the Americans, it intended to expand Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem. This seemed a deliberate humiliation, and some of President Obama\u2019s aides thought Mr Biden should turn around and head home in protest. But Mr Biden had begun developing a relationship with Mr Netanyahu in the 1980s, when he arrived in Washington to serve at the Israeli embassy, and the vice-president had his own ideas of how to manage matters.\nMr Biden issued a statement criticising the move, then put together a joint working group with Mr Netanyahu to contain the fallout. Then he and his wife Jill went to dinner with the Netanyahus. According to Mr Netanyahu\u2019s own grateful account, Mr Biden spoke that night about deeply personal matters, about how hard it had been to overcome the deaths of his first wife and their daughter in a car crash. Mr Biden later gave the prime minister a photograph, scrawling a message on it that might serve as an epigram for much of the US-Israel relationship: \u201cBibi, I don\u2019t agree with a damn thing you say, but I love ya.\u201d \nSince Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th, Americans have got the steady leadership most of them voted for in 2020, and they have been reminded of the pettiness and volatility they rejected. Donald Trump, who has not forgiven Mr Netanyahu for congratulating Mr Biden on winning in 2020, lashed out at the prime minister, while Republicans in the House struggled to show they could govern themselves, let alone a country. As Republicans bickered over who would be speaker, their foreign-policy message became increasingly muddled, if not contradictory\u2014critical of Mr Biden for endangering America by not helping Israel stand up to the menace of Iran, yet also critical of Mr Biden for endangering America by helping Europe stand up to the menace of Russia.\nMr Biden has followed his own playbook. In May 2021, when Hamas barraged Israel with rockets from Gaza, he did not call for restraint or a ceasefire, as past presidents probably would have. Rather than try to box in Mr Netanyahu publicly, a step that could backfire, he voiced support for Israeli air strikes, while in phone calls over eleven days he questioned the prime minister about his strategy, to show him he had no clear endgame, according to \u201cThe Last Politician\u201d, a new book on the Biden presidency by Franklin Foer. On the fourth call, as Mr Netanyahu continued insisting the Israeli operation was not done, the president told him time was up. \u201cHey man, we\u2019re out of runway here,\u201d Mr Biden said, according to Mr Foer. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Mr Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire.\nMichael Oren, who as Israel\u2019s ambassador in Washington during most of the Obama years relied on Vice-President Biden to be his point of contact, says Mr Biden\u2019s connection with Mr Netanyahu is less about chemistry than history\u2014their own shared past, and Israel\u2019s. Mr Biden \u201cremembers the six-day war, he remembers the \u201973 war,\u201d Mr Oren says. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying, \u2018He has Israel in his heart.\u2019 It\u2019s very personal with him.\u201d\nThat is less and less true generally of Democrats, who have their own divisions over foreign policy. Some on the party\u2019s benighted leftist fringe celebrated the massacre of Israeli civilians, and members of the growing anti-Israel faction of House Democrats began almost immediately calling for a ceasefire. Mr Biden recognised this would be not just a political impossibility for Israel, but a strategic and moral one. \nYet while Mr Biden has been forthright that Israel has not just a right but \u201ca duty\u201d to defend itself, he has also been deft in urging restraint. In a speech three days after the Hamas assault, he said he and Mr Netanyahu had discussed \u201chow democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law.\u201d The American president had not demanded anything, in other words; the two leaders had instead recommitted themselves to a shared value.\nPalestinians have politics, too\nNow comes the hard part, of course. Gazans are already suffering and dying under Israeli siege and bombardment, and a ground invasion will cause far more agony, as Hamas hopes. (Gazan civilians may be prisoners of Israel, but they are also hostages of Hamas.) And an invasion will increase the chance of a wider war. Mr Biden\u2019s judgment and ability to influence Mr Netanyahu are in for a severe test. \nAnd just as, once this crisis eases, Mr Netanyahu will face a reckoning for Israel\u2019s failures of intelligence and operations, Mr Biden\u2019s Middle East policy deserves scrutiny. His decision to ease pressure on Iran and his attempt at a benign neglect of the Israel-Palestine conflict have ended in violence, albeit violence that has been a long time coming. \nOne can draw a line to this war in Gaza from the moment in 2006 when Condoleezza Rice, then secretary of state, glanced up at the television news from her elliptical trainer and learned, to her shock, that Hamas had won elections in Gaza that she had been promoting as spreading democracy in the Middle East. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, that\u2019s not right,\u2019\u201d Ms Rice later told a biographer, Elisabeth Bumiller. Four successive American administrations have paid too little attention to the miseries of Palestinian life and the realities of Palestinian politics. They have failed to buttress Palestinian institutions and reform-minded Palestinian leaders. A true friend of Israel would not make that mistake again. \u25a0\nRead more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics:\nJoe Biden should admit Republicans are (partly) right about border security (Oct 12th)\nWhat America should really learn from Dianne Feinstein (Oct 5th)\nA Trump Party in the Reagan Library (Sep 28th)\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.
