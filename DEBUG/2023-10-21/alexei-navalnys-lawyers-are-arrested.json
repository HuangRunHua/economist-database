lawyers are arrested", "section": "Europe", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/alexei-navalnys-lawyers-are-arrested", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Alexei Navalny, Russia\u2019s best-known opposition leader, has been in captivity for more than 1,000 days, and in solitary confinement for 224 of them. He was denied medical treatment when ill, has been refused visits by his family for more than a year and is not allowed to make telephone calls. Yet Mr Navalny, ever stoical, has described his imprisonment not as martyrdom, but as a nuisance and a challenge that needs to be overcome. \nThe challenges continue to mount. In August Mr Navalny was sentenced to an additional 19 years in prison for \u201cextremism\u201d on top of the eleven-and-a-half years he was already serving for \u201cfraud\u201d. But even then he continued to communicate with his supporters and to haunt Vladimir Putin, whose thugs tried to poison him in 2020 and then subjected him to torturous conditions in jail when he returned to Russia the following year after being treated in Germany. Mr Navalny\u2019s rare appearances in courts (mostly via video link) have turned into political speeches, and visits by his lawyers have kept him in touch with the outside world. \u201cHis voice from behind bars sounded unbearably loud for Putin,\u201d Leonid Volkov, Mr Navalny\u2019s chief of staff, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) from Vilnius, Lithuania\u2019s capital.\nSo Mr Putin decided to turn down the volume, and to deprive Mr Navalny of his last channel of communication. On October 13th three of Mr Navalny\u2019s lawyers\u2014Vadim Kobzev, Alexei Liptser (pictured) and Igor Sergunin\u2014were arrested and accused of \u201cparticipation in an extremist community\u201d; that is, of passing Mr Navalny\u2019s words to the outside world. Olga Mikhailova, another of his lawyers, had left the country by the time her offices were raided. \nMr Navalny learned the news from a journalist during one of his appeal hearings. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. My lawyer is not here. All the other lawyers are not here. Nobody is allowed to visit me. I am isolated and cut off from any information,\u201d he told the judge. Even the radio in his cell has been turned off, he said, to plunge him into complete silence. Shortly after that, news came that Mr Navalny\u2019s fifth lawyer, who was supposed to attend the appeal hearing, had fled the country. \nThe practice of jailing not only dissidents but also their lawyers has been tried and tested in Belarus, but is relatively new in Russia. Some 200 Russian defence lawyers have signed a petition denouncing the climate of fear in which they operate, and calling for a strike. Two volunteers have now come forward to help Mr Navalny.\nHaving no legal representation and no contact with the outside world makes Mr Navalny especially vulnerable, as he has been awaiting a transfer to one of Russia\u2019s toughest prisons for a year. (\u201cI feel like a tired rock star on the verge of depression. I\u2019ve reached the top of the charts and there\u2019s nothing more to strive for,\u201d he joked when he heard of his transfer order.)\nAll this is part of the Kremlin\u2019s preparation for next March\u2019s presidential election, which is sure to be farcical. Mr Putin will aim to demonstrate total political control and to keep his opponents demoralised. A few hours after losing his lawyers, Mr Navalny somehow managed to convey that by January 15th he will produce his strategy for how best to tackle Mr Putin\u2019s election, though it is not clear how he will now be able to communicate it. \u201cPrison exists only in your mind,\u201d Mr Navalny wrote in one of his early posts. If so, he remains the freest man in Russia. \u25a0", "description": "Vladimir Putin\u2019s latest act of persecution", "ogDescription": "Vladimir Putin\u2019s latest act of persecution", "imageUrl":
