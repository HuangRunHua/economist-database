MAKE an intriguing pair of rivals: he in a dark suit and porkpie hat, she in a gingham dress and matching hair bow. His domain is a vast scientific-research facility in New Mexico; hers is a fluorescent-pink party house with a slide. J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy, an Irish actor) spends his days corralling the finest scientific minds in America to create a nuclear bomb\u2014work a colleague calls \u201cthe most important fucking thing to ever happen in the history of the world\u201d. Barbie (played by Margot Robbie, an Australian actress) may seem like she has the perfect life, but she has existential worries too. Do her friends and fellow dolls, she wonders, \u201cever think about dying?\u201d\nNo recent movie matchup has been as eagerly awaited as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d. Released on July 21st in America and Britain, the two films will serve as a test of whether viewers can be coaxed off their couches to return to cinemas. The incongruity in the films\u2019 subject and tone has delighted the internet. People have created memes, remixed the trailers into jarring \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d hybrids and debated whether to see the biographical drama or the fantasy comedy first. \nThe brouhaha is partly a result of the film-makers. Christopher Nolan, the writer-director of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d, is the closest thing Hollywood has to a mad scientist. He shoots on film and mostly eschews computer-generated imagery, blowing up an actual Boeing 747 for a previous film. The nuclear reactions in \u201cOppenheimer\u201d were also created by producing actual explosions (albeit not nuclear ones), brightened by aluminium and magnesium powder. His films toy with narrative conventions and tricksy subjects, such as the unconscious mind and theoretical astrophysics. They have earned a combined total of around $5bn in ticket sales; \u201cDunkirk\u201d, released in 2017, is one of the highest-grossing films ever made about the second world war.\nGreta Gerwig, the director and co-writer of \u201cBarbie\u201d, has her own large fan club. She started out in the \u201cmumblecore\u201d genre of independent film (so named for its focus on dialogue) but has since had hits with \u201cLady Bird\u201d (2017) and an adaptation of \u201cLittle Women\u201d (2019). Her work claims humbler gross ticket sales of $300m. For \u201cBarbie\u201d, she has cited old Hollywood musicals and films about the afterlife, such as \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d (1943), as inspiration.\nThe two films encapsulate some of the caprices of the modern movie industry. \u201cBarbie\u201d is one of many productions to exploit decades-old intellectual property. Mattel, a toymaker, has sold roughly a billion dolls since it first introduced Barbara Millicent Roberts (call her \u201cBarbie\u201d) to consumers in 1959. Ms Robbie, who is also a producer of the film, has said she was drawn to the project because the Barbie name is \u201cmore globally recognised than practically everything else other than Coca-Cola\u201d. It is easy to imagine that a sequel is already in the works. \n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d, by contrast, holds no such franchise potential. The scientist may be \u201cone of history\u2019s most essential and paradoxical\u201d figures, as Mr Nolan has put it, but he is not likely to return for \u201cOppenheimer 2: Learning to Love the Bomb\u201d. It is a serious, standalone drama\u2014the kind of film made less frequently as studios focus on sequels and spin-offs. Its opening weekend is predicted to fetch $40m-50m in ticket sales, compared with around $80m for \u201cBarbie\u201d. \nThough \u201cOppenheimer\u201d features stars such as Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, the sombre story is not obviously a crowd-pleaser. That it has also been made with a large budget of $100m reflects the faith that studios have in certain film-makers and the risks they allow them to take. \u201cThere have been films previously about the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s and 1950s, and they haven\u2019t been box-office successes,\u201d says Sheldon Hall, a film historian and co-author of the book \u201cEpics, Spectacles and Blockbusters: A Hollywood History\u201d. \u201cThis film is being hinged on Nolan\u2019s reputation,\u201d he adds.\nThe \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d rivalry brings a more serious question for the public: whether to favour realism or escapism. As war rages on in Europe, and countries including China and North Korea continue to develop their nuclear arsenals, the origin story of these weapons of mass destruction may feel too real and raw. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is not a film that will ease viewers\u2019 anxieties. It explores the physicist\u2019s concerns about the horrifying power of his weapon and other bombs; it also shows how the American government attempted to silence him when those opinions became politically unpopular. Oppenheimer has disturbing visions of the bomb\u2019s victims in excruciating pain, their skin peeling. \u201cSome people leave the movie absolutely devastated,\u201d Mr Nolan has said. \u201cThey can\u2019t speak.\u201d\nFrom Hiroshima to Barbie Land\nMs Gerwig\u2019s production is much more playful. She has described the set\u2014which contributed to a global shortage of pink paint\u2014as \u201ca dopamine generator\u201d. The film\u2019s tone is witty and slyly self-referential: it pokes fun at Mattel, here run by a team of men, and the vexed history of the toys. (The Barbies mistakenly assume that all women revere them as role models.) It has the kind of plot that only makes sense if a viewer does not think about it deeply.\n\u201cBarbie\u201d recognises the alluring comfort of dream worlds. At one point Weird Barbie, a doll that has been handed around and mistreated, offers Barbie a choice, symbolised by a high heel and a clunky Birkenstock sandal: \u201cYou can go back to your regular life, or you can know the truth about the universe.\u201d Barbie chooses the stiletto and is quickly chastised. \u201cYou have to want to know, OK? Do it again.\u201d\n\u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d offer another version of the Birkenstock-stiletto dilemma. History suggests more viewers will opt for escapism. During the Great Depression, many of the highest-grossing films were musicals or historical epics. The same was true during the second world war. Movies that did broach the subject of conflict, including \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d and \u201cSergeant York\u201d, were often set in the past; those that were contemporaneous, such as \u201cCasablanca\u201d, tended to tell love stories rather than tales of grisly combat. In 1968, at the height of the Vietnam war, the biggest movie in America was \u201cFunny Girl\u201d. In 2007, during the financial crisis, it was a film from the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise. \nDavid Thomson, another film historian and author, reckons that, at a time of economic strain, war and populism, viewers will not want to see a serious film as much as they will want to see a frivolous one. \u201cComedies have always done well at the movies,\u201d he says, because they do \u201csomething that the movies were made for, which is to reassure people and give them a couple of hours of escape from pretty big problems.\u201d Who wants reality when life in plastic is so fantastic? \u25a0\nFor more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter\nCorrection (July 15th 2023): An earlier version of this article had an incorrect figure for the budget for the film \u201cOppenheimer\u201d.
