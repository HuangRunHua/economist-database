graduation ceremony to the strains of Edward Elgar\u2019s \u201cPomp and Circumstance March No. 1\u201d is quintessentially American. As they did so in May, clad in violet-coloured gowns, students at the campus in Shanghai of New York University (NYU) may have reflected on the oddity of this cultural transplant: not just the music, but their whole experience as undergraduates. Relations between China and the West\u2014especially America\u2014are becoming increasingly tense. China is trying to purge its universities of liberal thinking. Yet here were nearly 400 students, about half of them Chinese, getting their bachelor\u2019s certificates from a Chinese outpost of American academe. \nSince Xi Jinping took over as China\u2019s leader in 2012, he has tightened controls over university education. Several liberal scholars have been dismissed. Lecturers have been ordered to stop using imported textbooks that are deemed to promote Western values. Universities have been told to become \u201cstrongholds of the Communist Party\u2019s leadership\u201d. Under Mr Xi, few students have dared to stage protests. But in November small demonstrations broke out in several cities, and on many campuses, over harsh covid-related lockdowns. Pro-government commentators accused \u201cforeign forces\u201d of stirring the unrest. It has surely made the party even more wary of Western influences. \nBut ventures such as NYU\u2019s in Shanghai seem a world apart. Some are even expanding. This year NYU\u2019s campus in the city\u2019s financial district, Pudong, moved to a glitzy new nine-storey building designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, a New York-based firm that also drew the blueprints for Pudong\u2019s most iconic skyscraper, the Shanghai World Financial Centre. It has twice as much classroom space as NYU Shanghai\u2019s previous location. In August Duke Kunshan University (DKU) in Kunshan, a city near Shanghai, is also due to move to new premises. The joint-venture campus\u2014involving Duke University in North Carolina, Wuhan University and Kunshan\u2019s government\u2014will cover more than 33 hectares, twice as large as the current one. In Suzhou, a nearby city, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University has 23,000 students, making it China\u2019s largest academic joint venture. Last year it opened an additional campus, with room for 10,000.  \nNYU Shanghai and DKU were founded around the start of Mr Xi\u2019s rule, and Liverpool\u2019s venture seven years earlier (following the pioneer in this field, the University of Nottingham, which launched a campus in the city of Ningbo in 2004). But even as Mr Xi grew increasingly anti-Western, more such ventures were introduced, albeit on a smaller scale. In all, well over half of China\u2019s more than 1,230 universities have co-operative projects with foreign or Hong Kong counterparts. Over the past decade, the number of such schemes\u2014most of them involving universities from English-speaking countries\u2014has increased by a third. They range from ten full-blown universities to a plethora of smaller ventures such as joint departments or institutes inside Chinese campuses. \nOne of China\u2019s aims is to boost the quality of its universities by helping them learn how foreigners run such institutions. Another is to help local governments fulfil their economic ambitions. It is no accident that several of the biggest ventures are located in Shanghai and cities nearby. Shanghai is the country\u2019s financial centre; its hinterland is a base of high-tech manufacturing. Officials hope that foreign universities will attract talent for such industries. \nCompared with enrolment in the rest of China\u2019s university system, the number of students in foreign-run programmes is small: fewer than 600,000, according to state media, or less than 2% of the total number of students in China. But that does not stop the party from worrying. Even though most of the joint ventures\u2019 students focus on subjects such as science and business that are unlikely to touch on politically sensitive topics, officials are nervous that foreign professors and their textbooks might spread heretical views. \nIn 2017 the central authorities issued a classified directive on \u201cparty building\u201d in foreign-run academic programmes. It said the venture\u2019s party chief (the Chinese partner always has one) should sit on the governing board. This was often the case already. At DKU, however, the party secretary did not have a voting right. Allowing her to vote could have changed the balance between the American and Chinese representatives, says Denis Simon, who was then DKU\u2019s executive vice-chancellor. It would have required rewriting the joint-venture agreement, he says. The Americans were not keen to do so. That issue \u201cwas never fully resolved\u201d. \nBut the party is getting twitchy. In 2020 Chongqing University of Education (which has numerous foreign partnerships) published its own guidelines for implementing the central government\u2019s directive. They clearly reflected the mood in Beijing. The university instructed that Chinese teachers and students in joint-venture arrangements should \u201cconsciously resist corrosion by all kinds of erroneous Western thoughts and decadent ideas\u201d.  Social media such as WeChat should be used to help \u201cmanage\u201d student party members during their periods of study abroad, it said. Party branches should \u201ckeep abreast of the thinking of students and teachers\u201d and use \u201csupervisors\u201d to monitor classes. \nThere have been ominous remarks, too, by Chinese staff in joint ventures. In 2021 a party official at the University of Liverpool\u2019s wrote that party committees should make sure no one with \u201cideological problems\u201d is appointed to faculty. They should \u201cresolutely stop the spread of erroneous thinking\u201d. The party chief of Nottingham Ningbo, in an interview that year with state media, said: \u201cIf the school makes mistakes on important issues such as ideology, then there is no value in the school\u2019s existence, and it needs to be closed.\u201d In 2018 Stephen Morgan, then a professor at Nottingham Ningbo (now retired), says he was pressed to step down from its board. He blames the party: he had written an online article critical of Mr Xi. \u201cA lot of the party people would not even look at me or say hello to me for at least a year,\u201d he says. \nThe vice-chancellor of NYU Shanghai, Jeffrey Lehman, remains stoical. \u201cWithin our academic community, academic freedom has been fully honoured,\u201d he says. \u201cAcademic freedom was the clear understanding from the very beginning. And if the Chinese government is ever no longer comfortable with that, we can shut down.\u201d Responding to the party official\u2019s remarks, the University of Liverpool said it was \u201cabsolutely committed to academic independence\u201d and the joint venture had \u201cfreedom of speech enshrined in its core values\u201d.\nFor all its fretting, China shows no sign of wanting to chase away prestigious university brands that have already established a high-profile presence. But Mr Morgan believes that no new ventures involving humanities or social sciences are likely to be approved. In March the government said that on Hainan, an island province, foreign universities specialising in such areas as engineering and medicine could set up campuses on their own\u2014unlike existing ventures, which must have a Chinese partner. A party secretary, however, will still be required on their boards. \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what
