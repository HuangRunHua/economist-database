Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/07/20/young-latin-americans-are-unusually-open-to-autocrats", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "In the latest edition of Latinobar\u00f3metro, an international poll in Latin America, respondents were asked to rate their approval of 17 named leaders on a scale of one to ten. In 15 of the 17 countries surveyed, Nayib Bukele, El Salvador\u2019s populist, autocratic president, got the highest score\u2014on a list that included Pope Francis and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president. Such broad international appeal has raised concern about the durability of liberal democracy in the region. Are Latin Americans outside El Salvador yearning for their own version of Mr Bukele?\nFirst conducted in 1995, Latinobar\u00f3metro is a leading source of region-wide data on Latin American public opinion. This year\u2019s poll, the first since 2020, was released on July 20th. Perhaps the most heartening result is that support for outright dictators remains scant. The two least-popular leaders in the survey were Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, who have both banned political opponents and held power by force for more than a decade. And just 17% of the 19,000 respondents agreed with the statement that \u201can authoritarian government can sometimes be preferable to a democratic one\u201d, a rate within the historical range of 12-19%.\n\nHowever, such questions reveal little about elected autocrats like Mr Bukele, who maintain the trappings of democracy while hollowing out its substance. And although this slipperiness makes their political potential hard to gauge using polls, the overall pattern in the new data is that the region is indeed becoming increasingly fertile territory for such figures.\nTwo questions in the survey addressed policies often implemented by illiberal leaders. Although 61% of respondents disagreed with the statement that \u201cin case of difficulties, it is good for the president to control the media\u201d, the 36% who agreed marked a record high. In 2010 just 26% of participants did so. On the question of whether a \u201cgovernment with an iron fist\u201d\u2014a term that usually means heavy-handed security policies that lead to violations of human rights, such as Mr Bukele\u2019s mass-incarceration strategy\u2014can \u201csolve our problems\u201d, the liberal side were in the majority by an even slimmer margin. Just 51% agreed with a statement that such a government could not solve problems, whereas 46% disagreed.\nAnother set of hypothetical questions suggested that the poor approval ratings for Mr Maduro and Mr Ortega might have more to do with their weak performance in areas like the economy and public safety than with their subversion of democracy. The share of respondents agreeing with the statement \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind if a non-democratic government took power, so long as it solved problems\u201d has been rising steadily during the past 20 years, from 45% in 2003 to 51% in 2020. This year, it reached a new high of 54%. Another grim record was the 35% of participants agreeing that \u201cI would support a military government replacing a democratic one if things got difficult.\u201d The previous maximum, in 2020, was 31%.\nThese regional averages conceal variation between countries. Support for democracy and opposition to authoritarianism is highest in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, all in southern South America. Conversely, it is lowest in Honduras and Guatemala, El Salvador\u2019s Central American neighbours. On a related topic, in Ecuador, Guatemala and Paraguay, outright majorities of respondents said they could support a military government. These three countries are also among the five where participants thought a coup was most likely to occur in the coming years, along with Venezuela, which is already under dictatorship, and Honduras.\nPerhaps the most worrisome finding in the poll is the age breakdown of views on democracy. Younger Latin Americans, with no memory of the region\u2019s murderous military dictatorships of the 1970s, are the least likely to agree that \u201cdemocracy is preferable to any other form of government\u201d, whereas support is firmest among the old. Even when comparing people of the same sex and education level in the same country, the share of respondents committed to democracy is around 16 percentage points lower for 20-year-olds than for 75-year-olds. Unless the young of today change their minds as they age, average support for democracy will continue to decline as older generations die off. If Latin America\u2019s remaining liberal leaders fail to improve their citizens\u2019 lives, democratic backsliding is likely to metastasise into a grim regional trend. \u25a0", "description": "A new poll suggests a worrying regional trend", "ogDescription": "A new poll suggests a worrying regional trend", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230722_AMP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-07-20T13:21:30Z", "dateModified": "2023-07-20T13:26:12Z", "dateCreated": "2023-07-19T18:11:18Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-07-22T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/ai3kjmroqmoagkhfc894httj93g17koa", "publication": [{"id": "/content/sl6sqo608pbsloq0752qjeepclu15bct", "context": {"position": 600.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/upiv8faakrffsi4ar9nhd2amtlrvges5", "context": {"position": 600.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/go51ge2gu5q77tuom4d28vgorm6hkus3", "context": {"position": 600.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0ucd5kje5o10oao57421nbnkrfuqegic", "context": {"position": 600.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ki5uam277luc46jm3vqb43dqn1kamsl6", "context": {"position": 600.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/7lunr64s64p7tu6shm1b8gsun8h2koph", "context": {"position": 600.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/vuh71rh0csb6tm4jmupadbpvo6b4j3qv", "context": {"position": 600.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/9v6i222upo5e7ejakdf1qhb08mb4fri5", "context": {"position": 600.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Nayib Bukele shows how to dismantle a democracy and stay popular", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/07/20/nayib-bukele-shows-how-to-dismantle-a-democracy-and-stay-popular", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4oescifldp7evo9cd2sqqo5uhain81c2", "publication": [{"id": "/content/sl6sqo608pbsloq0752qjeepclu15bct", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/upiv8faakrffsi4ar9nhd2amtlrvges5", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/go51ge2gu5q77tuom4d28vgorm6hkus3", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0ucd5kje5o10oao57421nbnkrfuqegic", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ki5uam277luc46jm3vqb43dqn1kamsl6", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/7lunr64s64p7tu6shm1b8gsun8h2koph", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/vuh71rh0csb6tm4jmupadbpvo6b4j3qv", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/9v6i222upo5e7ejakdf1qhb08mb4fri5", "context": {"position": 600.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Young Latin Americans are unusually open to autocrats", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/07/20/young-latin-americans-are-unusually-open-to-autocrats", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
