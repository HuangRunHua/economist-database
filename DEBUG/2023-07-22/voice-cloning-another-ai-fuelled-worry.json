But while she kept him on the phone, friends managed to reach her daughter, only to discover that she was, in fact, free and well on a skiing trip in Arizona. The voice used on the phone was a fake.\nMs DeStefano, still shaken, told this story to a US Senate subcommittee hearing on artificial intelligence in June. The dangers that voice-cloning technology pose are only now starting to be uttered aloud. In recent months, most of the attention paid to artificial intelligence (AI) has gone to so-called \u201clarge-language models\u201d like ChatGPT, which churn out text. But voice cloning\u2019s implications will also be profound. \nA brief sample of a voice can be used to train an AI model, which can then speak any given text sounding like that person. Apple is expected to include the feature for iPhones in its new operating system, iOS 17, due to be released in September. It is advertised as helping people who may be in danger of losing their voice, for example to a degenerative disease such as ALS.\nFor those eager to try voice cloning now, ElevenLabs, an AI startup, offers users the chance to create their own clones in minutes. The results are disturbingly accurate. When generating a playback, the system offers a slider that allows users to choose between variability and stability. Select more variability, and the audio will have a lifelike intonation, including pauses and stumbles like \u201cer\u2026\u201d Choose \u201cstability\u201d, and it will come across more like a calm and dispassionate newsreader.\nTaylor Jones, a linguist and consultant, took a careful look at the quality of ElevenLabs\u2019s clone of his voice in a YouTube video. Using statistical tests he showed that there were a few things off in \u201chis\u201d pronunciation of certain vowels. But a lower-tech test, a \u201cconversation\u201d with his own mother, fooled the woman who raised him. (\u201cDon\u2019t you ever do that again,\u201d she warned.) Johnson repeated the experiment with his own mother, who did not miss a beat in replying to clone-Johnson. \nFor several years, customers have been able to identify themselves over the phone to their bank and other companies using their voice. This was a security upgrade, not a danger. Not even a gifted mimic could fool the detection system. But the advent of cloning will force adaptation, for example by including voice as only one of several identification factors (and thus undercutting the convenience), in order to prevent fraud.\nCreative industries could face disruption too. Voice actors\u2019 skills, trained over a lifetime, can be ripped off in a matter of seconds. The Telegraph, a British broadsheet, recently reported on actors who had mistakenly signed away rights to their voices, making it possible to clone them for nothing. New contracts will be needed in future. But some actors may, in fact, find cloning congenial. Val Kilmer, who has lost much of his voice to throat cancer, was delighted to have his voice restored for \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d. Others may be spared heading to the studio for retakes. It is the middling professional, not the superstar, who is most threatened.\nAnother industry that will have to come to grips with the rise of clones is journalism. On-the-sly recordings\u2014such as Donald Trump\u2019s boast of grabbing women by a certain private body part\u2014have long been the stuff of blockbuster scoops. Now who will trust a story based on an audio clip?\nSlightly easier to manage might be the false positives: recordings purporting to be someone but which are fakes. Sophisticated forensic techniques could be of use here, proving a clip to be AI, say, in a courtroom. The opposite problem\u2014the false negatives\u2014will arise when public figures deny authentic recordings. Proving that a clip is genuine is hard, perhaps even impossible. Journalists will need to show how they obtained and stored audio files\u2014unless, as so often, they have promised a source anonymity.\nDuring his first presidential run, Mr Trump did more than anyone to popularise the term \u201cfake news\u201d\u2014and that was well before voice cloning, deepfake videos, artificially generated images and the like were widespread. Now, ever more people caught up in wrongdoing will be tempted by the defence, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Many people will have even more reason to believe them.\u25a0\nRead more from Johnson, our columnist on language:\nTalking about AI in human terms is natural\u2014but wrong (Jun 22nd)\nGestures are a subtle and vital form of communication (Jun 8th)\nAs it spreads across the world, who owns English?
