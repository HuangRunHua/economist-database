"https://www.economist.com/china/2023/07/20/germanys-new-strategy-for-dealings-with-china", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "Three years ago, Angela Merkel, then Germany\u2019s chancellor, said it was important to have a \u201crelationship of trust\u201d with China. On July 13th the government that succeeded her published a long-awaited paper laying out how it plans to handle those ties. It did not echo Mrs Merkel\u2019s belief. \u201cChina has changed,\u201d it said, adding: \u201cAs a result of this and China\u2019s political decisions, we need to change our approach to China.\u201d Governments across Europe have long been saying much the same. But for Germany to set out a detailed case for China-scepticism was striking. \nAfter Mrs Merkel handed over the chancellery to Olaf Scholz in December 2021, Germany\u2019s new ruling coalition promised a rethink of the country\u2019s China strategy. Drafting a document setting out the fresh approach\u2014the first paper of its kind produced by Germany\u2014was a tortuous effort. There were differences to reconcile between the views of Mr Scholz, whose instincts on China are redolent of Mrs Merkel\u2019s with their emphasis on business interests, and those of the foreign and economic ministries, which are led by more hawkish members of his three-party coalition. There were also the views of the European Union and America, among others, to take into account. \nDuring the drafting, many questions were raised about how much of a change was under way. Last October Mr Scholz pushed through the sale of a stake in one of Hamburg\u2019s port terminals to a Chinese state-owned firm: a smaller share than had been proposed, and with no voting rights for the Chinese side, but still controversial among the hawks. When Mr Scholz paid a visit to Beijing in November, the first by a Western leader since the start of the covid-19 pandemic, he took a big delegation of businesspeople, including 12 CEOs of German blue-chip firms. In June he rolled out the red carpet for Li Qiang, China\u2019s new prime minister, acquiescing to Chinese demands that there be no questions at a joint press conference. \nBut the strategy paper confirmed a shift. It did not talk of hope of \u201cWandel durch Handel\u201c (change through trade), once a motto of the Merkel era. \u201cDe-risking is urgently needed,\u201d the document said, using the now standard language of EU and American officials when referring to the dangers of over-reliance on economic ties with China. It echoed the EU\u2019s labelling of China as a \u201csystemic rival\u201d and said China\u2019s friendly relations with Russia had \u201cdirect security implications for Germany\u201d. It warned that military escalation by China in the Taiwan Strait would \u201caffect German and European interests\u201d. The paper promised that Germany would co-ordinate \u201cmore closely\u201d with its partners in the EU on China matters. It did mention a relationship of trust: with America. Andrew Small of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research centre, calls the language \u201cmarkedly different from where we were with Merkel and the way she was willing to frame things\u201d. \nBusiness decisions\nMr Small says that, though large German firms have expressed support for the strategy, \u201cthey haven\u2019t jumped in to embrace it\u201d. They have much at stake. According to the Rhodium Group, a research firm, Germany\u2019s three big carmakers\u2014BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen\u2014plus BASF, a chemicals giant, accounted for more than one-third of all European direct investment in China between 2018 and 2021. But the paper is softer than a version that was leaked in November: no more talk of \u201cstress tests\u201d of German companies that are heavily involved in China, or making them \u201cspecify and summarise relevant China-related developments\u201d. De-risking, it appears, will be up to businesses themselves. Some of them may not share the government\u2019s sense of urgency. \u25a0\nSubscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what
