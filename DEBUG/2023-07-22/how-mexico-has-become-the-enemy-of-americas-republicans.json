being talked out of the idea. Mark Esper, the then defence secretary, recounted the incident in his memoirs published last year, astonished that bombing a neighbour could be seriously thought of. \nNow the extraordinary is becoming more commonplace as Republicans argue that greater use of military force, or the threat of it, can help control America\u2019s southern border and curb the smuggling of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is produced illegally in Mexico. \nOne congressman, Michael McCaul of Texas, has introduced a bill to classify fentanyl as a \u201cchemical weapon\u201d. Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina, is pushing one to designate Mexican cartels as \u201cforeign terrorist organisations\u201d. Dan Crenshaw and Mike Waltz, congressmen from Texas and Florida respectively, have proposed another that would authorise \u201call necessary and appropriate force\u201d against foreign states, organisations or people linked to trafficking fentanyl.\nRepublican presidential candidates, too, are talking tough. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has suggested a naval blockade of Mexico-bound shipping to halt the import of fentanyl precursor chemicals from China. Nikki Haley, a former ambassador to the UN, has proposed sending in special forces with a warning to Mexico: \u201cEither you do it or we do it.\u201d Tim Scott, the other senator from South Carolina, declared in May, \u201cI will allow the world\u2019s greatest military to fight these terrorists.\u201d\nTucker Carlson, a former Fox News host beloved by America\u2019s hard right, goes further, regarding Mexico as an outright foe. On July 14th, while interrogating Republican presidential hopefuls (minus Mr Trump) at the Family Leadership Summit, a gathering of religious conservatives in Iowa, he grilled Mr Scott about his support for Ukraine: \u201cNo Americans killed by Russia. Hundreds of thousands killed by Mexico. But Mexico is our ally and Russia is our enemy\u2014how does that work?\u201d Mr Scott did not demur from the idea that Mexico was an enemy, but said America could deal with Russia and Mexico simultaneously.\nMany Mexicans feel they are again the pi\u00f1ata of America\u2019s election season, freely beaten by any politician. Earlier this year Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a left-wing populist who got on with Mr Trump, took issue with the militarist talk, saying: \u201cIn addition to being irresponsible, it is an offence to the people of Mexico, a lack of respect for our sovereignty.\u201d He warned that he might urge Mexican and Hispanic voters not to cast their ballots for Republicans. \n\nThe anti-Mexican mood on America\u2019s right is hardening, moving beyond Mr Trump\u2019s cheap shots against migrants in 2015, when he said \u201cthey are bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists.\u201d According to tracking polls by YouGov, Republican voters are fast turning against Mexico. Roughly as many think Mexico is now an \u201cenemy\u201d as consider it an \u201cally\u201d, with about 45% supporting each proposition (see chart). Democrats are largely unchanged, with about 70% regarding their southern neighbour as an ally. The Republican disenchantment has grown in the past year. \nAt least three factors may be at play. The first is frustration over fentanyl-related deaths, which rose sharply in 2020 and 2021. The drug has become the biggest killer of Americans aged 18-45, responsible for most of the 70,000 deaths from overdoses of synthetic opioids in 2021. Second, suggests Mark Jones of Rice University, the defeat of Mr Trump \u201cunshackled\u201d Republicans, freeing them to denounce President Joe Biden for his handling of the border. \u201cThere is no better issue for Republicans,\u201d he says. \u201cIt mobilises their base. And it splits Democrats: whatever Joe Biden does will seem too fascist by the left and too permissive by centrists.\u201d\nA third factor, adds David Frum, a writer and former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, is the war in Ukraine. Given the MAGA movement\u2019s hostility to Ukraine and sympathy for Russia\u2014a position that runs against many voters\u2019 views\u2014denouncing Mexico allows them to cast themselves as \u201cguardians of the country\u201d.\nSuch policies are gaining an intellectual underpinning through a network of Trump-leaning think-tanks preparing for a future administration. A paper by the Centre for Renewing America, entitled \u201cIt\u2019s time to wage war on transnational drug cartels\u201d, is reported to have caught the attention of Mr Trump, among others. Its author, Ken Cuccinelli, argues that America should be free to take military action in Mexico given that its government does not fully control its territory. Never mind that it would stir deep anti-Americanism, or that treating Mexico like a failed state might turn it into one. \u201cMexico is not a friend. It is complicit in the drug cartels,\u201d says Mr Cuccinelli. \u201cIt\u2019s time to acknowledge that the relationship has changed.\u201d \u25a0\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.
