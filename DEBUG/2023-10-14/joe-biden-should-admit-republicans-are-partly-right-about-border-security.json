ever a good case for a centrist third party in American presidential elections\u2014and right now there is not\u2014the strongest reason would be the mass migration under way in the western hemisphere, which is prompting both major parties to take foolish and even inhumane positions. The surge in illegal crossings of the southern border is a complex problem. But having fed it through the polarisation machine, Democrats and Republicans have come up with simple, reciprocally stymying answers that defy not only compromise but common sense, too. \nThe latest demonstration came in early October, when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published plans to install 20 new miles of barriers along the Rio Grande in south-eastern Texas. As a candidate Joe Biden promised to build \u201cnot another foot\u201d of wall, so reporters sensed the dangling shape of a favourite pi\u00f1ata, hypocrisy, and prepared to swing away. \nBut when they bearded the president in the Oval Office, he had an explanation: Congress made him do it. True enough. In 2019 Congress appropriated $1.375bn for a \u201cbarrier system along the south-west border\u201d. Having tried to persuade Congress to redirect what remains of that money, the Biden administration was at risk of breaking the law if it did not act. Asked if he believed a border wall \u201cworks\u201d, Mr Biden replied, flatly, \u201cNo\u201d. The problem turned out, in other words, to be worse than hypocrisy. It was inanity. Mr Biden could not give an answer that would strike any child as obviously true: walls do work, but only sometimes. \nMr Biden could have pointed to the case study surrounding him, in the form of the fence around the White House. Such efficacy in impeding ingress, he might have said, explained why as a senator he voted to build border barriers under a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and a Republican one, George W. Bush. He might have added that it also explained why, when he was Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president, that administration added more new miles of barrier than Donald Trump. (Although Mr Trump built 458 miles of wall, all but 87 replaced existing barriers; Mr Obama built 130 incremental miles.) Mr Biden might even have pointed out that the DHS\u2019s 2023 budget states that barriers can work: \u201cThe border wall system impedes and denies illicit cross-border activity by allowing law enforcement an increased response time.\u201d\nBut Mr Biden could permit himself no such nuance. Mr Trump has vowed to build a giant wall along the entire border, which stretches nearly 2,000 miles. This would be a boondoggle. A wall is unnecessary where natural barriers exist, and easily defeated in remote areas where patrols will not spot smugglers as they cut through, as they have done thousands of times. But despite Mr Biden\u2019s past positions, to acknowledge now that barriers can play a part in securing the border would be to say Mr Trump is not entirely wrong. And that, Mr Biden\u2019s advisers know, is anathema to the Democrats\u2019 progressive base. \nThe new bits of wall are to run through Starr County, Texas, in the district of Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat. Mr Cuellar thinks the barriers will be ineffective there; he favours more border agents and surveillance equipment instead. He is frustrated by Democrats\u2019 reluctance to secure the border. In early October he  was carjacked at gunpoint in Washington. Unharmed and admirably unruffled\u2014though annoyed to have his sushi stolen with his car\u2014he seized the opportunity when Mr Biden called to express concern. \u201cI said, \u2018Mr President, we as Democrats can be strong on border security and still be respectful of immigrants\u2019 rights\u2019,\u201d he recalls, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a balance.\u201d He says Mr Biden understood and asked to follow up. \nIn fact, writes Franklin Foer in \u201cThe Last Politician\u201d, a new book about Mr Biden, immigration was \u201cwhere he was most out of step with his evolving party\u2019s leftward trajectory\u201d. As a candidate, Mr Biden worried that progressive politics \u201cmight cost Democrats the rustbelt\u201d, but to win nomination he felt he had \u201cto commit himself to a wholesale reversal of Trump immigration policy\u201d.\nUntil recently, Mr Biden seemed content with that calculation, looking away as the border grew more chaotic. Mr Trump remained so noxious that suburban voters were unlikely to defect to him. Indeed, as though to remind them why they turned to Mr Biden in 2020\u2014and why a centrist third-party is a terrible idea now, when it might elect Mr Trump\u2014the former president recently said migrants were \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d. \nBlue state blues\nBut migrants by the tens of thousands are arriving in cities and states represented by Democrats. America\u2019s immigration system was built to manage single men from Mexico looking for work, not families travelling from Venezuela or farther afield. Unlike past migrants, the newcomers tend not to have contacts in America; rather than melt into the country they remain in shelters, weighing on public budgets. America needs more agents, asylum officials and beds at the border, more flexibility to send migrants to other safe countries, and harsher consequences for those crossing illegally without legitimate claims. Mr Biden could do some of this on his own, but much of it requires Congress to act. \nAndrew Selee of the Migration Policy Institute, a think-tank in Washington, says the approaching budget negotiations might lead to a compromise. A deal is not probable, he says, but \u201cthere is definitely more of a pathway forward now than there was a month ago\u201d. He cites more \u201cwillingness from the administration to explore some tougher options\u201d and more concern from Republicans about unfilled jobs. Enhanced border security might also prove to be the price of the Ukraine funding Mr Biden wants.\nThe president should see this as an opportunity. Illegal immigration is eroding support for legal immigration. And most Americans would respect a politician big enough to acknowledge when the other guy has a point, even if his name is Trump. \u25a0\nRead more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics:\nWhat America should really learn from Dianne Feinstein (Oct 5th)\nA Trump Party in the Reagan Library (Sep 28th)\nAmerica\u2019s dumbest, wildest budget fight yet (Sep 21st)\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.
