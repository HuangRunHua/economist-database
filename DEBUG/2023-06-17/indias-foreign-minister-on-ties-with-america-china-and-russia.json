And obviously try to make the best of it,\u201d says Mr Jaishankar, a dapper 68-year-old. \u201cEvery country would like to do that. Some may be constrained by other obligations, some may not.\u201d\nAs the world churns\nThat transactional view (in a recent book, Mr Jaishankar describes a \u201cmultipolar world with frenemies\u201d) does not preclude long-term partnerships. On the contrary, the \u201ctransformation of the India-US relationship\u201d, he says, is \u201cthe big change in my professional life\u201d. He attributes much of this to Mr Modi, crediting the prime minister with having jettisoned the \u201cideological hesitations\u201d\u2014by which he means anti-Americanism\u2014of India\u2019s former left-leaning elite. Now, he says, the relationship is \u201cgetting more consequential by the day\u2026 moving forward very, very rapidly\u201d. He believes it will be further boosted by two big economic changes: diversification of supply chains away from China and increased digitisation. Both processes, which he describes as a \u201cnew globalisation\u201d, in theory depend on the sort of mutual trust India and America are building.\nIf America wants proof of India\u2019s reliability, he implies, it should not look to it to unwind its ties with Russia, but, counter-intuitively, the opposite. India\u2019s relationship with Russia, which he terms \u201ca cardinal principle of our foreign policy\u201d, has been an enduring feature of it for \u201c60 years of history\u201d\u2014including, he notes pointedly, an American arms embargo on India in 1965 that pushed it to the Soviets. This is clearly self-serving, but so is India\u2019s foreign policy. That is rather the point. Mr Jaishankar, far from apologising for India\u2019s eagerness to get economic advantage from Vladimir Putin\u2019s illegal war, openly relishes the prospect of getting more. He believes Russia is being economically reoriented towards Asia. \u201cWhat I suspect this whole Ukraine issue is going to mean is that Russia, a country which was actually truly Eurasian, is probably today discovering or is anticipating that a large part of its relationship with the West will no longer work.\u201d Meanwhile, India\u2019s growth is fuelling its hunger for Russian resources. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense that the two trends intersect.\u201d\nUnder its urbane first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, India was known for demanding a more moral world order. It can now sound like the world\u2019s most untrammelled realist. In truth, the change is not that marked. India was not so much virtuously \u201cnon-aligned\u201d as simply marginal to world affairs, because it was weak and introspective. Despite its tendency to grandstand against the West, it was still willing to align itself with America when threatened, as when it accepted its military aid during a war with China in 1962. In recent years, no doubt, it has engaged with America more openly and decisively. Yet the transformative change in India\u2019s global position has to do with its fortunes.\nIts economic rise has brought it to the centre of global affairs\u2014and Mr Jaishankar predicts demography alone will ensure that growth continues: India \u201cchurns out\u201d trained people on a scale no other democratic society can. India\u2019s new importance, in turn, is giving it many more opportunities to pursue the same preoccupations\u2014including its economy and territorial integrity\u2014it has always prioritised. And if it seems unusually upfront or unapologetic about those goals, that points to an even more momentous geopolitical change.\nThe emergence of new great powers\u2014for now China and arguably India; in future perhaps Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria\u2014is making geopolitics more complicated and prone to the sorts of contradictions and trade-offs that Indian foreign policy embraces. India is not only maintaining its lucrative relationship with Russia as a hedge against the West. It also considers its partnership with Russia a means to limit Russian support for its two major adversaries, Pakistan and China.\n Igniting Indo-American co-operation\n\nMr Jaishankar insists that those around Joe Biden, America\u2019s president, well understand the looser, more uncertain and sometimes contradictory international relations that a multipolar world will foster. \u201cI think they\u2019re acutely conscious that the post-1945 order has been severely challenged and that they need a new template, new partners, that they need to look beyond alliance constructs.\u201d There is evidence for this, despite Mr Biden\u2019s talk of a new \u201calliance of democracies\u201d. In a recent speech, Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser, envisaged a world in which America will pursue its economic self-interest more overtly than it has in recent years, while working with a cast of friends and allies who will do likewise. In describing this apparently more-contingent American-led order, Mr Sullivan used the word \u201cpartners\u201d 24 times but \u201callies\u201d only twice.\nPerhaps that is the best the West can hope for. Emerging powers such as India, with huge economic needs and complicated domestic politics, will not line up behind America, or for that matter China, in the old cold-war fashion. Whether the new geopolitical reality they represent will be stable is another question. India\u2019s relationship with China may be an early test. Always fraught, it is the pole around which revolve America\u2019s approach to India, India\u2019s receptiveness to America, and ultimately, it might be argued, Asian security.\nHome and affray\nMr Jaishankar denies that India\u2019s military embrace of America\u2014with whom the Indian armed forces now conduct more exercises than with any other power\u2014has tightened in response to the border clashes of 2020. Yet the Asian powers\u2019 territorial dispute is clearly a big factor in their rivalry and, it follows, a spur to defence co-operation between America and India. It is therefore worth pondering the implications for India\u2019s ties with America if India and China were to succeed in their current effort to resolve the dispute, at least for now, by negotiating a demilitarised \u201cbuffer zone\u201d along their frontier.\nSome American strategists are already questioning India\u2019s utility on security. As the chief proponent of the civil-nuclear co-operation deal that America negotiated with India in 2005, Ashley Tellis, now of the Carnegie Endowment, a think-tank in Washington, was instrumental in the bilateral rapprochement. Yet, in a recent essay in Foreign Affairs entitled \u201cAmerica\u2019s bad bet on India\u201d, he sought to temper American hopes that India will be a pivotal security partner. India wants American help only to defend itself against possible Chinese aggression, he argued; it cannot be counted on to help America fight China.\nMr Jaishankar will not be drawn on the buffer-zone talks, or, hypothetically, on how a deal might affect Indian relations with China or America. \u201cWe know that solving the boundary question will take time,\u201d he says, adding that ensuring \u201cpeace and tranquillity\u201d and \u201cno acts of violence\u201d should be the minimum condition for \u201cmoving the relationship forward\u201d. \u201cUnless we find a resolution to that, no government can, at least in my opinion, pretend that everything is OK, and let\u2019s do business in every other part of our relationship.\u201d\nIt may be that Mr Tellis and others are worrying too much about India\u2019s commitment to America. Over the past two decades, the relationship has developed significant ballast and momentum, based on shared interests, a vigorous Indian-American diaspora and enthusiastic cross-party support in both countries. Most of that will endure. Comparing India with its dysfunctional neighbour, Stephen Cohen, a late scholar of South Asia, used to say that Pakistan was an American ally but never a friend, and India the opposite. That is truer now than ever. \nEven so, the doubt about what sort of partnership America and its allies should expect of India, a rising power that rejects alliances and juggles competing priorities, is a significant one. \u201cYou have an India which is looking at multiple opportunities across multiple geographies, often polities which have contradictory interests. And it is trying to advance on all fronts,\u201d says Mr Jaishankar. It is a good appraisal of India\u2019s challenging new role in the world. It also underlines the uncertainties, and threat to stability, that Mr Kissinger warned of in an increasingly multipolar world. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print":

Kissinger, a former American secretary of state, gave a troubling assessment of a world in which old powers are fading, new ones are rising and superpower conflict threatens. Yet he offered, alongside few other hopeful notes, this accolade: \u201cI have very high regard for the way the Indians conduct their foreign policy now, because it shows balance.\u201d\nAmong the ways this was striking was the fact that Mr Kissinger is known in India as the former enabler of a viscerally anti-Indian president. \u201cThe Indians are bastards,\u201d he told Richard Nixon, after the president had hosted India\u2019s prime minister at the time, Indira Gandhi, at the White House in 1971. \u201cThey are the most aggressive goddamn people around.\u201d\nWhat has changed in Indian diplomacy in the intervening decades? In some ways, everything. Over the past quarter of a century, as India has added economic heft to its vast populace, America and its allies have come to see it as an indispensable counterweight to an assertive China. And India, which under Mrs Gandhi was closer to the Soviet Union than America, has seized with growing enthusiasm the opportunities for closer ties that the West has offered. Narendra Modi, in Washington next week to accept praise and goodies\u2014including the possible offer of a step-up in co-operation on high-tech weapons\u2014has gone so far as to describe India and America as \u201cnatural allies\u201d. \nIn other ways, however, Indian foreign policy remains distinctly challenging to America. India does not really believe in alliances. An immutable feature of its foreign policy, from Nehruvian non-alignment to today, is a deep, post-colonial fear of being beholden to a richer power. That in itself might raise doubts about the extent of its pro-Western tilt. And indeed, it has embraced America\u2019s outreach mainly as an economic opportunity, less fulsomely as a strategic one\u2014albeit that its desire for defence and security ties is growing, especially following border clashes with China in 2020. India has also retained its close ties to Russia, whose invasion of Ukraine it refuses to condemn. Russia supplies most of its arms and, thanks to a generous wartime discount, nearly half of its oil. \nRead more of our package on India:\nJoe Biden and Narendra Modi are drawing their countries closer\nAmerica is courting India in part for its growing economic clout\nOn defence, America and India edge closer together\nBanyan: Narendra Modi is the world\u2019s most popular leader\nIndia\u2019s diaspora is bigger and more influential than any in history\n\n\nMr Kissinger reserved particular praise for India\u2019s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar\u2014calling him \u201cthe practising political leader that is quite close to my views\u201d. To discuss the geopolitical oddity that India\u2019s rising power represents, Mr Jaishankar sat down with The Economist for a rare, hour-long interview in his airy, sandstone office in Delhi.\nFormerly India\u2019s top diplomat (and ambassador to both Washington and Beijing), Mr Jaishankar is one of the brains behind India\u2019s balancing act. Besides the familiar diffidence about alliances, he espouses above all a commitment to multipolarity. Unlike many in Washington, India does not see the world in terms of a cold-war-style duality, pitting American-led countries against those hewing to China. It sees an emerging dance of big powers\u2014chiefly America, China, Russia and itself\u2014in which it will engage multiple partners, albeit to different degrees. \u201cWe would like to have multiple choices. And obviously try to make the best of it,\u201d says Mr Jaishankar, a dapper 68-year-old. \u201cEvery country would like to do that. Some may be constrained by other obligations, some may not.\u201d\nAs the world churns\nThat transactional view (in a recent book, Mr Jaishankar describes a \u201cmultipolar world with frenemies\u201d) does not preclude long-term partnerships. On the contrary, the \u201ctransformation of the India-US relationship\u201d, he says, is \u201cthe big change in my professional life\u201d. He attributes much of this to Mr Modi, crediting the prime minister with having jettisoned the \u201cideological hesitations\u201d\u2014by which he means anti-Americanism\u2014of India\u2019s former left-leaning elite. Now, he says, the relationship is \u201cgetting more consequential by the day\u2026 moving forward very, very rapidly\u201d. He believes it will be further boosted by two big economic changes: diversification of supply chains away from China and increased digitisation. Both processes, which he describes as a \u201cnew globalisation\u201d, in theory depend on the sort of mutual trust India and America are building.\nIf America wants proof of India\u2019s reliability, he implies, it should not look to it to unwind its ties with Russia, but, counter-intuitively, the opposite. India\u2019s relationship with Russia, which he terms \u201ca cardinal principle of our foreign policy\u201d, has been an enduring feature of it for \u201c60 years of history\u201d\u2014including, he notes pointedly, an American arms embargo on India in 1965 that pushed it to the Soviets. This is clearly self-serving, but so is India\u2019s foreign policy. That is rather the point. Mr Jaishankar, far from apologising for India\u2019s eagerness to get economic advantage from Vladimir Putin\u2019s illegal war, openly relishes the prospect of getting more. He believes Russia is being economically reoriented towards Asia. \u201cWhat I suspect this whole Ukraine issue is going to mean is that Russia, a country which was actually truly Eurasian, is probably today discovering or is anticipating that a large part of its relationship with the West will no longer work.\u201d Meanwhile, India\u2019s growth is fuelling its hunger for Russian resources. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense that the two trends intersect.\u201d\nUnder its urbane first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, India was known for demanding a more moral world order. It can now sound like the world\u2019s most untrammelled realist. In truth, the change is not that marked. India was not so much virtuously \u201cnon-aligned\u201d as simply marginal to world affairs, because it was weak and introspective. Despite its tendency to grandstand against the West, it was still willing to align itself with America when threatened, as when it accepted its military aid during a war with China in 1962. In recent years, no doubt, it has engaged with America more openly and decisively. Yet the transformative change in India\u2019s global position has to do with its fortunes.\nIts economic rise has brought it to the centre of global affairs\u2014and Mr Jaishankar predicts demography alone will ensure that growth continues: India \u201cchurns out\u201d trained people on a scale no other democratic society can. India\u2019s new importance, in turn, is giving it many more opportunities to pursue the same preoccupations\u2014including its economy and territorial integrity\u2014it has always prioritised. And if it seems unusually upfront or unapologetic about those goals, that points to an even more momentous geopolitical change.\nThe emergence of new great powers\u2014for now China and arguably India; in future perhaps Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria\u2014is making geopolitics more complicated and prone to the sorts of contradictions and trade-offs that Indian foreign policy embraces. India is not only maintaining its lucrative relationship with Russia as a hedge against the West. It also considers its partnership with Russia a means to limit Russian support for its two major adversaries, Pakistan and China.\n Igniting Indo-American co-operation\n\nMr Jaishankar insists that those around Joe Biden, America\u2019s president, well understand the looser, more uncertain and sometimes contradictory international relations that a multipolar world will foster. \u201cI think they\u2019re acutely conscious that the post-1945 order has been severely challenged and that they need a new template, new partners, that they need to look beyond alliance constructs.\u201d There is evidence for this, despite Mr Biden\u2019s talk of a new \u201calliance of democracies\u201d. In a recent speech, Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser, envisaged a world in which America will pursue its economic self-interest more overtly than it has in recent years, while working with a cast of friends and allies who will do likewise. In describing this apparently more-contingent American-led order, Mr Sullivan used the word \u201cpartners\u201d 24 times but \u201callies\u201d only twice.\nPerhaps that is the best the West can hope for. Emerging powers such as India, with huge economic needs and complicated domestic politics, will not line up behind America, or for that matter China, in the old cold-war fashion. Whether the new geopolitical reality they represent will be stable is another question. India\u2019s relationship with China may be an early test. Always fraught, it is the pole around which revolve America\u2019s approach to India, India\u2019s receptiveness to America, and ultimately, it might be argued, Asian security.\nHome and affray\nMr Jaishankar denies that India\u2019s military embrace of America\u2014with whom the Indian armed forces now conduct more exercises than with any other power\u2014has tightened in response to the border clashes of 2020. Yet the Asian powers\u2019 territorial dispute is clearly a big factor in their rivalry and, it follows, a spur to defence co-operation between America and India. It is therefore worth pondering the implications for India\u2019s ties with America if India and China were to succeed in their current effort to resolve the dispute, at least for now, by negotiating a demilitarised \u201cbuffer zone\u201d along their frontier.\nSome American strategists are already questioning India\u2019s utility on security. As the chief proponent of the civil-nuclear co-operation deal that America negotiated with India in 2005, Ashley Tellis, now of the Carnegie Endowment, a think-tank in Washington, was instrumental in the bilateral rapprochement. Yet, in a recent essay in Foreign Affairs entitled \u201cAmerica\u2019s bad bet on India\u201d, he sought to temper American hopes that India will be a pivotal security partner. India wants American help only to defend itself against possible Chinese aggression, he argued; it cannot be counted on to help America fight China.\nMr Jaishankar will not be drawn on the buffer-zone talks, or, hypothetically, on how a deal might affect Indian relations with China or America. \u201cWe know that solving the boundary question will take time,\u201d he says, adding that ensuring \u201cpeace and tranquillity\u201d and \u201cno acts of violence\u201d should be the minimum condition for \u201cmoving the relationship forward\u201d. \u201cUnless we find a resolution to that, no government can, at least in my opinion, pretend that everything is OK, and let\u2019s do business in every other part of our relationship.\u201d\nIt may be that Mr Tellis and others are worrying too much about India\u2019s commitment to America. Over the past two decades, the relationship has developed significant ballast and momentum, based on shared interests, a vigorous Indian-American diaspora and enthusiastic cross-party support in both countries. Most of that will endure. Comparing India with its dysfunctional neighbour, Stephen Cohen, a late scholar of South Asia, used to say that Pakistan was an American ally but never a friend, and India the opposite. That is truer now than ever. \nEven so, the doubt about what sort of partnership America and its allies should expect of India, a rising power that rejects alliances and juggles competing priorities, is a significant one. \u201cYou have an India which is looking at multiple opportunities across multiple geographies, often polities which have contradictory interests. And it is trying to advance on all fronts,\u201d says Mr Jaishankar. It is a good appraisal of India\u2019s challenging new role in the world. It also underlines the uncertainties, and threat to stability, that Mr Kissinger warned of in an increasingly multipolar world. \u25a0", "description": "In a rare interview Subrahmanyam Jaishankar
