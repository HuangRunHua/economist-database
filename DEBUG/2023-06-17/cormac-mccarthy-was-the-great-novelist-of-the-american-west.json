Saul Bellow is the supreme chronicler of Chicago. New York is contested territory. For a long time, Wallace Stegner could have laid claim to the West. But that was before Cormac McCarthy hit his stride.\nTo understand the American West, you need to know the land and its beautiful, terrifying expanse, as Stegner did. But in his fiction Mr McCarthy, who died on June 13th at the age of 89, grasped and dramatised another essential truth: that the West was won with violence. The saga of the region\u2019s piecemeal incorporation into America involved bravery, gumption and careful planning\u2014but also decades of brutal, intimate bloodshed. It haunts every strip mall and stylish restaurant and housing development from Kansas City to Los Angeles and beyond. This was Mr McCarthy\u2019s subject: the reality and implacability of cruelty and conflict.\nThe great theme of his career is all the more striking because this was not his native territory. He was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1933 with the first name Charles. At some point he changed it to Cormac, supposedly in honour of an Irish ruler, and he grew up mostly in Knoxville, Tennessee. His early novels\u2014\u201cThe Orchard Keeper\u201d (published in 1965), \u201cChild of God\u201d and \u201cSuttree\u201d\u2014were deeply Faulknerian: arch, self-referential and largely plotless.\nHe gained fame with his \u201cBorder trilogy\u201d: \u201cAll the Pretty Horses\u201d (1992), \u201cThe Crossing\u201d and \u201cCities of the Plain\u201d. Like all his fiction these were demanding stories, but they won him a wider readership, especially \u201cAll the Pretty Horses\u201d. Elegant and well plotted, it was made into a film starring Matt Damon and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz at the start of their careers. The best book in the trilogy was the last. It was austere, bloody and hopeless, as the West had been for those on the losing end of its conquest.\nThe best film adaptation of Mr McCarthy\u2019s work was the Coen brothers\u2019 version of \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d, a slim, propulsive, noirish novel published in 2005. A wonderful film that was true to the author\u2019s vision, it featured commanding performances from Josh Brolin as the foolish hero; Javier Bardem as his psychopathic nemesis; and Tommy Lee Jones, who imbues the sheriff of the story with a world-redeeming, plain-spoken goodness. Published in 2006, and recounting the plight of a father and son in a post-apocalyptic world, \u201cThe Road\u201d won a Pulitzer prize and also became a film.\nBut Mr McCarthy\u2019s best novel\u2014and arguably the best work of fiction written in English in the past 50 years\u2014was \u201cBlood Meridian\u201d. Its narrator, \u201cthe kid\u201d, joins a gang of Apache hunters who are hired to collect scalps at $100 apiece. Despite his deeds the kid, like Mr Jones\u2019s sheriff, has a stubborn decency, though it proves no match for his milieu.\nMr McCarthy based the book in part on the real-life Glanton Gang, scalp-hunters who haunted what is now Sonora, New Mexico, and bits of Arizona. It features one of literature\u2019s most pitiless and vibrant depictions of vice, in the form of a quasi-mythical character, fat and hairless, who becomes the novel\u2019s amoral centre. Its plot is relentlessly violent, the language almost biblical. Finishing it takes determination; at times it seems perversely intent on persuading readers to give up. The baroque descriptions of gore include a tree with dead babies hanging from the branches and a head split open \u201cto the thrapple\u201d. \nPersist: \u201cBlood Meridian\u201d makes art out of man\u2019s inhumanity to man. To read it is to know what not to do and how not to live, but also to confront an aspect of the past that all Americans inherit. It is not exactly redemptive; rather it bears witness. Mr McCarthy does not look away. He never did.\nHe lived a deeply unliterary life in the south-west, preferring the company of scientists to authors.
