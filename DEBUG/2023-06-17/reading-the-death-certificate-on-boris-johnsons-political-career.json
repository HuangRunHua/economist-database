career in politics read June 12th. A government statement appeared that evening appointing Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson as \u201cSteward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern\u201d, the title mps accept, according to Britain\u2019s absurd constitution, in order to resign. He went because an inquiry into whether Mr Johnson deliberately misled Parliament found that he had. Not only that, he\u2019d also impugned the investigating committee and joined a campaign of abuse and intimidation against it. Mr Johnson faced suspension as an MP for a remarkable 90 days. Given forewarning of the report, the former prime minister quit. \nA funeral for Mr Johnson\u2019s career had taken place some days before in a stuffy conference centre in Doncaster. The annual meeting of the Northern Research Group (nrg), a cartel of northern Conservative mps who owe their careers to Mr Johnson, was supposed to be a celebration. Instead it was a premature wake.\nThe miserable gathering was the best place to survey his political legacy. The nrg, rather than Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, represented the apogee of Mr Johnson\u2019s political career. It emerged after the 2019 general election, when the party won an 87-seat majority under Mr Johnson as voters across northern England backed the Conservatives for the first time in living memory. In 2005, the Conservatives had 19 northern mps. Then in 2019, they managed 68, with voters enticed by Mr Johnson\u2019s promise of nothing less than a realignment of British politics. \nNow, however, the realignment has reversed. Conservatives are losing everywhere. But support is falling fastest in the northern constituencies the party was so proud of winning. Across the country Labour enjoys a 14-point poll lead. In \u201cRed Wall\u201d constituencies, this rises to 23 points, according to one pollster. In Doncaster, people knew it. When Bagehot made politely optimistic noises about the Conservatives\u2019 chances of recovery, a Tory mp looked at him as if he was insane. \nFour years on, northern voters who backed the Tories have little to show for it. Conservative mps were happy to give excuses. Sir Jake Berry, an acolyte of Mr Johnson (with the knighthood to show for it), took aim at the \u201cblob\u201d\u2014the nickname for Whitehall civil servants. Sir Jake despaired that government spent more digging a single tunnel for hs2, a railway line from London to Birmingham, than it was prepared to spend on public transport to Bradford, England\u2019s tenth-biggest city. Curiously, the fact that it was his own party\u2019s doing went unmentioned. \nProblems were more fundamental than mere faulty execution. Not for the first time in his life, Mr Johnson had made impossible promises. Voters in northern seats were offered four big pledges: higher spending, lower immigration, no new taxes and Brexit. They received one: Brexit. And by delivering it, the other three became much harder to achieve. Brexit has weighed on growth. This meant a government committed to cutting immigration instead had to boost it, to give the economy a hand. Meanwhile the grand schemes that Mr Johnson had promised, such as a new rail line between the north\u2019s main cities, were scrapped because of fiscal pressures worsened by Brexit. Taxes have crept up anyway. \nInstead, mps offered bromides that would be best left in an airport self-help book. \u201cIt\u2019s about being a victor, not a victim,\u201d said Nick Fletcher, the mp for Don Valley, a post-industrial constituency on the outskirts of Doncaster. It is an admirable sentiment, albeit one he will struggle to live by. According to polls, Labour has a 90% chance of retaking the seat. When in doubt, people fall back on the vague boosterism beloved of Mr Johnson. \u201cHands in the air if you think the north is awesome,\u201d pleaded one chairwoman at a fringe event, channelling a children\u2019s television presenter. \nAny cause for optimism came, in the self-help vernacular, from a negative place. Voting Conservative for the first time was a big deal. \u201cThey want to be proven right,\u201d said Ben Houchen, the mayor for Tees Valley, a Johnson ally freshly ennobled in Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list. Shy Tories have won elections for the Conservatives before. Now the party is banking on obstinate ones. Mostly, however, Conservatives are hoping that Labour screws up. \u201cI guarantee Labour is going to shoot themselves in the foot,\u201d says the soon-to-be Lord Houchen. \nLabour will have to lose because the Conservatives are not trying to win. The party is on defensive manoeuvres. That means placating voters in the south-east. In the latest budget, the government promised more money for child care, which is most unaffordable in the south-east. Likewise, pension reforms that let people snuffle away \u00a360,000 per year tax-free were sold as a boost for surgeons, but will mainly go to bankers in Surrey. The Conservatives need to win voters in the north of England to hold power. The party needs to maintain voters in the south to exist. \nI know it\u2019s over and it never really began\nRishi Sunak, Mr Johnson\u2019s successor, talks a good game when it comes to the north. He wears the fact he represents a northern seat rather heavily, labelling himself a \u201cprime minister for the north\u201d. The seat is less Red Wall than dry-stone wall: his patch largely consists of two national parks. But the sweeping promises of Mr Johnson\u2019s era are gone. Prosaic achievements are heralded. There will be no new railway between the north\u2019s badly connected cities, but the Treasury has opened an office in Darlington, a town near Mr Sunak\u2019s constituency. \nInstead, Mr Sunak\u2019s speech to the delegates in Doncaster became an accidental eulogy for the form of Conservativism that Mr Johnson personified in 2019 but which is dead today. \u201cThere is no route to electoral success without you,\u201d said Mr Sunak. He is right. It was meant to be a call to arms, but came across as an admission of defeat. Mr Johnson is gone. His main political achievement will not live on. \u25a0\nWe\u2019re hiring (June 12th 2023). The Economist is looking for a Britain economics writer, based in London.
