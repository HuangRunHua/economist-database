The empirical evidence does not support this claim. Most speakers of English as a second language have an elementary or intermediate knowledge of it that is by no means comparable with that of native speakers. A study for the European Parliament that I co-wrote shows that only 11% of adults of working age in the EU claim to know English very well, far less than the 40% claimed by Johnson.\nNative Anglophones hold the \u201cmonopoly of legitimate competence\u201d, to paraphrase Max Weber. This is evident in academic journals, where authors are always asked to write in American or British English, and to have their articles proofread by a native speaker in order to avoid rejection. ELF (English as a lingua franca) is not accepted.\nThe economic and symbolic advantages for native Anglophones are immense, and this raises a problem of global linguistic justice that should be tackled, for example, through a language tax, or by reducing the extent of the legal protection of copyrights and patents published in English. Since native English speakers do not have to learn other people\u2019s languages and thereby make huge savings, it is fair that the rest of the world should freely appropriate some intellectual products published in English.\nMichele Gazzola\nLecturer\nUlster University\nBelfast\nThe entire history of English is that of mergers and acquisitions. As Jorge Luis Borges observed, in English there are two words for every idea:  one Saxon and one Latin (credit the Norman conquest in 1066 for the latter). \u201cDark\u201d versus \u201cobscure\u201d, \u201cregal\u201d v \u201ckingly\u201d, \u201cspirit\u201d v \u201cghost\u201d were among his favourite examples.  Fast forward to William Dalrymple\u2019s chronicle of the East India Company, which notes upfront that \u201cloot\u201d comes from a Hindustani word for plunder. The evolution of English takes the path of least resistance. Expect a few Ukrainian words to be appropriated next.\nYacov Arnopolin\nNew York\n\nOil-price benchmarks\nYou summarised the significant work that has been done over the past several years to ensure sufficient physical crude oil will remain deliverable against the Brent benchmark for many years to come (\u201cNew anchor\u201d, June 3rd). Platts, a part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, has led many such initiatives in Brent since we launched the Dated Brent benchmark in 1987. This includes the introduction of the Forties and Oseberg crude streams in 2002, Ekofisk crude in 2007, Troll crude in 2018 and now Midland crude in 2023. \nWe are proud of our role in the evolution of commodity benchmarks so that they remain reflective of the markets we serve. Far from \u201cneedlessly raising questions\u201d about benchmark robustness, our forward-looking work on commodity benchmarks has ensured that they have been robust through every cycle in the global economy. \nSaugata Saha\nPresident\nS&P Global Commodity Insights\nNew York\n\nPakistan and Imran Khan\nYour leader and article on Pakistan (\u201cSoldiers, go home\u201d; \u201cMilitary victory\u201d, June 3rd) failed to take the viewpoint of the government. We object to you labelling Pakistan as a \u201cglobal menace\u201d without providing any substantial evidence to support such a damning claim. Furthermore, the assertion that Imran Khan is under \u201cde facto\u201d house arrest is false. He enjoys unrestricted access to the media and is free to express his views openly. \nThe claim that the army orchestrated the vote of no confidence in April 2022 is unfounded. The removal of Mr Khan\u2019s government was carried out through a universally acknowledged constitutional process. Contrary to your speculation, there is no evidence of the army\u2019s involvement in framing the charges Mr Khan faces in the courts.\nAnd comparing Pakistan\u2019s economy to India\u2019s is unfair. You conveniently overlooked Pakistan\u2019s sacrifices as a front-line state in the war on terror, which have had a significant impact on the economy. Political polarisation and instability caused by Mr Khan\u2019s party only worsened the economy.\nAttacking state institutions, as was done recently in Pakistan, is widelyy condemned. The Economist knows this. The perpetrators of violence will be brought to justice by various courts. These include military courts, established in 1952, and their decisions go through multiple layers of appeals to ensure justice is served.\nMuneer Ahmad\nFirst secretary (press)\nPakistan High Commission\nLondon\n\nCash and illegal drugs\nDiscussions about digital currencies typically remark that cash is in serious decline (Special Report on digital finance, May 20th). That may be true for its legitimate usage, but crooks haven\u2019t stopped using it. America\u2019s horrific drug plague feeds almost exclusively on cash. Cartels extract some $300bn of it each year. Cash to buy pernicious drugs motivates high percentages of robbery, burglary and thefts. \nThe assumption that society could rely on cash should payment systems fail is as unrealistic as relying on horses should petrol supplies fail. Digital-payment reliability has a stellar history. Smartphones that span disaster areas are the future and an incomparably superior solution.\nDismayingly, a retrograde movement has gained foothold in America and parts of Europe that characterizes cash as a \u201cpublic good\u201d and proselytises that it is \u201cin the public interest\u201d to force banks to maintain currency availability and retailers to accept it. Protagonists have an ambitious plan to keep bills and coins as a permanent alternative to digital monies.\nDavid Warwick\nSanta Rosa, California \n\nThe Productivity Genie\nCongratulations to Bagehot for calling out British politicians who fall under the spell of the \u201cReform Fairy\u201d (June 3rd). Perhaps Bagehot could turn his attention to the Productivity Genie. Both Conservative and Labour politicians firmly believe that productivity will lift economic growth and tax revenues, thereby reducing the need to choose between higher taxes or reduced public services. Alas some of your writers seem to believe in this genie too. I have lost count of the number of \u201cthis time it is different\u201d stories on the latest innovation that will lift economic growth. But it always ends the same way. \nProductivity may rise, but output doesn\u2019t. Instead the gains go to more low-productivity activities, like health care, or a reduced workforce, or early retirement, or more messing about (surfing social media). \nMatthew Green\nIsfield, East Sussex\n\nKissinger on Ukraine\nI find Henry Kissinger\u2019s view that the West provoked Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine to be preposterous (\u201cHow to prevent a third world war\u201d, May 20th). The reality is that the West became less confrontational after the fall of the Soviet Union, which was an unalloyed good. Most European countries reduced the size of their armed forces and defence budgets. America was preoccupied by other regions and reduced its military presence in Europe. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons. The withdrawal of America from Afghanistan reduced the presence of Western arms in areas close to Russia. Europe tied itself closer to Russia through its natural gas. Russian external savings washed through the European financial system. \nGiven these facts, Vladimir Putin took the decision to invade Ukraine because he thought he could get away with it, rather than any provocation by the West.\nLars Schonander\nLarchmont, New York\nMr Kissinger is \u201creviled by many as a warmonger for his part in the Vietnam war\u201d you say. That includes his illegal and secret bombing campaign in Cambodia that killed tens of thousands of civilians. An action that helped sow the seeds of the Cambodian genocide, as it drove Cambodians into the arms of Khmer Rouge. \nRather than sitting down with Mr Kissinger to hear him pontificate on matters of diplomacy, perhaps The Economist could have asked him whether he felt guilty celebrating his 100th birthday, when many of the Cambodian victims of his statesmanship died very young.\nThomas Pratt\nChicago\nAlways look on the bright side of life\nAfter mentioning a hyperactive American industrial policy, robust export controls, onshoring of critical supply chains, de-risking from China, a diplomatic commitment to rebuild America\u2019s leadership, unwavering military support for Ukraine and a mission to strengthen democracy around the world, you then ask, what is so bold about America\u2019s leadership (\u201cAmerica\u2019s plan for the 21st century\u201d, May 20th)? It reminded me of the scene in Monty Python\u2019s \u201cLife of Brian\u201d: what have the Romans ever done for us? \nIngo Steinhaeuser\nWashington, DC\n\nPhonetic victory\nThe word plays in your headlines are often  witty. However, the title of your leader on the Turkish president\u2019s re-election, \u201cErdogain\u201d (June 3rd), fell flat. The pronunciation of Erdogan is not Er-do-ghan but rather Er-do-wan.

"section": "Letters", "keywords": [], "author": ["The Economist"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/letters/2023/06/15/letters-to-the-editor", "type": "Article", "articleBody": "The dominance of English\nJohnson (May 27th) claimed that Anglophone peoples must accept that the English language no longer belongs to them but to non-native speakers of English. The empirical evidence does not support this claim. Most speakers of English as a second language have an elementary or intermediate knowledge of it that is by no means comparable with that of native speakers. A study for the European Parliament that I co-wrote shows that only 11% of adults of working age in the EU claim to know English very well, far less than the 40% claimed by Johnson.\nNative Anglophones hold the \u201cmonopoly of legitimate competence\u201d, to paraphrase Max Weber. This is evident in academic journals, where authors are always asked to write in American or British English, and to have their articles proofread by a native speaker in order to avoid rejection. ELF (English as a lingua franca) is not accepted.\nThe economic and symbolic advantages for native Anglophones are immense, and this raises a problem of global linguistic justice that should be tackled, for example, through a language tax, or by reducing the extent of the legal protection of copyrights and patents published in English. Since native English speakers do not have to learn other people\u2019s languages and thereby make huge savings, it is fair that the rest of the world should freely appropriate some intellectual products published in English.\nMichele Gazzola\nLecturer\nUlster University\nBelfast\nThe entire history of English is that of mergers and acquisitions. As Jorge Luis Borges observed, in English there are two words for every idea:  one Saxon and one Latin (credit the Norman conquest in 1066 for the latter). \u201cDark\u201d versus \u201cobscure\u201d, \u201cregal\u201d v \u201ckingly\u201d, \u201cspirit\u201d v \u201cghost\u201d were among his favourite examples.  Fast forward to William Dalrymple\u2019s chronicle of the East India Company, which notes upfront that \u201cloot\u201d comes from a Hindustani word for plunder. The evolution of English takes the path of least resistance. Expect a few Ukrainian words to be appropriated next.\nYacov Arnopolin\nNew York\n\nOil-price benchmarks\nYou summarised the significant work that has been done over the past several years to ensure sufficient physical crude oil will remain deliverable against the Brent benchmark for many years to come (\u201cNew anchor\u201d, June 3rd). Platts, a part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, has led many such initiatives in Brent since we launched the Dated Brent benchmark in 1987. This includes the introduction of the Forties and Oseberg crude streams in 2002, Ekofisk crude in 2007, Troll crude in 2018 and now Midland crude in 2023. \nWe are proud of our role in the evolution of commodity benchmarks so that they remain reflective of the markets we serve. Far from \u201cneedlessly raising questions\u201d about benchmark robustness, our forward-looking work on commodity benchmarks has ensured that they have been robust through every cycle in the global economy. \nSaugata Saha\nPresident\nS&P Global Commodity Insights\nNew York\n\nPakistan and Imran Khan\nYour leader and article on Pakistan (\u201cSoldiers, go home\u201d; \u201cMilitary victory\u201d, June 3rd) failed to take the viewpoint of the government. We object to you labelling Pakistan as a \u201cglobal menace\u201d without providing any substantial evidence to support such a damning claim. Furthermore, the assertion that Imran Khan is under \u201cde facto\u201d house arrest is false. He enjoys unrestricted access to the media and is free to express his views openly. \nThe claim that the army orchestrated the vote of no confidence in April 2022 is unfounded. The removal of Mr Khan\u2019s government was carried out through a universally acknowledged constitutional process. Contrary to your speculation, there is no evidence of the army\u2019s involvement in framing the charges Mr Khan faces in the courts.\nAnd comparing Pakistan\u2019s economy to India\u2019s is unfair. You conveniently overlooked Pakistan\u2019s sacrifices as a front-line state in the war on terror, which have had a significant impact on the economy. Political polarisation and instability caused by Mr Khan\u2019s party only worsened the economy.\nAttacking state institutions, as was done recently in Pakistan, is widelyy condemned. The Economist knows this. The perpetrators of violence will be brought to justice by various courts. These include military courts, established in 1952, and their decisions go through multiple layers of appeals to ensure justice is served.\nMuneer Ahmad\nFirst secretary (press)\nPakistan High Commission\nLondon\n\nCash and illegal drugs\nDiscussions about digital currencies typically remark that cash is in serious decline (Special Report on digital finance, May 20th). That may be true for its legitimate usage, but crooks haven\u2019t stopped using it. America\u2019s horrific drug plague feeds almost exclusively on cash. Cartels extract some $300bn of it each year. Cash to buy pernicious drugs motivates high percentages of robbery, burglary and thefts. \nThe assumption that society could rely on cash should payment systems fail is as unrealistic as relying on horses should petrol supplies fail. Digital-payment reliability has a stellar history. Smartphones that span disaster areas are the future and an incomparably superior solution.\nDismayingly, a retrograde movement has gained foothold in America and parts of Europe that characterizes cash as a \u201cpublic good\u201d and proselytises that it is \u201cin the public interest\u201d to force banks to maintain currency availability and retailers to accept it. Protagonists have an ambitious plan to keep bills and coins as a permanent alternative to digital monies.\nDavid Warwick\nSanta Rosa, California \n\nThe Productivity Genie\nCongratulations to Bagehot for calling out British politicians who fall under the spell of the \u201cReform Fairy\u201d (June 3rd). Perhaps Bagehot could turn his attention to the Productivity Genie. Both Conservative and Labour politicians firmly believe that productivity will lift economic growth and tax revenues, thereby reducing the need to choose between higher taxes or reduced public services. Alas some of your writers seem to believe in this genie too. I have lost count of the number of \u201cthis time it is different\u201d stories on the latest innovation that will lift economic growth. But it always ends the same way. \nProductivity may rise, but output doesn\u2019t. Instead the gains go to more low-productivity activities, like health care, or a reduced workforce, or early retirement, or more messing about (surfing social media). \nMatthew Green\nIsfield, East Sussex\n\nKissinger on Ukraine\nI find Henry Kissinger\u2019s view that the West provoked Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine to be preposterous (\u201cHow to prevent a third world war\u201d, May 20th). The reality is that the West became less confrontational after the fall of the Soviet Union, which was an unalloyed good. Most European countries reduced the size of their armed forces and defence budgets. America was preoccupied by other regions and reduced its military presence in Europe. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons. The withdrawal of America from Afghanistan reduced the presence of Western arms in areas close to Russia. Europe tied itself closer to Russia through its natural gas. Russian external savings washed through the European financial system. \nGiven these facts, Vladimir Putin took the decision to invade Ukraine because he thought he could get away with it, rather than any provocation by the West.\nLars Schonander\nLarchmont, New York\nMr Kissinger is \u201creviled by many as a warmonger for his part in the Vietnam war\u201d you say. That includes his illegal and secret bombing campaign in Cambodia that killed tens of thousands of civilians. An action that helped sow the seeds of the Cambodian genocide, as it drove Cambodians into the arms of Khmer Rouge. \nRather than sitting down with Mr Kissinger to hear him pontificate on matters of diplomacy, perhaps The Economist could have asked him whether he felt guilty celebrating his 100th birthday, when many of the Cambodian victims of his statesmanship died very young.\nThomas Pratt\nChicago\nAlways look on the bright side of life\nAfter mentioning a hyperactive American industrial policy, robust export controls, onshoring of critical supply chains, de-risking from China, a diplomatic commitment to rebuild America\u2019s leadership, unwavering military support for Ukraine and a mission to strengthen democracy around the world, you then ask, what is so bold about America\u2019s leadership (\u201cAmerica\u2019s plan for the 21st century\u201d, May 20th)? It reminded me of the scene in Monty Python\u2019s \u201cLife of Brian\u201d: what have the Romans ever done for us? \nIngo Steinhaeuser\nWashington, DC\n\nPhonetic victory\nThe word plays in your headlines are often  witty. However, the title of your leader on the Turkish president\u2019s re-election, \u201cErdogain\u201d (June 3rd), fell flat. The pronunciation of Erdogan is not Er-do-ghan but rather Er-do-wan.
