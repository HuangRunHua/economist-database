Hungary and Turkey are the last remaining NATO countries to ratify the Nordic pair\u2019s membership. Negotiations with Turkey over the Nordic pair\u2019s membership restarted recently. \nSouth Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, was cleared by the Public Protector, an anti-corruption watchdog, of attempting to cover up the theft of $580,000 in cash hidden in his sofa. The report will bolster Mr Ramaphosa\u2019s political position.\n\nMore than 200 people have been killed by flooding and landslides after Cyclone Freddy struck Malawi and Mozambique. The damage appears to be worse than that caused early last year when another tropical storm destroyed crops and damaged hydroelectric power stations. \nFrenemies, again\nIran and Saudi Arabia restored diplomatic relations after a seven-year break. The two countries agreed, in a deal brokered by China, to reopen their respective embassies and re-establish formal relations within the next two months. That is unlikely to transform the relationship between the Saudis and the Iranians but it does mark a more public role for Chinese diplomacy in the Middle East.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Israel to demonstrate against legal reforms put forward by Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister. Critics say the reforms would undermine the independence of the judiciary and weaken Israeli democracy. The protests may have been the biggest in Israel\u2019s history. Isaac Herzog, the president, tried to reach a compromise by suggesting alternative reforms, but Mr Netanyahu rejected them. Mr Herzog warned of the risk of civil war. \nThe Lebanese lira plunged to 100,000 against the dollar. The currency is officially pegged at 15,000 to the dollar but it hit a new low on the black market. It has now lost 99% of its value since the country\u2019s economic crisis began in 2019. \nThe lower house of Chile\u2019s Congress rejected a tax reform proposed by Gabriel Boric, the country\u2019s left-leaning president. He had hoped that it would raise revenues to help pay for improvements to health care and pensions. \nA former cabinet minister in Ecuador who had been convicted of corruption escaped from Argentina\u2019s embassy in Quito (where she had taken refuge since 2020), causing an almighty row between the two countries. She later turned up at Argentina\u2019s embassy in Venezuela. \nThe president of Honduras, Xiomara Castro, said her country would establish diplomatic relations with China, which means it will no longer recognise Taiwan. That reduces to 13 the number of countries that recognise Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that China claims as its territory. Seven are in the Americas.\nReported hate-crime incidents in America rose by 12% in 2021. Almost 65% of such crimes were related to the race or ethnicity of the victims, 16% to sexual orientation and 14% to religion. \nRon DeSantis, a putative Republican presidential contender, said that supporting Ukraine was not in America\u2019s vital interests. He had previously favoured arming Ukraine, but has now moved closer to the foreign-policy stance of Donald Trump. His comments were condemned by the Republican establishment, which will do him no harm among Republican primary voters. \n\u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d dominated the Oscars, winning best picture. Its star, Michelle Yeoh, won best actress, the first woman from Asia to capture the award (Ms Yeoh was born in Malaysia).", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline":

In a landmark agreement, Britain is to help design and build a new type of submarine for Australia, and America will sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in the 2030s. The deal expands the involvement of Britain and Australia in policing the Indo-Pacific. China said the AUKUS countries were travelling down \u201ca dangerous road\u201d. \nMr Albanese then went to Fiji to assure it and other South Pacific countries that the AUKUS deal does not mean Australia is abandoning its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. His visit comes as China renews its push for a security pact with nations in the region. \nVery cordial\nIt was also a busy week for Mr Sunak, who met Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in Paris. One purpose of their summit was to discuss the surge of illegal migrants crossing to Britain in small boats\u2014Britain pledged money to help build a new detention centre in France. Both said their meeting was a success; Mr Macron described it as \u201centente renewed\u201d. Mr Macron has bristled at the AUKUS pact, though if France ever joins it could become FRAUKUS. \nYoon Suk-yeol visited Japan, the first trip to the country by a South Korean president for 12 years. His visit follows a recent agreement to compensate victims of Japanese forced labour during the second world war, which had been a sticking point in the two countries\u2019 relations. Mr Yoon and Kishida Fumio, the Japanese prime minister, discussed the threat from North Korea, which fired a ballistic missile shortly before the talks. \nPolice in Pakistan tried unsuccessfully to arrest Imran Khan, the country\u2019s popular former prime minister, on corruption charges. Mr Khan, a former cricket star who is campaigning for an election due in October, is holed up at his house in Lahore, surrounded by a phalanx of supporters, who forcefully resisted the police\u2019s efforts. As Pakistan\u2019s economic crisis deepens, many fear a rise in political violence.\nChina\u2019s parliament confirmed Li Qiang as the country\u2019s new prime minister. The former Communist Party chief in Shanghai is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Xi Jinping. He may be more in tune with business than his boss is, but he is expected to be unflinchingly loyal.\nAn American Reaper drone was struck by a Russian fighter jet over international waters in the Black Sea, causing the Americans to down their unmanned aerial vehicle. It was the first military tussle between America and Russia since the start of the Ukraine war. America said the Russians\u2019 conduct had been \u201cunsafe and unprofessional\u201d. \nRussia agreed to extend a deal that allows for the safe passage of grain from Black Sea ports, but only for 60 days. Ukraine thinks the extension should be for 120 days.  \nHungary\u2019s ruling party, the right-wing populist Fidesz, is to delay a session of parliament that will vote on Finland and Sweden joining NATO, even though a Hungarian parliamentary delegation to Sweden said it would back that country\u2019s application. Hungary and Turkey are the last remaining NATO countries to ratify the Nordic pair\u2019s membership. Negotiations with Turkey over the Nordic pair\u2019s membership restarted recently. \nSouth Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, was cleared by the Public Protector, an anti-corruption watchdog, of attempting to cover up the theft of $580,000 in cash hidden in his sofa. The report will bolster Mr Ramaphosa\u2019s political position.\n\nMore than 200 people have been killed by flooding and landslides after Cyclone Freddy struck Malawi and Mozambique. The damage appears to be worse than that caused early last year when another tropical storm destroyed crops and damaged hydroelectric power stations. \nFrenemies, again\nIran and Saudi Arabia restored diplomatic relations after a seven-year break. The two countries agreed, in a deal brokered by China, to reopen their respective embassies and re-establish formal relations within the next two months. That is unlikely to transform the relationship between the Saudis and the Iranians but it does mark a more public role for Chinese diplomacy in the Middle East.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Israel to demonstrate against legal reforms put forward by Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister. Critics say the reforms would undermine the independence of the judiciary and weaken Israeli democracy. The protests may have been the biggest in Israel\u2019s history. Isaac Herzog, the president, tried to reach a compromise by suggesting alternative reforms, but Mr Netanyahu rejected them. Mr Herzog warned of the risk of civil war. \nThe Lebanese lira plunged to 100,000 against the dollar. The currency is officially pegged at 15,000 to the dollar but it hit a new low on the black market. It has now lost 99% of its value since the country\u2019s economic crisis began in 2019. \nThe lower house of Chile\u2019s Congress rejected a tax reform proposed by Gabriel Boric, the country\u2019s left-leaning president. He had hoped that it would raise revenues to help pay for improvements to health care and pensions. \nA former cabinet minister in Ecuador who had been convicted of corruption escaped from Argentina\u2019s embassy in Quito (where she had taken refuge since 2020), causing an almighty row between the two countries. She later turned up at Argentina\u2019s embassy in Venezuela. \nThe president of Honduras, Xiomara Castro, said her country would establish diplomatic relations with China, which means it will no longer recognise Taiwan.
