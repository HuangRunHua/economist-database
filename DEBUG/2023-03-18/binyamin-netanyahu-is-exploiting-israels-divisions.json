It is also a clash between two Israels: the poorer, more religious one, represented by Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition; and the largely secular, more middle-class one, which sees the Supreme Court as the guarantor of the country\u2019s liberal values. \n\nIsrael has held together since its birth thanks to a covenant between these two tribes. The secular majority would serve in the army, build the economy and pay the taxes that help fund the way of life of the ultra-Orthodox, who would largely be exempted from national service and for the most part would study at religious seminaries rather than work. The majority would get to preserve Israel\u2019s character as secular and fairly liberal. Now that covenant\u2014Israel\u2019s social contract\u2014is breaking.\nThis is partly explained by the growth in both numbers and power of the Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox community. They currently represent 13% of Israel\u2019s population. Since their birth rate is nearly three times higher than secular Israelis\u2019, that percentage could double by 2050. Their representation in the Knesset has been rising fast. Their parties have formed alliances with Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud, a once-secular nationalist party, in the belief that the right has greater respect for Judaism. Both the ultra-Orthodox, who keep away from secular Israelis, and the right-wingers, who are part of mainstream society, chafe at what they claim is the control by a leftist minority of the courts, academia and the media. This has in turn fostered a sense that they have never really been in power, although since 1977 most governments have been formed by Likud in coalition with religious parties. Among the Haredim this belief has sown a growing resentment and distrust of the Supreme Court.\nKeep to the paths of righteousness\n \u201cOur community has long been on a collision course with the Supreme Court, which doesn\u2019t reflect our values and rules on matters pertaining to our lives,\u201d says Eli Paley, the chair of the Haredi Institute for Public Affairs. \u201cWe\u2019re not the ones trying to shape Israeli society according to our values; the court is.\u201d Tension has been brewing for decades. In 1999 over quarter of a million Haredim demonstrated against a ruling by the Supreme Court that forced powerful local religious councils to integrate representatives of modern Reform Judaism. The Haredim growl against many of the court\u2019s rulings, including one that forbids the public funding of any event where women are separated from men, as is the wont of the ultra-Orthodox. \nThe last election gave the ultrareligious parties unprecedented sway in government. They demanded that Mr Netanyahu agree to pass a law letting the Knesset override court rulings as a condition for joining his coalition. This new power has stoked secular Israelis\u2019 fear that they are being overwhelmed by the ultra-Orthodox and strengthened their determination to fight for the Supreme Court\u2019s independence before it is too late. \nThis has surprisingly prompted two parts of Israel\u2019s middle class to join the protests: the tech sector and the army. \u201cCommunities who have never been involved in politics have mobilised,\u201d says Rachel Azaria, a veteran campaigner who leads one of the main protest organisations, adding that tech investors are also financing the demonstrations. \nTech is one of Israel\u2019s main success stories and accounts for half the country\u2019s exports of goods and services. But its involvement is deepening divisions within the country. Tech firms, which employ one-tenth of the workforce, pay well because they compete for talent globally. But beyond their glittering towers is a less wealthy society. More than a fifth of Israelis live below the national poverty line (2,849 Israeli shekels a month, or $780), as do one-third of Arab Israelis and almost a half of Haredim.\n\u201cFor thirty years we\u2019ve fought to keep companies and intellectual property in Israel, despite the pressure to move to the Silicon Valley,\u201d says Yigal Erlich, one of the pioneers of Israel\u2019s thriving venture-capital industry. \u201cBut as strong as the tech sector has become, it needs stability\u2014and the government is now risking that with its crazy legislation.\u201d Government supporters accuse tech investors of being privileged bullies and bad losers. If the tech industry has guaranteed Israel\u2019s prosperity, the army has maintained its security. Thousands of officers and military pilots have signed petitions, declaring they would not \u201cserve a dictatorship\u201d, shocking even those who agree with them.\nBoth groups present themselves as the country\u2019s serving elites, the backbone of its security establishment and a main source of tax revenue. They contrast this with the ultra-Orthodox community supporting Mr Netanyahu, where few young men and women undertake national service.\nThe protesters, while zealous in demanding that democracy within Israel be protected, are notably silent when it comes to denying basic freedoms to Palestinians on the West Bank, which Israeli forces have occupied since 1967. This points to another division within Israel: between the largely defunct \u201cpeace camp\u201d, which wants the Palestinians to establish their own state, and the Jewish settler movement, which believes that the entirety of the land between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea should belong to Israel. \nYet another division separates the Jewish majority of Israelis from the Palestinian ones, who make up more than 20% of Israel\u2019s population, but have been strikingly absent from the protests. \u201cYou won\u2019t find one Arab in favour of the government\u2019s plans,\u201d says Aida Touma-Suleiman, a Knesset member who belongs to Hadash, a communist party. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we will be the first to be harmed by any erosion of civil rights. But most of us can\u2019t identify with the protests, which are full of nationalistic and militaristic messages. It still keeps Arab citizens on the margins.\u201d\nThe far-right elements of the government are determined to perpetuate the dominance of Israeli settlers over the Palestinians in the West Bank. This has created a dilemma for the pro-democracy movement as to whether it should highlight a connection between the two issues. \nProtesters have mostly played down the occupation, preferring a more centrist and \u201cpatriotic\u201d campaign message. Left-wingers who turned up to the earlier protests with Palestinian flags in solidarity were discouraged. Instead, the protest movement set up its own flag factory, flooding the streets with them. \u201cIsrael\u2019s flag is ours again,\u201d said Yair Lapid, an opposition leader and former prime minister. But the mood has changed since members of the ruling coalition came out in support of the settlers who rampaged through Huwara, a Palestinian town in the West Bank, after two settlers had been killed nearby. Protesters have started chanting at the police: \u201cWhere were you in Huwara?\u201d\nHow the government and its opponents go about solving the crisis will determine how dangerous those splits become. On March 15th President Isaac Herzog, a former leader of the Labour Party, proposed a compromise. His plan would give the government more say in appointing new judges but not overall control. It limits the court\u2019s powers but maintains judicial oversight over most governmental actions and allows the court to disqualify legislation with a two-thirds majority. Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition has already rejected the proposal.\n He fought the law; who will win?\n\n Those desperate to find a compromise feel they are racing against time to avert a catastrophe. They believe that the Supreme Court will have little choice but to strike down the new laws if they are passed in their present form. The government would almost certainly refuse to accept such a ruling, sparking a constitutional crisis. Gali Baharav-Miara, the attorney-general, also has the power to decide that Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial for strenuously denied corruption charges, is unfit to carry out his duties due to this conflict of interests. Should this happen, the civil service and security forces would have to decide whether to continue taking orders from Mr Netanyahu and his cabinet. \nThe constitutional crisis has already hit parts of the government. Israel\u2019s police commissioner bowed to pressure from the hardline national-security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and removed Tel Aviv\u2019s chief of police, who had been blamed for \u201cgoing soft\u201d on protesters. The attorney-general ruled that the removal was unauthorised, leading to his reinstatement. \n\u201cThese are uncharted waters,\u201d says Efraim Halevy, a former chief of the Mossad intelligence agency. \u201cThe security chiefs cannot take orders from a prime minister acting in contravention of the legal authorities. But then who will they take orders from?\u201d The chief of staff of the army, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, made it clear where his ultimate loyalties lie. In a speech to reserve unit commanders he said that the army will obey orders \u201cwhile keeping to the laws of the state and human dignity, and respecting the values of the state of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.\u201d\nThe prime minister is trapped, says one of his former aides. \u201cHe realises by now the damage being done to Israeli society and the economy. But his fundamentalist coalition won\u2019t let him go back.\u201d \nAs the coalition rushes through its legislation and the protests gain momentum, chaos beckons. Economists in Israel and abroad are warning of long-term damage to investor confidence. Meanwhile Palestinian violence has been growing, both in the West Bank and on the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Yet if the army is called upon to restore security, thousands of reservists may refuse to turn up for duty.\nBoth Mr Netanyahu and Mr Bennett, the former prime minister, are steeped in the history of the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem two thousand years ago, arguing that it was caused not by external foes but by fighting among the Judeans. Yet they have drawn different conclusions. Mr Bennett sees parallels with current events, fearing that the coalition is stoking divisions that threaten Israel\u2019s very existence. Mr Netanyahu thinks that only by staying in power\u2014at any cost\u2014can he prevent calamity befalling the country. With stakes this high, compromise for the moment seems elusive. \u25a0", "about": {"public": null, "__typename": "Taxonomies"}, "print": {"headline": "A house divided against itself", "section":

Last year two-thirds of the town voted for parties of the far-right and religious coalition led by Binyamin (\u201cBibi\u201d) Netanyahu, now the prime minister. Yet on March 11th some 10,000 Beershevans felt angry enough to protest against the government\u2019s plans to weaken Israel\u2019s Supreme Court. \u201cThis is a Bibi-ist town,\u201d says Zipi Stolero, a retired civil servant who has lived there for 65 years. \u201cBut people are marching because they feel\u2026freedom is at risk.\u201d That the demonstrations have spread to Beersheva shows how widespread discontent with the government has become. \nProtests have buffeted the country for the past ten weeks. Recently around half a million Israelis turned out in demonstrations across the country, clashing with police and bringing parts of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to a standstill. A third of all of Israel\u2019s secular Jews have demonstrated or signed petitions against the government\u2019s plans, according to the Israel Democracy Institute, a think-tank (almost no ultra-Orthodox Israelis have followed suit). \nThey are protesting against a plan of radical \u201clegal reform\u201d, which ditches checks and balances in Israel\u2019s democracy. Under the reform, the Supreme Court\u2019s powers to overturn laws passed by the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, will be all but eliminated. New judges will be appointed by a commission stacked with people loyal to the coalition. The government insists this is necessary, arguing that the fiercely independent and activist court has seized powers on the basis of ill-defined laws, in what amounts to a \u201cjudicial dictatorship\u201d. Israelis taking to the streets are convinced that the legislation is intended to let the government pursue a nationalistic agenda that will pander to the religious parties. They worry that an enfeebled Supreme Court will leave Israel with no effective legal restraints on the government.\nIsrael in its early decades as an independent country fought what it felt to be existential wars against its Arab neighbours and terrorist organisations. Today it no longer faces such dangers. The risk is from the battle between Israelis. \u201cI\u2019ve been warning for years that our biggest threat is an internal one,\u201d says a former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, who led an unwieldy coalition of right-wingers, centrists, leftists and Islamists for 18 months until last November. \u201cThere are those who are trying very hard to divide us into two nations, Israelis and Jews,\u201d says Mr Bennett. \nYet Israel has been riven by deep divisions since its founding in 1948. First, between the Jewish majority and a minority of Arab-Palestinians who remained within its borders. Second, within its Jewish population, between the predominantly secular majority, mostly of Ashkenazi (European) heritage, and a more religious minority. Over the decades neither gained an advantage. But the divisions have deepened. The current crisis is ostensibly over the democratic character of Israel\u2019s institutions. It is also a clash between two Israels: the poorer, more religious one, represented by Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition; and the largely secular, more middle-class one, which sees the Supreme Court as the guarantor of the country\u2019s liberal values. \n\nIsrael has held together since its birth thanks to a covenant between these two tribes. The secular majority would serve in the army, build the economy and pay the taxes that help fund the way of life of the ultra-Orthodox, who would largely be exempted from national service and for the most part would study at religious seminaries rather than work. The majority would get to preserve Israel\u2019s character as secular and fairly liberal. Now that covenant\u2014Israel\u2019s social contract\u2014is breaking.\nThis is partly explained by the growth in both numbers and power of the Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox community. They currently represent 13% of Israel\u2019s population. Since their birth rate is nearly three times higher than secular Israelis\u2019, that percentage could double by 2050. Their representation in the Knesset has been rising fast. Their parties have formed alliances with Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud, a once-secular nationalist party, in the belief that the right has greater respect for Judaism. Both the ultra-Orthodox, who keep away from secular Israelis, and the right-wingers, who are part of mainstream society, chafe at what they claim is the control by a leftist minority of the courts, academia and the media. This has in turn fostered a sense that they have never really been in power, although since 1977 most governments have been formed by Likud in coalition with religious parties. Among the Haredim this belief has sown a growing resentment and distrust of the Supreme Court.\nKeep to the paths of righteousness\n \u201cOur community has long been on a collision course with the Supreme Court, which doesn\u2019t reflect our values and rules on matters pertaining to our lives,\u201d says Eli Paley, the chair of the Haredi Institute for Public Affairs. \u201cWe\u2019re not the ones trying to shape Israeli society according to our values; the court is.\u201d Tension has been brewing for decades. In 1999 over quarter of a million Haredim demonstrated against a ruling by the Supreme Court that forced powerful local religious councils to integrate representatives of modern Reform Judaism. The Haredim growl against many of the court\u2019s rulings, including one that forbids the public funding of any event where women are separated from men, as is the wont of the ultra-Orthodox. \nThe last election gave the ultrareligious parties unprecedented sway in government. They demanded that Mr Netanyahu agree to pass a law letting the Knesset override court rulings as a condition for joining his coalition. This new power has stoked secular Israelis\u2019 fear that they are being overwhelmed by the ultra-Orthodox and strengthened their determination to fight for the Supreme Court\u2019s independence before it is too late. \nThis has surprisingly prompted two parts of Israel\u2019s middle class to join the protests: the tech sector and the army. \u201cCommunities who have never been involved in politics have mobilised,\u201d says Rachel Azaria, a veteran campaigner who leads one of the main protest organisations, adding that tech investors are also financing the demonstrations. \nTech is one of Israel\u2019s main success stories and accounts for half the country\u2019s exports of goods and services. But its involvement is deepening divisions within the country. Tech firms, which employ one-tenth of the workforce, pay well because they compete for talent globally. But beyond their glittering towers is a less wealthy society. More than a fifth of Israelis live below the national poverty line (2,849 Israeli shekels a month, or $780), as do one-third of Arab Israelis and almost a half of Haredim.\n\u201cFor thirty years we\u2019ve fought to keep companies and intellectual property in Israel, despite the pressure to move to the Silicon Valley,\u201d says Yigal Erlich, one of the pioneers of Israel\u2019s thriving venture-capital industry. \u201cBut as strong as the tech sector has become, it needs stability\u2014and the government is now risking that with its crazy legislation.\u201d Government supporters accuse tech investors of being privileged bullies and bad losers. If the tech industry has guaranteed Israel\u2019s prosperity, the army has maintained its security. Thousands of officers and military pilots have signed petitions, declaring they would not \u201cserve a dictatorship\u201d, shocking even those who agree with them.\nBoth groups present themselves as the country\u2019s serving elites, the backbone of its security establishment and a main source of tax revenue. They contrast this with the ultra-Orthodox community supporting Mr Netanyahu, where few young men and women undertake national service.\nThe protesters, while zealous in demanding that democracy within Israel be protected, are notably silent when it comes to denying basic freedoms to Palestinians on the West Bank, which Israeli forces have occupied since 1967. This points to another division within Israel: between the largely defunct \u201cpeace camp\u201d, which wants the Palestinians to establish their own state, and the Jewish settler movement, which believes that the entirety of the land between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea should belong to Israel. \nYet another division separates the Jewish majority of Israelis from the Palestinian ones, who make up more than 20% of Israel\u2019s population, but have been strikingly absent from the protests. \u201cYou won\u2019t find one Arab in favour of the government\u2019s plans,\u201d says Aida Touma-Suleiman, a Knesset member who belongs to Hadash, a communist party. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we will be the first to be harmed by any erosion of civil rights. But most of us can\u2019t identify with the protests, which are full of nationalistic and militaristic messages. It still keeps Arab citizens on the margins.\u201d\nThe far-right elements of the government are determined to perpetuate the dominance of Israeli settlers over the Palestinians in the West Bank. This has created a dilemma for the pro-democracy movement as to whether it should highlight a connection between the two issues. \nProtesters have mostly played down the occupation, preferring a more centrist and \u201cpatriotic\u201d campaign message. Left-wingers who turned up to the earlier protests with Palestinian flags in solidarity were discouraged. Instead, the protest movement set up its own flag factory, flooding the streets with them. \u201cIsrael\u2019s flag is ours again,\u201d said Yair Lapid, an opposition leader and former prime minister. But the mood has changed since members of the ruling coalition came out in support of the settlers who rampaged through Huwara, a Palestinian town in the West Bank, after two settlers had been killed nearby. Protesters have started chanting at the police: \u201cWhere were you in Huwara?\u201d\nHow the government and its opponents go about solving the crisis will determine how dangerous those splits become. On March 15th President Isaac Herzog, a former leader of the Labour Party, proposed a compromise. His plan would give the government more say in appointing new judges but not overall control. It limits the court\u2019s powers but maintains judicial oversight over most governmental actions and allows the court to disqualify legislation with a two-thirds majority. Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition has already rejected the proposal.\n He fought the law; who will win?\n\n Those desperate to find a compromise feel they are racing against time to avert a catastrophe. They believe that the Supreme Court will have little choice but to strike down the new laws if they are passed in their present form. The government would almost certainly refuse to accept such a ruling, sparking a constitutional crisis. Gali Baharav-Miara, the attorney-general, also has the power to decide that Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial for strenuously denied corruption charges, is unfit to carry out his duties due to this conflict of interests. Should this happen, the civil service and security forces would have to decide whether to continue taking orders from Mr Netanyahu and his cabinet. \nThe constitutional crisis has already hit parts of the government. Israel\u2019s police commissioner bowed to pressure from the hardline national-security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and removed Tel Aviv\u2019s chief of police, who had been blamed for \u201cgoing soft\u201d on protesters. The attorney-general ruled that the removal was unauthorised, leading to his reinstatement. \n\u201cThese are uncharted waters,\u201d says Efraim Halevy, a former chief of the Mossad intelligence agency. \u201cThe security chiefs cannot take orders from a prime minister acting in contravention of the legal authorities. But then who will they take orders from?\u201d The chief of staff of the army, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, made it clear where his ultimate loyalties lie. In a speech to reserve unit commanders he said that the army will obey orders \u201cwhile keeping to the laws of the state and human dignity, and respecting the values of the state of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.\u201d\nThe prime minister is trapped, says one of his former aides. \u201cHe realises by now the damage being done to Israeli society and the economy. But his fundamentalist coalition won\u2019t let him go back.\u201d \nAs the coalition rushes through its legislation and the protests gain momentum, chaos beckons. Economists in Israel and abroad are warning of long-term damage to investor confidence. Meanwhile Palestinian violence has been growing, both in the West Bank and on the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Yet if the army is called upon to restore security, thousands of reservists may refuse to turn up for duty.\nBoth Mr Netanyahu and Mr Bennett, the former prime minister, are steeped in the history of the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem two thousand years ago, arguing that it was caused not by external foes but by fighting among the Judeans. Yet they have drawn different conclusions. Mr Bennett sees parallels with current events, fearing that the coalition is stoking divisions that threaten Israel\u2019s very existence. Mr Netanyahu thinks that only by staying in power\u2014at any cost\u2014can he prevent calamity befalling the country. With stakes this high, compromise for the moment seems elusive. \u25a0", "description": "The tensions are not new but they are at a crisis point", "ogDescription": "The tensions are not new but they are at a crisis point", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230318_MAP001.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-03-16T12:07:47Z", "dateModified": "2023-03-16T15:59:35Z", "dateCreated": "2023-03-14T17:36:03Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-03-18T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "BEERSHEVA AND JERUSALEM", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/d7d3lnp24vamhq4qtpa5j862l4djedn1", "publication": [{"id": "/content/b1njv1j4fdamsoq0npn9h6ijj74qujih", "context": {"position": 1000.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/m1f0tegasvmhvcoi0h5pinhi0sdfhenu", "context": {"position": 550.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0r2fj5okc06vcptj21qrdgpojbuuah0j", "context": {"position": 520.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ruoi43f3solop4v2b03i7but8rjn04im", "context": {"position": 1000.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2fcj9k00d8d714lqktealp7fokod2dab", "context": {"position": 495.34000000000003, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2q7kn4fqvoesighb60m2cgt5vbopofm9", "context": {"position": 550.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/n68kh1d25c2fane3r7dvqhu43hcbb04o", "context": {"position": 1000.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "How an east African country became an odd sort of global powerhouse", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/16/how-an-east-african-country-became-an-odd-sort-of-global-powerhouse", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4fqoeasv9vjm1sm4bq3t3nar8ci06m2p", "publication": [{"id": "/content/b1njv1j4fdamsoq0npn9h6ijj74qujih", "context": {"position": 1000.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/m1f0tegasvmhvcoi0h5pinhi0sdfhenu", "context": {"position": 550.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0r2fj5okc06vcptj21qrdgpojbuuah0j", "context": {"position": 520.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ruoi43f3solop4v2b03i7but8rjn04im", "context": {"position": 1000.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2fcj9k00d8d714lqktealp7fokod2dab", "context": {"position": 495.32000000000005, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2q7kn4fqvoesighb60m2cgt5vbopofm9", "context": {"position": 550.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/n68kh1d25c2fane3r7dvqhu43hcbb04o", "context": {"position": 1000.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Binyamin Netanyahu is exploiting Israel\u2019s divisions", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/16/binyamin-netanyahu-is-exploiting-israels-divisions", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
