These instructions can be shortened to \u201cPlease put your trays up\u201d and \u201cPlease take your things.\u201d \nRedundancy is widely seen as a stylistic sin. \u201cOmit needless words\u201d is perhaps the least redundant statement of this view, made famous by \u201cThe Elements of Style\u201d, a bestselling usage manual published in 1959. In it, E.B. White, an essayist and novelist, attributed the dictum to his university English teacher, William Strunk. In the classroom, Strunk \u201comitted so many needless words\u201d that he was often \u201cleft with nothing more to say, yet with time to fill\u201d. So Strunk resorted to saying everything three times: \u201cOmit needless words! Omit needless words! Omit needless words!\u201d\nOn reflection, though, did he really need to say that three times himself? If he had already said everything that was required, he could have let the class out early rather than repeating his call for concision. That he did so suggests there may be more value in redundancy than meets the eye. Language scholars, indeed, think it fulfils several functions.\nOne, hinted at by Strunk\u2019s repetition, is learnability. Repetition, after all, is reinforcement. Languages that include the same piece of grammatical information in more than one way are probably more easily acquired by children, or indeed adults. For example, the -ed ending on the verb gives no new information in \u201cYesterday, he walked\u201d, because \u201cyesterday\u201d already situates the event in the past. Many languages\u2014Mandarin, for example\u2014do not require such endings. In those, such as English, which do, the doubling up of signals may have developed to make them easier to learn.\nAnother benefit of redundancy can be seen on those trains and planes. These are noisy and distracting places where a brusque \u201cPlease take your things\u201d may not be heard by all passengers. Redundancy makes a signal robust. For instance, spacecraft beaming digital messages to Earth include \u201cerror-correction bits\u201d, redundancies in the signal that allow engineers back home to reconstruct the inevitably degraded transmissions. Here redundancy is a feature not a flaw.\nA recent study of Dutch and English confirmed this is true of human languages, too. It looked at how both languages handle sentences like \u201cShe gave the book to him\u201d: ie, those with both a direct object, \u201cthe book\u201d, and an indirect one, \u201chim\u201d. In both Dutch and English, word order is relatively fixed for the giver, thing given and recipient. But there are also ways of emphasising this information. The pronoun \u201cShe\u201d is in the nominative case, marking it as the subject or giver. \u201cHim\u201d is in the objective case, making clear that it is an object (it is not \u201che\u201d). Strictly, either the form of the pronouns or the word order could distinguish giver from recipient, but most such sentences in English and Dutch offer both. \nLanguages may even adapt to maintain an optimal level of redundancy. A thousand years ago, every English noun\u2014\u201cking\u201d, say, or \u201cAlfred\u201d\u2014changed forms, as \u201che\u201d does to \u201chim\u201d, to show which role every word played in a sentence (subject, direct object and so on). Over the centuries those endings disappeared, potentially making sentences ambiguous. The grammar of English responded by making word order, which had once been fluid, more rigid. And English still employs other features\u2014such as the use of the preposition \u201cto\u201d, or the objective-case forms \u201chim\u201d and \u201cher\u201d\u2014just in case.\nAnother possible use of redundancy is simply to make listening or reading less taxing. If every possible word that can be removed is removed, so that every remaining one is absolutely crucial, listening and reading become stressful. You cannot let your mind wander for even a moment. Such prose is almost too dense with information; even a short passage of this kind would be demanding to read. Sometimes a little room to breathe is no bad thing. \nJust a little, that is. The advice to keep it trim is still good counsel. Blaise Pascal, a French author of the 17th century, once apologised for a long letter by saying: \u201cI have not had time to make it shorter.\u201d Keeping things tight can be hard work for the writer, but it saves time for the reader, at least up to a point. Make your prose as lean as necessary to keep your reader reading\u2014but not more.\u25a0\nRead more from Johnson, our columnist on language:\nIf stigma is the problem, using different words may not
