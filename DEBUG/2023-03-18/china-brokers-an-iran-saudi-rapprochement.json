They were at odds in Syria, where they backed opposing sides in the civil war against Bashar al-Assad, and in Yemen, much of which had fallen to the Houthis, a Shia rebel group. Iran was furious over reports that Saudi police had sexually assaulted young Iranian pilgrims at Jeddah\u2019s airport. Four years earlier, America had accused Iran of plotting to assassinate the kingdom\u2019s ambassador in Washington. \nThen, one day after the calendar flipped to 2016, Saudi Arabia executed Nimr al-Nimr, a dissident Shia cleric. Rioters in Iran ransacked the Saudi diplomatic missions in Tehran, the capital, and the shrine city of Mashhad. The kingdom quickly severed ties with the Islamic Republic.\nOn March 10th the two old foes abruptly agreed to end their seven-year rupture. The deal became the subject of excited headlines in the Middle East and America. For the former, it seemed to signal an end to a long-running and ruinous proxy war. The latter was less interested in the substance than the venue: it was signed not in a regional capital but in China, a country that had hitherto played no significant role in the Middle East\u2019s messy diplomacy.\nBoth reactions were a bit too exuberant. The agreement was transactional, not transformational. The two will remain at daggers drawn, as they were before 2016. China\u2019s participation is more interesting, but still overstated: the deal dropped into its lap. Iran and Saudi Arabia have good reason to praise its role. But it is unlikely to become a new regional peacemaker.\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have spent years talking about reconciliation. Such talks have gained new urgency in recent months, largely because both countries are exhausted. The Saudis have failed in their major foreign-policy gambits over the past decade, whether trying to overthrow Mr Assad or dethrone the Houthis. Iran\u2019s victory, if it was one, was Pyrrhic: it is successful abroad but seething at home, as young people rage against a crashing economy and a corrupt dictatorship.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s priority is to extract itself from its war in Yemen, launched in March 2015. Eight years and hundreds of thousands of deaths later, the Houthis still control much of the country and the war has only pushed them closer to Iran. The mullahs now supply the Houthis with weapons, money and training.\nThe Saudis are eager to strike a deal with the Houthis that would leave the group in power in exchange for an end to cross-border missile and drone attacks. For months they have wanted Iran to press the Houthis to accept. So the Saudi-Iranian agreement may presage a separate agreement in Yemen. That will not end the conflict, which was a civil war before the Saudi-led coalition intervened. But it would offer the kingdom a face-saving exit.\nThe agreement could also have implications for Iran International, a satellite-television channel established in London in 2017 that airs relentless criticism of the Iranian regime. Its bosses deny any direct links to the Saudi government. Nonetheless, the Iranian government has demanded that Saudi Arabia rein in the channel.\nThose demands grew when street protests swept Iran in September. Iran\u2019s regime also started threatening journalists working for Iran International. Last month the channel said it would move its broadcasting to Washington.\n\nNone of this heralds an era of friendship between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Their ideological disputes date back to Iran\u2019s Islamic revolution in 1979. The Saudis will still worry about Iran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes and its network of proxies in Arab states. Iran, for its part, will continue to see a Saudi hand in its (self-inflicted) domestic unrest.\nStill, the treaty may lower the chances of a cold war turning hot. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has reached a similar conclusion. Last year it restored full relations with Iran, having downgraded them after the attack on Saudi missions in 2016. The UAE was unnerved by drone attacks last year on Abu Dhabi, its capital, and worries that it could face retaliation for a possible Israeli strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\nIn America these points seem secondary. The focus was on the country that brokered the deal, not the signatories. \u201cSeeing the Chinese role here will not warm any hearts in Washington,\u201d tweeted Michael Singh of the Washington Institute for Near East Peace Policy, a think-tank.\nThis is an undeniable shift in China\u2019s role. In 2021 Wang Yi, then the foreign minister, proposed a \u201cfive-point plan\u201d for Middle East peace, full of banal slogans such as \u201cadvocating mutual respect\u201d and \u201cupholding equality and justice\u201d. These empty words were the extent of Chinese diplomacy in the region. Now China has taken a far more public role.\nStill, caveats are in order. Much of the diplomacy took place not in China but in Iraq and Oman, with America\u2019s encouragement. China merely helped nudge the deal over the finish line. And it is hard to see how China can repeat the trick. It has gingerly dipped a toe into the swamp of Israeli-Palestinian peace, but no one expects it to wade in much farther.\nBoth Iran and Saudi Arabia have reason to play up Chinese involvement. In 2021 the Iranians signed a 25-year \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with China. Ebrahim Raisi, the  president, wants his countrymen to think economic ties with the Middle Kingdom are a substitute for relations with the West. As for the Saudis, they hosted Xi Jinping at a big summit in December. China is their largest trading partner and the world\u2019s biggest buyer of oil exports. After two chilly years with Mr Biden, it does not hurt to remind the Americans that the kingdom has other powerful friends.\nEveryone stands to benefit\u2014at least a bit. Saudi Arabia can ease tensions with a ruthless neighbour. Iran\u2019s arch-conservative regime can look open to diplomacy. China can claim a diplomatic victory. But the underlying issues remain. This deal is more about perception than reality. \u25a0", "description": "But the deal will not end the countries\u2019 proxy war, nor cement China as the region\u2019s new powerhouse", "ogDescription": "But the deal will not end the countries\u2019 proxy war, nor cement China as the region\u2019s new powerhouse", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230318_MAP501.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-03-10T21:32:10Z", "dateModified": "2023-03-17T19:30:02Z", "dateCreated": "2023-03-10T21:32:02Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-03-18T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "DUBAI", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/d7d3lnp24vamhq4qtpa5j862l4djedn1", "publication": [{"id": "/content/b1njv1j4fdamsoq0npn9h6ijj74qujih", "context": {"position": 1000.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/m1f0tegasvmhvcoi0h5pinhi0sdfhenu", "context": {"position": 550.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0r2fj5okc06vcptj21qrdgpojbuuah0j", "context": {"position": 520.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ruoi43f3solop4v2b03i7but8rjn04im", "context": {"position": 1000.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2fcj9k00d8d714lqktealp7fokod2dab", "context": {"position": 495.34000000000003, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2q7kn4fqvoesighb60m2cgt5vbopofm9", "context": {"position": 550.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/n68kh1d25c2fane3r7dvqhu43hcbb04o", "context": {"position": 1000.34, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "How an east African country became an odd sort of global powerhouse", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/16/how-an-east-african-country-became-an-odd-sort-of-global-powerhouse", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/4fqoeasv9vjm1sm4bq3t3nar8ci06m2p", "publication": [{"id": "/content/b1njv1j4fdamsoq0npn9h6ijj74qujih", "context": {"position": 1000.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/m1f0tegasvmhvcoi0h5pinhi0sdfhenu", "context": {"position": 550.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0r2fj5okc06vcptj21qrdgpojbuuah0j", "context": {"position": 520.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ruoi43f3solop4v2b03i7but8rjn04im", "context": {"position": 1000.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2fcj9k00d8d714lqktealp7fokod2dab", "context": {"position": 495.32000000000005, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2q7kn4fqvoesighb60m2cgt5vbopofm9", "context": {"position": 550.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/n68kh1d25c2fane3r7dvqhu43hcbb04o", "context": {"position": 1000.32, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Binyamin Netanyahu is exploiting Israel\u2019s divisions", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/16/binyamin-netanyahu-is-exploiting-israels-divisions", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
