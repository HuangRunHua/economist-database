SVB specialised in offering banking services to tech startups. It got into trouble as interest rates rose, the value of its bond holdings plunged and nervy depositors took out their money. An attempt to raise capital to plug a shortfall in its finances failed, leading to a run on its deposits and the collapse of its share price. On March 13th HSBC purchased SVB\u2019s British assets for \u00a31, but America\u2019s regulators have struggled to find a buyer for the rest of the bank.  \nTwo days after SVB imploded regulators took control of Signature Bank, which is based in New York. The speed and the size of the failures rattled markets, wiping billions off banking stocks. In a co-ordinated action, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in to protect depositors at both banks and set up a facility that allows banks to tap emergency funds. \nThe failure of SVB complicates the Fed\u2019s path for further monetary tightening. It will now have to weigh up stability in the banking system as well as inflationary pressures. The data for February showed annual inflation dropping to 6%, but the core annual rate, which strips out energy and food prices and which economists fret about now, was almost unchanged at 5.5%, and actually rose over January\u2019s figure. The labour market is also running hot. Employers created 311,000 jobs in February, well above expectations. \nDespite the turmoil in banking markets the European Central Bank pushed ahead with a half-percentage point rise to interest rates, taking its deposit facility to 3%. \nIn the febrile atmosphere, Credit Suisse saw its share price plunge by a quarter when its largest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it would not increase its stake in the business. The troubled Swiss bank had to turn to Switzerland\u2019s central bank for support in the market meltdown, and will borrow up to SFr50bn ($54bn) to bolster its liquidity and buy back some of its debt. \nNot many countries face inflationary pressures quite like Argentina. The official annual inflation rate soared to 102.5% in February, the highest it has been since 1991 and despite price controls on more than 1,700 goods. \nThe British government banned TikTok from all devices used by ministers and civil servants on security grounds, following similar moves by America and the European Union. It is the latest blow for the app. In America TikTok faces a potential complete ban over claims that it hands user data to the Chinese government.   \nSaudi Aramco reported an annual net profit of $161bn. Like others in the oil industry, the company benefited from a buoyant market as demand recovered after the pandemic and prices spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine. It thinks that oil demand will grow again this year, as China reopens and the airline industry recovers. \nUnderlining China\u2019s rebound, retail sales grew by 3.5% in the first two months of 2023, year on year, reversing a series of declines towards the end of last year. The statistics bureau warned, however, that the country\u2019s economic recovery is \u201cnot yet solid\u201d.\nNo jobs in the metaverse\nMeta is shedding another 10,000 jobs, which come on top of the 11,000 lay-offs it announced last year. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp hired too many people during the pandemic and its boss, Mark Zuckerberg, has called 2023 a \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d. Markets approve. Meta\u2019s share price has rebounded from its nadir in November. \nOpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, released GPT-4, the latest upgrade to the artificial intelligence that underlies the chatbot. GPT-4 can accept images as well as text as inputs to generate descriptions and answers. \nVolkswagen increased the amount of money it is investing in building electric vehicles and batteries over the next five years, to \u20ac180bn ($190bn). The investment will also go towards developing software that links smartphones to the cars\u2019 functions. The German carmaker has chosen Canada as the home for a new plant that will supply batteries to another new factory, in South Carolina. \nPfizer announced its acquisition of Seagen, a biotech company that specialises in cancer medicines. At $43bn, it is the biggest takeover in the drugs industry since 2020.  \nThe global battle for dominance in chipmaking intensified, with the news that Samsung Electronics is to spend 300trn won ($230bn) on building five factories near Seoul for advanced semiconductors. The investment forms part of the South Korean government\u2019s plan to support 550trn won of private investment in high-tech sectors. \nBy contrast to South Korea\nBritain\u2019s economy is doing better than expected and will shrink by just 0.2% this year, according to the government\u2019s budget; that is an improvement on the contraction of 1.4% previously forecast. Among a series of measures, the budget unveiled a new but temporary regime for capital allowances and more generous child-care support. It also reduced alcohol taxes for pubs. \u201cBritish ale is warm but the duty on the pint is frozen,\u201d said Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor. \nCorrection (March 20th 2023): The original version of this article contained a chart showing the percentage of domestic deposits at American banks that are uninsured. We should have pointed out that at Bank of New York Mellon the deposits are operational as it is a large, custodian bank and not comparable to Silicon Valley Bank, a retail bank.
