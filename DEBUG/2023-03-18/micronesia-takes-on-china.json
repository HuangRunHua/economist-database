Addressing his country\u2019s Congress and state governors, Micronesia\u2019s outgoing president describes in engrossing detail Chinese efforts to bully and bribe politicians into toeing a pro-China line. Mr Panuelo accuses China of waging \u201cpolitical warfare\u201d against his country. To mitigate the damage this is doing, he recommends Micronesia switch diplomatic recognition to Taiwan. He claims to have secured a promise of $50m from Taiwan, plus annual payments of $15m, to plug the fiscal hole that shunning China would create.\nChina\u2019s shameless methods for holding sway among small Pacific island states are no secret. Yet the level of detail Mr Panuelo provides is remarkable\u2014and surely deeply embarrassing for China. \u201cWe are bribed to be complicit, and bribed to be silent,\u201d he writes. He describes Chinese envelopes of cash and offers of trips by private plane to curry favour among politicians and administrators who \u201cadvance their personal interest in lieu of the national interest\u201d. In another instance, the Chinese ambassador to Micronesia pushed the covid-19 vaccines at the heart of China\u2019s recent global propaganda campaigns so incessantly that the president had to change his mobile-phone number.\nWhen gifts do not work, warnings are issued. Mr Panuelo claims to have received \u201cdirect threats against my personal safety\u201d from Chinese officials. While attending a Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Fiji, he says he was followed by two men from the Chinese embassy.  \nChina, prickly over perceived slights, even from a nation of just 113,000, called the letter \u201csmears and accusations\u201d. But it will struggle to dismiss it. Mr Panuelo has consistently warned of the risks when engaging with China. He published another letter to Pacific island leaders last May, urging them to resist China\u2019s pressure to join a \u201ccommon development vision\u201d that would amount to a new geopolitical bloc. They duly rejected it.\nMr Panuelo\u2019s latest insight is how much China\u2019s political warfare has to do with Taiwan, which the government in Beijing has an avowed readiness to invade. Micronesia, along with the neighbouring Marshall Islands and Palau, all north of the Equator, would be closer to a conflict over Taiwan than the more numerous Pacific states south of it. It is also close to Guam, a key logistical base for American armed forces in the Western Pacific. To prepare for the possibility of war, Mr Panuelo says, China wants Micronesia to align itself with China against America.\nThat would imply a dramatic loss of sovereignty. Indeed, a loss of agency is the predicted fate for tiny Pacific states in the face of a great-power struggle between America (and its friends, such as Australia) and China. Yet Mr Panuelo\u2019s response suggests that is far from inevitable.\nHis defiance of China and his public musing about a switch to Taiwan suggest that on some issues Micronesia has a strong hand. China and Taiwan are, after all, in a fierce contest over diplomatic recognition\u2014on March 14th Honduras switched allegiance from Taiwan. As Graeme Smith of the Australian National University in Canberra puts it: \u201cIf you\u2019re small enough, Taiwan can still be an attractive option. Now it really is as simple as \u2018Give me so many million dollars, and I\u2019m your friend\u2019\u201d. Micronesia needs development goodies, not least to help keep Chuuk, a restive island-state, from breaking away. Even if Micronesia does not switch, China might have to dip deeper into its pocket to keep it on-side.\nMeg Keen at the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, points out that \u201cgeopolitical competition can give small states power\u201d. That power is evident in the \u201ccompacts of free association\u201d that the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau have renegotiated with America, which has long underwritten their security and provided financial aid. All three countries have obtained increasingly generous terms from the superpower, reflecting its desire to hold them close.\nElsewhere, Fiji\u2019s incoming prime minister recently dropped a controversial deal for Chinese security forces to train the country\u2019s police, preferring to work with Australia, his country\u2019s traditional security partner. All across the Pacific, great-power competition means much more development and many more financial choices; countries can pick carefully among them. The Pacific\u2019s tiny nations would rather great-power rivalry did not suffuse their region. But they are not mere hapless victims of it.\u25a0\nRead more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia:\nThe rift in Singapore\u2019s first family turns even nastier (Mar 9th)\nNew Zealand is right to atone for its colonial crimes in the Pacific (Mar 2nd)\nKeeping up with the Tokugawas (Feb 23rd)\nAlso: How the Banyan column got its name", "description": "The Pacific\u2019s small states can pick a way through great-power pressures", "ogDescription": "The Pacific\u2019s small states can pick a way through great-power pressures", "imageUrl": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230318_ASD000.jpg", "imageHeight": 720, "imageWidth": 1280, "datePublished": "2023-03-16T14:49:28Z", "dateModified": "2023-03-22T12:02:14Z", "dateCreated": "2023-03-15T13:59:25Z", "isPrintArticle": true, "printEdition": "2023-03-18T00:00:00Z", "copyrightYear": 2023, "dateline": "", "inLanguage": "en", "interactive": false, "scripts": [], "css": []}, "sectionArticles": [{"id": "/content/7n5p4isad10vbnlboev0ct3rln1l0438", "publication": [{"id": "/content/b1njv1j4fdamsoq0npn9h6ijj74qujih", "context": {"position": 800.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/m1f0tegasvmhvcoi0h5pinhi0sdfhenu", "context": {"position": 800.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0r2fj5okc06vcptj21qrdgpojbuuah0j", "context": {"position": 440.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ruoi43f3solop4v2b03i7but8rjn04im", "context": {"position": 800.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2fcj9k00d8d714lqktealp7fokod2dab", "context": {"position": 800.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2q7kn4fqvoesighb60m2cgt5vbopofm9", "context": {"position": 800.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/n68kh1d25c2fane3r7dvqhu43hcbb04o", "context": {"position": 800.37, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "Micronesia takes on China", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/16/micronesia-takes-on-china", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/52s385qf2o34385fjj7j6f3beisj6i89", "publication": [{"id": "/content/b1njv1j4fdamsoq0npn9h6ijj74qujih", "context": {"position": 800.35, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/m1f0tegasvmhvcoi0h5pinhi0sdfhenu", "context": {"position": 800.35, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0r2fj5okc06vcptj21qrdgpojbuuah0j", "context": {"position": 440.35, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ruoi43f3solop4v2b03i7but8rjn04im", "context": {"position": 800.35, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2fcj9k00d8d714lqktealp7fokod2dab", "context": {"position": 800.35, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2q7kn4fqvoesighb60m2cgt5vbopofm9", "context": {"position": 800.35, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/n68kh1d25c2fane3r7dvqhu43hcbb04o", "context": {"position": 800.35, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "The Anglophone military alliance in Asia is seriously ambitious", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/the-anglophone-military-alliance-in-asia-is-seriously-ambitious", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0qi2jfdbmpo9au65rp623a6mfqf4altp", "publication": [{"id": "/content/b1njv1j4fdamsoq0npn9h6ijj74qujih", "context": {"position": 800.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/m1f0tegasvmhvcoi0h5pinhi0sdfhenu", "context": {"position": 800.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/0r2fj5okc06vcptj21qrdgpojbuuah0j", "context": {"position": 440.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/ruoi43f3solop4v2b03i7but8rjn04im", "context": {"position": 800.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2fcj9k00d8d714lqktealp7fokod2dab", "context": {"position": 800.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/2q7kn4fqvoesighb60m2cgt5vbopofm9", "context": {"position": 800.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}, {"id": "/content/n68kh1d25c2fane3r7dvqhu43hcbb04o", "context": {"position": 800.36, "__typename": "Content"}, "__typename": "Content"}], "headline": "India is getting an eye-wateringly big transport upgrade", "url": {"canonical": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade", "__typename": "URL"}, "__typename": "Content"}]}
