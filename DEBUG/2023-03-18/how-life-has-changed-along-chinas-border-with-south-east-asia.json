He can hear chickens clucking in Myanmar, on the other side of the border. He would once have been able to see the country where he was born and where he still has family and land. Now, though, a steel wall blocks his view. It is topped with barbed wire, cameras and speakers, which occasionally blare out a warning for trespassers to stay away.\n\nSome 5,000km (3,100 miles) long, China\u2019s border with South-East Asia stretches from Vietnam to Myanmar (see map). According to a census in 2020, around 8.8m people live in the areas around it on the Chinese side. Crossing points in Ruili, Mohan and Hekou are bustling. Billions of dollars in goods cross the border each year, most legally, some not. Until recently, people on both sides\u2014who are often from the same ethnic group\u2014could mingle and trade without much state interference.\nBut over the past three years, life has changed along the border. During the covid-19 pandemic, barriers sprang up across China. Most were temporary, designed to keep people inside their homes, lest they spread the virus. The border wall\u2014which is really a collection of fences, walls and barriers\u2014aimed to keep covid out of the country. Parts of it were in place before the pandemic. Now it is \u201cpretty complete\u201d, says Hu Zhiding of East China Normal University in Shanghai. Today it is seen by officials as a way to stop smuggling and other illegal activity. What was once China\u2019s leakiest border has become one of its tightest.\nChina\u2019s southern borderlands were once famously fractious. Locals who lived amid the hills, forests and rivers that separate China from Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam were masters in \u201cthe art of not being governed\u201d, as one historian put it. Faced with this challenge, as well as unknown diseases and unforgiving terrain, China\u2019s emperors never took full control of the region. They made do with pledges of loyalty from pliable local leaders. Where, exactly, imperial authority ended was unclear. Still, emperors made use of the area. Disgraced officials were exiled to the south, where they often died of malaria.\nA few boundary markers were placed in the late 19th century, after negotiations between the weakening Qing dynasty and European colonial officials in what was then Burma and Indochina. Locals probably ignored them. Following the collapse of the Qing dynasty a few decades later, as China fell into chaos, the border became even more of a fiction. In the 1940s American airmen flew across it to battle pilots from Japan, which had invaded China. A few years after that some Kuomintang generals, defeated by the Communist Party in China\u2019s civil war, fled across the frontier, eventually starting new careers as opium-trading warlords in northern Burma.\nWhen foreign travel was easy\nIt was not until 2009 that China and Vietnam agreed on their long-disputed land border, allowing mapmakers to draw a line between China and South-East Asia. The reality on the ground, though, remained messy. At China\u2019s official entry points, passports were stamped and customs duties collected. Guards would patrol sensitive areas. But in between them, especially along the border with Myanmar, a multitude of unofficial crossings were used by locals. They might hop across several times a day, to farm their land, work in a factory or simply meet friends.\nChina grew increasingly concerned. Illegal goods, such as heroin, rosewood and human hair (for wigs), were moving across the border, too. Chinese citizens flowed south, some to gamble in Myanmar\u2019s casinos, others to join gangs using telephones or the internet to con people in China out of money. For a while, leaders in Beijing leaned on locals to report suspicious activity along the border. In Ruili, warnings are still painted on walls: \u201cThe cowherds are sentries, too. Those ploughing the fields are also on duty.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic these efforts took on a new urgency. The priority of local governments was to cut off any source of infections. All foreigners and foreign goods were suspect. Locals were asked to man remote border stations in the forests. Big rewards were offered for catching interlopers. In an interview with state media, one volunteer described the \u201cpoisonous snakes\u201d and \u201cknife-wielding drug-smugglers\u201d he encountered as he guarded the frontier. \u201cWherever the country needs me, I am willing to go!\u201d he said proudly. \nAt the same time, hundreds of millions of dollars were earmarked to build, expand and fortify barriers along the border. Today the Southern Great Wall, as some call it, cuts through fields and forests. In places it has been dug deep enough to thwart potential tunnellers. Some sections have cameras and motion sensors which, if triggered, will send a live video feed to the mobile phones of nearby guards.\nLocal leaders claim the wall and other efforts have greatly reduced nefarious activity. At a press conference last June, a police official in Yunnan province said he used the pandemic as an \u201copportunity\u201d to step up security at the border. As a result, the amount of drugs seized has fallen by 62.4% since late 2021, he boasted. Illegal border crossings for the purpose of fraud, gambling and smuggling have \u201cfallen off a cliff\u201d, he added. His claim that over 99% of suspected criminals were caught at the border may have dented his credibility a little. But residents of Ruili, which is in Yunnan, agree that crossing the border illegally has become much harder.\nAccording to state media, the people of Yunnan are happy with this development. \u201cWe feel that we are secure and that the motherland is powerful!\u201d said a person quoted in the Yunnan Daily, a government-run newspaper. Some inhabitants of Ruili speak approvingly of how the new controls have diminished illegal drug use. Others compare China\u2019s construction of its wall with the failed attempt by Donald Trump to complete a wall along America\u2019s southern border with Mexico. Nationalist bloggers mock the former president. If Mr Trump had outsourced construction to China, his wall \u201cwould have been completed long ago\u201d, wrote one netizen.\nPropaganda aside, many residents of Yunnan are dejected. Ruili, in particular, suffered during the pandemic. It was subjected to some of the most severe and extensive lockdowns in China. Over the past three years the population shrank by more than half, to 200,000, as people fled to other parts of the country, says a local official. Adding to the decline, some citizens of Myanmar were forcibly repatriated. Others tried and failed to tear down the border wall, say locals.\nNow the long way is the only way\nThe people who have remained in Ruili report that their lives have become much harder. Take the watermelon farmer, who would hop across a river to manage his land in Myanmar before the pandemic. Now he must travel 30km east to cross the border at an official post, then 30km back to reach his land. He has not seen his family in Myanmar since 2020. \nOthers have lost their livelihoods running innocuous goods, such as cosmetics or snacks, from one side of the border to the other. Unemployment has increased on both sides, say locals. Goods from Myanmar now must go through authorised channels, where officials apply customs duties. Prices have therefore risen, say traders. One in Ruili complains that the cost of jadeite\u2014the rock which is cut and polished into jade jewellery\u2014has doubled. \nLocals are nostalgic for the days when international travel amounted to walking across a field or through some woods. But many seem resigned to the hardened border. \u201cThe wall is here to stay,\u201d says a businessman in Ruili. \u201cAt the beginning I felt strongly about it.
