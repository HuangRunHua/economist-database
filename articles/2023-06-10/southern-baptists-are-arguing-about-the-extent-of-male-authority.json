But a year later conservatives commandeered the leadership of the SBC, and began to purge women from seminaries. In 1998 the SBC amended its statement of faith to affirm that a wife should \u201csubmit herself graciously\u201d to her husband. In 2000 it said that only men can be pastors.

By the time Ms Brown felt her own pastoral calling, it was clear that her career would be made outside the denomination. The progressive, LGBT-affirming church that she now leads, University Baptist in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, left the SBC years ago. Mozella Conville, a congregant of 44 years, notes with pride that it was the first Southern Baptist church in Hattiesburg to desegregate and that the people in the pews were just fine with ordaining female pastors: it \u201cdidn\u2019t mean a thing\u201d to them."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Complements all round"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Baptist confession of faith is a guideline, not a mandate; local autonomy is central to the religious tradition.

They want to amend the convention\u2019s constitution to bar women from serving as a \u201cpastor of any kind\u201d, not just the top job.

In recent years hundreds of sexual-abuse allegations have surfaced, implicating pastors directly and in the cover-up. And ever more people are leaving the faith.
