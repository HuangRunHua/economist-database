They also had fewer tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Not surprisingly, diagnoses plummeted. Not any more. On June 6th the UK Health Security Agency reported that nearly 83,000 cases of gonorrhoea were diagnosed in England in 2022\u2014the most since records began in 1918. Cases of syphilis were at their highest since 1948.

In the 1500s Henrys VII and VIII shut down Southwark\u2019s brothels, or \u201cstew houses\u201d, to try to stop the spread of syphilitic sores. A study in 2020 estimated that in the 1770s a staggering one in five Londoners was likely to have had \u201cthe pox\u201d by the age of 35, against 8% of people in the provincial city of Chester and less than 1% in rural areas. Given that gonorrhoea is around four times as infectious, a majority of Londoners may have had an STI, marvels Simon Szreter of the University of Cambridge, the paper\u2019s lead author. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Thanks to antibiotics, among other things, STI rates today are a fraction of what the Georgians endured. But London is still a relative hotbed. As in the 18th century it has a young, fast-growing population with large social networks to spread STIs. Rates are no longer highest among squaddies and scullery maids but in other marginalised groups (eg, in the Afro-Caribbean community). A more modern metric is that London is England\u2019s gayest region. Though under 4% of its people identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, where sexual orientation is known, men who have sex with other men account for half of its new STIs.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken daily, can almost completely ward it off. According to Preventx, a testing firm, rates of gonorrhoea and chlamydia among men who take PrEP are nearly double those among men who do not, perhaps in part because they feel it is safe not to use condoms. Dating apps (notably Grindr) have made both sex and drugs easier to find. Surveys suggest that around one in five gay or bisexual men in London have sex while on drugs like crystal meth, which can reduce inhibitions and increase sex drive. \u201cYou can have a ridiculous amount of sexual partners, upwards of 20 in a weekend,\u201d says Ian, who spent many years having \u201cchemsex\u201d.

As well as STIs, \u201cchemsex\u201d carries a greater risk of sexual assault, drug addiction and death. \u201cWe probably have more young men dying of chemsex than we do dying of AIDS,\u201d says Dr Anatole Menon-Johansson of Brook, a sexual-health charity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Georgian Londoners were loth to admit that sex outside wedlock spread STIs.

When men who have sex with men get 84% of new syphilis cases and 72% of gonorrhoea cases, such reluctance is counter-productive. The figures should be \u201ca wake-up call to improve sexual-health education targeted at gay and bisexual men,\u201d says Peter Tatchell, a gay-rights activist. \u201cBlame won\u2019t solve the problem; education will.\u201d\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
