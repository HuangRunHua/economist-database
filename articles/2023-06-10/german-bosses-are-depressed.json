Germany recently slipped into a technical recession. Many companies are investing abroad rather than at home. Chinese consumers are importing less after the lifting of pandemic restrictions than German manufacturers had been hoping. And Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive against Russian invaders is injecting uncertainty into Germany\u2019s backyard.

On June 5th manufacturers\u2019 gloomy mood became darker still when the vDMA, the main lobby group for machinery-makers, announced that orders for engineering companies fell by 20% last month, year on year. A small contraction in GDP (German output fell by 0.3% in the first quarter) can have a big effect on orders for makers of machinery. Yet the fall in orders also \u201creflects the recent deterioration of the mood of the economy\u201d, laments Olaf Wortmann of the vDMA. Having promised a new \u201cGerman speed\u201d in business and economic matters, the governing coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats is delivering what to disillusioned German bosses looks increasingly like a crawl.

And don\u2019t even get bosses started on red tape. Bureaucratic approvals still take too long. A finicky new law requires companies with more than 3,000 staff in Germany to monitor whether their suppliers around the world meet human-rights and environmental standards. It has taken ten years to build the wind farm that Robert Habeck, the economy minister, inaugurated in Bad Berleburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, on June 6th. \u201cWe have to speed up approval processes,\u201d Mr Habeck conceded during the inauguration. He insisted that Germany will manage to double its windpower capacity by 2030.
