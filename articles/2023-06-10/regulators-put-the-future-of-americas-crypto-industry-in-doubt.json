On June 6th the Securities and Exchange Commission (sec) sued Coinbase, the country\u2019s largest crypto exchange, for failing to register as a broker, exchange or clearinghouse of securities. When markets opened, Coinbase\u2019s share price dropped by a fifth. The day before the sec had sued Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange\u2014alleging both that it offered securities-trading services without the necessary registrations, and that it had placed customer funds in a trading outfit owned by its boss, Changpeng Zhao. Binance rejected all the allegations and said it would \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the core of both lawsuits is the idea that many cryptocurrencies are in fact securities. American law defines securities to include any \u201cinvestment contract\u201d that produces an asset for which an owner can expect to accrue returns depending on the effort of a promoter. The sec has suggested bitcoin, the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency, does not meet this standard. It has also avoided making definitive statements about ether, the second most valuable token. But Gary Gensler, the sec\u2019s chairman, has made clear that he thinks most other cryptocurrencies fit the bill. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Absent legislation or friendlier regulators, the lawsuits place the fate of America\u2019s crypto industry in judicial hands. An entity\u2019s issuance of crypto tokens is strikingly similar to the issuance of equity shares. If the organisation does well, the value of its tokens goes up. This makes it hard to argue they are not securities. The flipside is that some cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, do not have such a promoter, since there is no centralised outfit that stands to profit from the token\u2019s growth. And others, like some stablecoins, are used mainly for liquidity, such as facilitating trade within a crypto protocol, rather than investment. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Coinbase is listed in America. Binance, which has no formal headquarters, is a trickier case. It separated American operations from international ones, but regulators say it turned a blind eye to Americans trading on the international platform. The sec\u2019s lawsuit notes a damning message sent by its chief operating officer to colleagues: \u201cWe are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the usa bro.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The exchanges, for their part, argue that the sec is \u201cregulating by enforcement\u201d and has failed to provide clear guidelines on what is permitted. In this narrow sense, they may have a point. If the rules had been clear earlier then years of investment and talent could have been better allocated. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are two big implications of America\u2019s crackdown. First, if the sec wins, America could in effect join the 25 of 45 markets tracked by the Atlantic Council, a think-tank, that have fully or partly banned crypto. Even if regulators create a path for firms to exist within the law, crypto\u2019s value will shrink, as it becomes more difficult to avoid the costly red tape that applies to regular financial institutions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Second, more crypto firms will move to places with friendlier regulation and shun doing business in America altogether. Dubai will be one winner. It has set up a specialist crypto regulator and opened its arms to offices from Binance, Crypto.com and Bybit. The game of regulatory cat-and-mouse is not over just yet. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 60}
