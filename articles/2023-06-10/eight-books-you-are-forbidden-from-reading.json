His satirical guide to seduction, \u201cThe Art of Love\u201d, was banished from Roman libraries. In 1121 Peter Abelard, known for his writings on logic and his passion for H\u00e9lo\u00efse, was forced by the Catholic church to burn his own book. And in perhaps the most famous modern example of hostility to literature, Iran called for the murder of Salman Rushdie, author of \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d, in 1989. For its perceived blasphemy, the novel remains banned in at least a dozen countries from Senegal to Singapore. Book-banning remains a favourite tool of the autocrat and the fundamentalist, who are both genuinely threatened by the wayward ideas that literature can contain. In democracies books can provoke a different sort of panic. Armies, prisons, prim parents and progressive zealots all seek to censor literature they fear could overthrow their values. Bans on books that shock, mock or titillate reveal much about a time and place. They invariably attract legions of curious readers, too. Here are seven books you shouldn\u2019t read."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lajja. By Taslima Nasrin. Translated by Anchita Ghatak.

Her novel depicts the revenge meted out by Muslims to Bangladesh\u2019s Hindu minority after a Hindu mob tore down a mosque in Ayodhya in India in 1992. It observes the Dutta family, who still bear the scars of earlier spasms of anti-Hindu violence; each member of the family deals in their own way with the latest. Bangladesh\u2019s government banned the book. Ms Nasrin fled to Sweden and won the European Parliament\u2019s Sakharov prize for freedom of thought in 1994. Photocopies of \u201cLajja\u201d spread in Bangladesh; in India, Hindu fundamentalists distributed it as propaganda on buses and trains. Yet her novel was less about the conflict between Hindus and Muslims, said Ms Nasrin, than about that \u201cbetween humanism and barbarism, between those who value freedom and those who do not\u201d. The story still reverberates: a temple to Ram, a Hindu god, will open in 2024 on the site of the destroyed mosque."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Friend. By Paek Nam Nyong. Translated by Immanuel Kim.

But its defence ministry includes it in a list of 23 \u201cseditious books\u201d banned for reading in the South Korean army (among them are two by Noam Chomsky, a linguist with radical politics). This prohibition applies to all male citizens for the 18 months, or more, of their mandatory military service. The ministry\u2019s apparent fear is that a sympathetic portrait of South Korea\u2019s hostile northern neighbour could undermine soldiers\u2019 resolve to defend their country.
