The trio of orchards in middle Georgia, that grow 95% of the state\u2019s peaches, typically ship more than 150m peaches to grocery stores. This summer trees are bare and no commercial trucks are being packed. The last time the farmers lost an entire crop was in 1955.

In order to bear fruit, peach trees need 600 to 1,000 \u201cchill hours\u201d a year, when temperatures drop below 45\u00b0F (7\u00b0C). But winter averages have been climbing in Georgia and since 2016 crisp nights have become rare.

Cotton, peanuts and corn each bring in far more revenue. (Peaches generated $34m in 2022; cotton $1.4bn.) Nor is Georgia the main domestic supplier of peaches. Last year California dominated the market and South Carolina took second place. Why, then, does the fruit loom so large in the state\u2019s identity?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Before the Civil War peaches grew wild on plantations and roadsides. On the eve of Reconstruction, with slavery scrapped and the Southern economy in shambles, businessmen were looking to rebrand themselves to attract Northern investment. Cotton-growing stank of the Confederacy, but peaches were sweet. Soon Georgians took to growing them. Since spring came earlier down South, farmers could get fruit to the New York market before others, and buyers paid a premium for that. Yankee investors got hooked on the yellow, meaty Elberta variety, newly bred in Georgia, and by the 1920s refrigerated railcars hauled fruit north.

The fruit symbolised a progressive, sophisticated and economically open new South.

Farmers in the milder California valley offered more consistency. Profits in the Southeast fell. According to farm records, in 1885 Georgia farmers sold peaches for $15 a bushel.
