Those closest to constituents were best equipped to govern them, the argument went. Today, however, Republicans espouse a Goldilocks principle of government, says Bennett Sandlin, the head of the Texas Municipal League, an advocacy group. \u201cThe federal government is big and bad, cities are small and bad, and somehow state government gets it just right.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the latest legislative session Republican statehouses have sought to bolster state power and undercut the role of cities in local politics. Two sweeping new bills that illustrate this shift await governors\u2019 signatures in Texas and Florida. The Texas Regulatory Consistency Act bars municipal governments from enacting policy that goes beyond state law in eight areas: agriculture, business and commerce, finance, insurance, labour, natural resources, occupations and property. Any local laws that currently do, such as tenant and worker protections, will be voided. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Florida\u2019s new legislation will also chill city lawmaking. Local Ordinances\u2014as the bill is, misleadingly, called\u2014authorises businesses to sue municipal governments over any law they deem \u201carbitrary or unreasonable\u201d. While a speedy \u201crocket-docket\u201d court deliberates the case, in most circumstances the government will have to suspend the rule in question. And if the challenger wins, the city must repeal it. Last year Ron DeSantis, Florida\u2019s governor, vetoed a previous version of the bill, arguing that it would lead to an onslaught of costly litigation. But legislators and business lobbyists think they have a better shot of securing his signature this time, as Mr DeSantis cultivates his conservative credentials in his push for the presidency."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such gutting of local authority\u2014called \u201csuper-pre-emption\u201d by academics and \u201cdeath-star pre-emption\u201d by progressives\u2014is new. But for decades state politicians of all stripes have chipped away at specific local ordinances to retain consistency across jurisdictions. A dozen or so years ago the nature of pre-emption started to change, as Republicans weaponised these powers to kill progressive initiatives in big cities, says Richard Briffault of Columbia Law School. Plastic-bag bans, gun controls, paid sick-leave mandates and minimum-wage rises were axed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "More recently pre-emption bills have started to proliferate, many targeting LGBTQ folk, progressive prosecutors and abortion-seekers. According to non-profit groups, there were 140 in 2017. That number grew to 475 in 2021 and over 1,000 in 2022. Midway through this year\u2019s legislative season the tally was already 650."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The assault is driven in part by changing demography in the South. In recent years Democratic cities in Republican states have been flooded by new residents. Texas and Florida stand out. In the year to July 2022 seven of America\u2019s ten fastest-growing big cities were in these two states. That feeds a nasty political tension. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "State Republicans in both Texas and Florida emerged mightier from last year\u2019s midterm elections. But many metropolitan areas leaned further left. Last month a Democrat clinched an upset win to become mayor of Jacksonville, Florida\u2019s largest city. Republican state politicians see liberal cities as a threat. Urban hubs generate large shares of state GDP, and economic power tends to beget political influence. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In some states, rather than merely blunting local authority, lawmakers are stepping in directly. In April Tate Reeves, Mississippi\u2019s Republican governor, signed two bills that, respectively, increase the number of state cops patrolling the streets of Jackson, the state capital, and create a new state-run court district in the city. The NAACP, a civil-rights group, sued, alleging that the laws violate the 14th Amendment by imposing a \u201cseparate and unequal\u201d justice system on the city\u2019s mostly black residents. \u201cThey are looking to colonise Jackson,\u201d the mayor told the Associated Press. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Legislators in Georgia, meanwhile, have passed a law authorising a state commission to remove locally elected district attorneys from their posts. (Some suspect this will allow the state to punish Fani Willis, Fulton County\u2019s chief prosecutor, for going after Donald Trump.) And on the national stage, in March Congress struck down a bill passed by the council of Washington, DC, for the first time in three decades. Andrew Clyde, a Republican from Georgia who proposed the scrapping, wants to dissolve the DC mayor\u2019s office."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some new laws could get tied up in court if critics claim they breach state constitutions. But, says Courtnee Melton-Fant of the University of Memphis, since local governments were granted no powers by the founding fathers, states are well within their rights to designate authority as they see fit. With super-pre-emption laws on the books, many cities and towns will struggle to function as laboratories of democracy. They risk becoming forums of frustration instead. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 25}
