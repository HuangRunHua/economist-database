However, it missed the mark in the most fundamental way. Fentanyl, which now comes to America mostly from China and Mexico, can be easily synthesised anywhere, including in America itself. Worse yet, fentanyl is not unique. There are endless additional synthetic opioid analogues with similar toxicity and attractiveness to drug users. Stop Mexico and China and other drug suppliers will quickly fill in the gap."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The driver of this tragic epidemic is the $150bn spent annually on illicit drugs by Americans; there is no end to the foreign and domestic drug suppliers who will collect that cash.

Britons are also more likely to nativise foreign words, pronouncing them as if they were English.
