On October 3rd members of the lower chamber of Congress disposed of their leader for the first time in American history. Despite earning support from 210 of the 221 House Republicans, eight hardliners teamed up with 208 Democrats to fire Mr McCarthy. Shortly thereafter the former speaker announced that he would not try to regain the title. The coming weeks are likely to be chaotic, and the results of this chapter of congressional dysfunction will reverberate far beyond Capitol Hill."}, {"role": "body", "text": "An embarrassing ejection appeared to be on the cards as soon as Mr McCarthy won the speaker\u2019s gavel in January. As part of a deal with recalcitrant Republicans after 15 rounds of voting, Mr McCarthy agreed to allow a single congressman, at any time, for any reason, to call a vote for his removal as speaker. Matt Gaetz, an elaborately coiffed representative from Florida, had threatened to use the so-called motion to vacate for some time. Mr McCarthy\u2019s recent dealmaking with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown pushed Mr Gaetz over the edge."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cYou all know Matt Gaetz. You know it was personal,\u201d Mr McCarthy said at a press conference after being ousted. Mr Gaetz denies that personal pique drove his fight against the former speaker, but the Florida Republican has faced a long-running House Ethics Committee inquiry into alleged sexual misconduct and misuse of funds. No doubt he was not thrilled that Mr McCarthy failed to stop the investigation. Yet the rebel leader probably had a mix of motives for making his move now."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cHe\u2019s very, very sharp, very calculated, and very intelligent: a political pro,\u201d says Christian Ziegler, chairman of the Florida Republican Party. \u201cThis isn\u2019t someone that\u2019s just doing something uncalculated off the cuff and in the heat of the moment. Everything is very meticulously planned when Matt Gaetz takes action.\u201d Mr Gaetz enjoys the spotlight, and he also raised funds during this fight, which surely made him enemies on Capitol Hill. That is less important for someone who could be eyeing the governor\u2019s mansion in Florida."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For all his faults, Mr McCarthy overcame thin margins during his time in office. In May he managed to persuade the House to raise the debt ceiling, to avoid a damaging default. Then, on September 30th, he pushed through a last-minute bipartisan deal to delay a costly government shutdown. The next speaker may find the job harder still, even without the same baggage that some in the unruly Republican Party felt that Mr McCarthy carried."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The immediate task will be funding the government. The deal to avert a shutdown keeps the government going with a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d (CR) only until November 17th. A Republican strategist, Liam Donovan, reckons Mr Gaetz might be satisfied with Mr McCarthy gone, but other hardliners will not easily accept a long-term funding solution simply because a fresh face is running the House. Government will have to be funded \u201cin a way that is even more anathema to these Republicans than the CR,\u201d Mr Donovan says. Mr McCarthy\u2019s replacement could soon be overseeing a shutdown. Averting a closure could potentially cost the new speaker his job."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Aid for Ukraine, which was not included in the government-funding deal in order to placate hardliners, is the greatest concern for those beyond America\u2019s borders. At the press conference announcing his departure, Mr McCarthy compared Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler and said the current world reminded him of the 1930s. He reiterated his support for Ukraine and rightly criticised President Joe Biden for his past hesitance on arming the country."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But some House Republicans have begun to oppose further funding. Mr McCarthy suggested a quid pro quo, in which aid for the government in Kyiv could be approved if Democrats help pass policies to shore up America\u2019s porous border. Supporters of Ukraine in Congress, who constitute a clear majority in both chambers, are pushing for a vote that would guarantee funding for the war-torn country up until the 2024 American presidential election. Threading this legislative needle could be even more difficult than avoiding a government shutdown."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To whom that task will fall is not obvious. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican hand-picked by Mr McCarthy, will serve as acting speaker and will merely oversee the election of Mr McCarthy\u2019s replacement. Republicans are planning for a candidate forum on October 10th and a vote the following day. But the real question is who among the Republicans has the mental fitness to do the job\u2014and is mad enough to seek it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "No one expects a consensus figure to emerge as quickly as, for example, Paul Ryan did when he replaced John Boehner as speaker in 2015. Steve Scalise, the second-ranked Republican in the House, has thrown his hat in the ring. So has Jim Jordan, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has credibility with the right as a former Freedom Caucus head who managed to work productively with McCarthy allies. Kevin Hern seems to want the job, too: he leads the Republican Study Committee, which counts a majority of the House party as members. Yet uncertainty could pave the way for a dark horse. (Marjorie Taylor Greene, a prominent member of the Republican berserker caucus, tweeted that the only candidate she was supporting for speaker was Donald Trump.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The chaos and intrigue will be as entertaining as any episode of \u201cThe West Wing\u201d, a Washington-focused television drama.
