Motivated by a belief in the power of markets, globalisation took off in the 1990s. Governments loosened controls on travel, investment and trade. In 2001 China acceded to the World Trade Organisation, turbocharging trade between Asia and the West. The changes brought many benefits, reducing poverty and inequality, and were accompanied by a growing political freedom worldwide (see chart).

Many believed that the crisis had demonstrated the dangers of free-flowing capital markets. Politicians talked about restraining housing booms, and of doing more to tame finance. Globalisation slowed; Britain voted for Brexit; then America and China embarked on a trade war. But fundamentally it continued much as before."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now, though, a radical alternative really is taking shape. Some call it \u201cglobal resilience\u201d or \u201ceconomic statecraft\u201d. We call it \u201chomeland economics\u201d. The crucial idea is to reduce risks to a country\u2019s economy\u2014those presented by the vagaries of markets, an unpredictable shock such as a pandemic, or the actions of a geopolitical opponent. Supporters say this will produce a world that is safer, fairer and greener. This special report will argue that it will, in large part, create the opposite. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Homeland economics is a response to four big shocks. First, the economy. If the financial crisis of 2007-09 broke confidence in the old model, the global recession of 2020 sealed the deal. During the pandemic, supply chains buckled, adding to inflation by raising the cost of imports. A system that had once seemed to deliver efficiency and convenience had turned into a source of instability. The pandemic also encouraged people to believe that governments should do more. Second, geopolitical shocks. America and China are sparring with increasing ferocity, using a variety of economic sanctions. Russia has launched the biggest land war in Europe since 1945. Gone is the notion that economic integration would lead to political integration. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That war, in turn, led to the third shock: energy. Vladimir Putin\u2019s weaponisation of his country\u2019s hydrocarbon supplies has convinced many politicians that they must secure alternatives, not just of energy but of \u201cstrategic\u201d commodities in general. And then the fourth shock: generative ai, which may pose a threat to workers. This has compounded a sense that the modern economy is stacked against the average person. By historical standards, inequalities of income and wealth are high. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Homeland economics wants to protect the world from similar shocks in the future. It wants to keep the benefits of globalisation, with its emphasis on efficiency and low prices, but avoid the downsides: the uncertainty and unfairness of the previous system.

Mr Sullivan was signalling that control of the economy had shifted to the geo-strategists. Other leaders have made similar statements. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, boasts that the European Union (eu) is \u201cthe first major economy to set out a strategy on economic security\u201d.

Some, following the protectionist policies of the 1930s and President Donald Trump in 2018, are raising tariffs. Others are spending on r&amp;d, hoping to recreate the government-funded research labs of the 1950s that helped win the cold war. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the real focus is elsewhere. Drawing on the European experience of the 1950s and 1960s, many governments are hoping to build up national champions in \u201cstrategic\u201d industries\u2014not coal and steel, as before, but computer chips, electric vehicles and ai. They are implementing huge subsidies and domestic-content requirements to encourage production at home. Says Mr Sullivan, \u201cThe gains of trade\u2026failed to reach a lot of working people\u201d\u2014best, therefore, to limit it. As in the cold war, Western governments are using economic tools to weaken geopolitical adversaries, including bans on exports and international investment, especially when it involves \u201cdual-use\u201d technologies, for civilian and military application. They have also pledged massive support for clean technologies in the fight against climate change. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A few pieces of legislation have grabbed the headlines. Under President Joe Biden, America has implemented the chips Act, to help the domestic semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act (ira), which has less to do with inflation than with subsidising green energy.

In contrast to the past, when poor countries used industrial policy as a development tool, now rich countries have the lion\u2019s share of industrial policies. According to our analysis of data from the Manifesto Project, a research effort to collect information on political manifestos, interest in industrial policy is soaring.

In the first quarter of 2023, we estimate that firms across the rich world received about 40% more subsidy cash than was normal in the years before the pandemic. In the second quarter America spent $25bn on subsidies. According to ubs, a bank, governments in seven big economies have earmarked up to $400bn for the semiconductor industry over the next decade. Since 2020 governments have allocated $1.3trn to support clean-energy investment. America\u2019s spending on industrial policy, relative to gdp, is likely to remain some way behind that in communist China, but it is already rivalling that of France.

Beneath the apparent reasonableness, there is a deep incoherence. It is based on an overly pessimistic reading of neoliberal globalisation, which in fact held great benefits for most of the world.
