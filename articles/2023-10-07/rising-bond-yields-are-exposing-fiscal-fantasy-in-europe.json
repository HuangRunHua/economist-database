America\u2019s ten-year Treasury yields, at about 4.7%, are at their highest since 2007. The Bank of Japan has ramped up its bond purchases to maintain its cap on yields. In Europe on October 4th the yield on ten-year German Bunds crossed 3% for the first time in more than a decade. Those on Italian debt are nearly 5%\u2014the highest since the tail-end of the euro zone\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis in 2012. And that is a worry, because Italy is one of the bloc\u2019s most indebted member states and its government has not woken up to how its spending plans now look unsustainable. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Over the past 15 months a surge in inflation in the euro zone has been met by dramatic action from the European Central Bank (ecb), which has raised rates by 4.5 percentage points. Look at public spending, though, and you would not know that a battle against inflation is raging. Budgets ballooned in several big European countries as governments sought to help their citizens recover from lockdowns and an energy crunch. But even as those shocks have faded, deficits have remained wide. France projects a budget shortfall of nearly 5% of gdp this year, and 4.4% next. Italy plans to run a deficit of 5.3% this year, and 4.3% in 2024. Its shortfall comes even as the country is on course to receive nearly \u20ac70bn ($74bn), equivalent to another 2% of annual Gdp, from the eu\u2019s common pandemic-recovery fund.

If it runs too wide a deficit, or faces too high an interest rate, the debt will become unmanageable. Now it is in danger of both. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Investors are well attuned to these risks, which is why they extract a premium for lending to Italy, compared with lending to Germany. When Italy\u2019s government, led by Giorgia Meloni, revealed its budget plans on September 27th, that yield-spread duly went up. Unless she reins in spending, Ms Meloni looks set on a collision course with the European Commission, the central bank and investors. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In an ideal world, Italy would follow the eu\u2019s fiscal rules, designed to ensure that its public finances stay out of danger. Alas, this will be hard to pull off. For a start, the rules are not realistic. To expect Italy to hit a debt-to-gdp target of 60% over a set number of years, as they do, is ridiculous. Although the European Commission hopes to overhaul those rules, hawkish northern countries are loth to give much ground. The result is standstill.

The role of the central bank is far clearer than it was during the depths of the euro zone\u2019s debt meltdown. Should spreads on government debt start to spiral out of control, the ecb has committed itself to buying that debt. In July last year the bank also said it would seek to aid the smooth transmission of monetary policy, by buying a country\u2019s debt if spreads rise by more than it deems to be warranted by economic fundamentals.

Its programmes come into force only if the country in question accepts budgetary discipline. The central bank\u2019s focus is unwarranted rises in spreads, rather than the level of the interest rate itself\u2014and it is that which is a problem for Italy. Moreover, having been an enthusiastic buyer of government bonds during the pandemic, the ecb will soon decide how to shrink its holdings, which may further reduce demand for Italian bonds.

More likely, though, she will wait for nervous investors and rising borrowing costs to force her hand. A reckoning with reality is almost certain.
