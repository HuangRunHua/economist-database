Newsrooms dispatched reporters to El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California, where they described scenes of migrants waiting to cross the border. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be chaotic for a while,\u201d warned President Joe Biden. Yet when Title 42 expired on May 11th, things stayed calm. In fact, migrant encounters recorded by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) fell by more than 70% in the weeks following the policy\u2019s end.

Migrant encounters at the US-Mexico border rebounded by 61% between June and August, to roughly 233,000. Who is coming has also changed (see chart). Whereas about three-quarters of migrants caught by border patrol in October of 2019 were from Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, migrants from those three countries made up a little more than half of apprehensions this August. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "People fleeing other countries are making up the difference. Four years ago, fewer than 1,000 Venezuelans were caught crossing America\u2019s southern border. But their numbers have surged as the country has languished under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In August more than 31,000 made the trip north. It is not just central and south Americans who are coming. The number of Russians crossing the border jumped following Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. More Chinese and Indian migrants are wandering the borderlands of Arizona, California and Texas, too.

During their speeches at the California Republican Party\u2019s annual convention in Anaheim last weekend, Mr Biden\u2019s would-be challengers denigrated his border policies. Donald Trump (\u201cI\u2019ll solve the border problems within 24 hours\u201d) and Ron DeSantis (\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let people in\u201d) made grand promises of change. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The number of border-crossers is just one of many signs that the deadlock in Congress over immigration reform has wrought havoc. Last month a federal judge in Texas ruled that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a programme that allows undocumented people brought to America as children to stay, is illegal. Dreamers, as they are known, already enrolled in DACA will be able to keep renewing their status. But no new applicants will be considered while the case is being appealed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Thousands of migrants who were bused to big Democratic cities, such as New York and Chicago, by Republican governors are also stuck in limbo. The Biden administration\u2019s recent decision to extend temporary protected status to nearly 500,000 Venezuelans, which will allow them to get work permits, should help. But American cities are begging for federal funds to care for migrants, and the election is looming.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 23}
