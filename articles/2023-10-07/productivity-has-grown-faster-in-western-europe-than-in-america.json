Goods and services cost more in some countries than in others, and working more does not always make people better off.

But a dollar goes much further in some countries than others, because the costs of non-tradable goods and services, such as housing or restaurant meals, vary widely.

As a result of demography\u2014western Europe has a larger share of elderly people than America does\u2014and because of differences in holiday allowances, pensions and unemployment benefits, Europeans work less than Americans do. On an hourly basis, countries like Austria, Belgium and Denmark leap ahead. In France, Germany and Sweden productivity has also grown faster in the past ten years than it has in America."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231007_WOF966.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1314.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such adjustments are an inexact science. PPP conversions struggle to capture differences in the quality of goods and services and many countries calculate hours worked differently. But in aggregate, western Europeans get just as much out of their labour as Americans do. Narrowing the gap in total GDP would require additional working hours, either via immigration or by raising the amount of time citizens spend on the job. Europeans may well reject this trade-off\u2014they tend to value leisure time, even if GDP figures do not. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chart sources: OECD; World Bank.
