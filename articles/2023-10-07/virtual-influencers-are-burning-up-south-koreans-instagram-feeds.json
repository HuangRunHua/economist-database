The country\u2019s first, Oh Rozy (\u201cOne and Only\u201d), was created by a Seoul-based firm, Locus-X, and appeared on Instagram in 2020. She purports to be a beautiful 22-year-old who works as a singer, model and a sustainability champion. Appearing in adverts for companies including Calvin Klein and Tiffany, and in television shows, Rozy, as she is known to fans, is estimated to have made more than 2.5bn won ($1,8m) last year. She is perhaps best-known for an advert for an insurance company in which she danced across the rooftops of Seoul.

Virtual k-pop singers are also becoming popular. This year the debut single of a computer-generated girl band, MAVE:, featuring four avatars called Siu, Zena, Tyra and Marty, racked up over 26m views on YouTube. South Korea\u2019s tourism board recently made Yeo Lizzie, another digital confection, its honorary ambassador, replacing Son Heung-min, captain of the national football team."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Generated with 3D-modelling technology and AI, the avatars are stunningly realistic. Rozy\u2019s 800 expressions are based on a human model. The technology has long been used in films and video games, both South Korean strengths, and is becoming more sophisticated. An even bigger change is the avatars\u2019 ability to interact with their audience. Rozy responds to social-media comments and holds Q&amp;A sessions with fans. (Asked how she is so stylish, she answered that you need to know your body type and to have self-esteem.)
