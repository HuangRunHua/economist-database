In Wisconsin the gap is an astonishing $8.8m, because of a competitive race for control of the state Supreme Court in April, which the Democrat-endorsed candidate won.

This money is also quickly dwindling. During the first half of the year Michigan Republicans spent nearly four times as much money as they raised, leaving them with only $146,931 cash on hand by the end of June.

Arizonans then sent relative moderates to the Senate, such as John McCain and Jeff Flake.

But Super PACs lack the local knowledge and network that state parties have built up over decades. Relying on the national party to save a faltering state party is risky: it\u2019s not clear why the Republican National Committee (RNC) would funnel money into entities unable to balance their own cheque book. More probably, the RNC will work around them to distribute resources to key House and Senate races.
