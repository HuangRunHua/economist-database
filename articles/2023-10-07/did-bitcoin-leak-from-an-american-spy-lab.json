Bitcoin\u2019s accepted origin is that it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous coder, who published a paper describing it in 2008 before later vanishing from sight.

Mr Carter and his fellow travellers think they have a smoking gun: a paper written in 1996 by NSA employees entitled \u201cHow to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash\u201d. And the paper cites work by a researcher named \u201cTatsuaki Okamoto\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the paper is more smoke than gun. It is merely a survey of cryptographic ideas that might be used in digital cash. Unlike bitcoin, whose big innovation was its decentralised design, the schemes in the paper rely on an overseeing authority. It discusses the risks that electronic cash would pose to taxation and law enforcement. \u201cThus the idea that the NSA would develop a decentralised, trustless cryptocurrency as a \u2018monetary bioweapon\u2019 that would impair their own government\u2019s functions\u201d is implausible,\u201d writes David Rosenthal, a cryptocurrency sceptic, on his blog."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Just another conspiracy theory, then? Almost certainly. But something similar has happened before. In 1997 it emerged that Clifford Cocks, a mathematician at GCHQ, Britain\u2019s NSA equivalent, had secretly invented a vital cryptographic technology that underlies both bitcoin and the internet in general, several years before the trio of American researchers who had been given credit.
