For similar reasons journalists write a lot of books about journalism. Film-makers and journalists are often reflective folk, for example. Although they explore distant terrain, their native ground is also fascinating. Fewer people may read books about journalism than watch movies about movies, but the trade has a glamour and importance that make it of interest to a wide public. Unsurprisingly, the number of candidates for a recommendation list such as this is large. Our selection thus excludes many very good books. We\u2019ve gone for variety. Our recommended reads include a self-lacerating essay, a couple of memoirs, a novel and a collection of \u201cgonzo\u201d stories, which are not strictly speaking about journalism but invite readers to ponder the craft.

By Edward Behr. Hodder &amp; Stoughton; out of print."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The title of Edward Behr\u2019s memoir was intended to provoke. The American publisher cautiously went for \u201cBearings: A Foreign Correspondent\u2019s Life Behind the Lines\u201d. But the crude British version is truer to the time and theme. Behr, a British reporter for Time after the second world war, wrote his memoir in an era when the Daily Express could cable a war reporter about a rival from the Daily Mail: \u201cMAIL MAN SHOT. WHY YOU UNSHOT?\u201d He heard the call for an Anglophone rape victim from a fellow reporter as they wandered through a crowd of Belgian evacuees during the collapse of colonialism in Congo in the 1960s. It is one of many darkly comic moments in this fantastic book, which, though out of print, is still passed around by foreign correspondents covering the trickier parts of the world. Whereas many memoirs depict war correspondents in a heroic light, Behr\u2019s shows the reality of drinking, underhand competition and, often, fabrication. It is better even than Evelyn Waugh\u2019s magnificent novel \u201cScoop\u201d, if only because it is entirely believable."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Great Shark Hunt: Strange Tales from a Strange Time.

Thompson (pictured) is among the least celebrated today. Tom Wolfe came to be seen as the great chronicler of American foibles. Joan Didion was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama. Thompson killed himself in 2005, having done nothing of note for decades.

Not everything in the book is great. But Thompson is often funny and is far more thoughtful than his crazed image suggests. His sober essay of 1967 about the drug scene in San Francisco, \u201cThe \u2018Hashbury\u2019 is the Capital of the Hippies\u201d, does not dwell on the social and psychological wreckage, as did Didion\u2019s \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem\u201d. Instead, Thompson coolly dismisses the Haight-Ashbury hippies as \u201clittle more than a freak show and a soft-sell advertisement for what is happening all around them\u201d. The loosening of American mores was the real story, he thought. He would be proved right."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Travels with Myself and Another. By Martha Gellhorn. Penguin; 320 pages; $17.

Hilariously, Gellhorn refers to her early travelling partner as UC, the \u201cUnwilling Companion\u201d. This, of course, is Ernest Hemingway, whom she married in 1940 and divorced in 1945. She is incapable of writing a boring paragraph: her prose zips along at the relentless clip of a Howard Hawks comedy. The reader is barely recovering from the impact of one sentence when the next one arrives to smack them in the face. Her life seems to have run along at a similar speed. In China she finds Zhou Enlai, later number two in China\u2019s communist government, to be brilliant. Chiang Kai-shek, who came to rule Taiwan after the communists chased his army out of the mainland, and his wife are insufferable. Gellhorn thinks they are cosying up to her to get at \u201cmy friends\u2026the Roosevelts\u201d; the Chiangs fail to understand that Washington \u201cdoesn\u2019t work that way\u201d.

Without naming the paper concerned, Mr Frayn\u2014who went on to become one of Britain\u2019s most celebrated comic playwrights\u2014writes of the drudges, among them the protagonist John Dyson, who compile crosswords, nature notes and other humble articles. The work is made bearable only by frequent visits to nearby hostelries for refreshment. The narrative is completed with tales of expense fiddling, foreign junkets and a drawn-out (unsuccessful) effort by the editor to sack one of his hapless staff. Yet sombreness underlies the satire. Money and power are shifting from Fleet Street to television, then a glamorous new medium that Dyson is desperate to be part of. Now broadcast television may be due for a similarly elegiac satire.
