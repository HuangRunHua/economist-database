After 13 years of Tory government, Mr Sunak will fight the next election insisting that the Conservatives are agents of transformation. \u201cIt is time for a change and we are it,\u201d he declared at his party\u2019s annual conference in Manchester. Out with HS2, an expensive and much-delayed rail project. Out with smoking, with the legal age to buy cigarettes set to ratchet up each year. Out with the current post-16 school curriculum, perhaps. Before the conference Mr Sunak had junked deadlines for households to meet net-zero targets. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Few in Manchester had much expectation of this transforming their prospects. The best that loyalists are hoping for is a hung parliament. Indeed, the bars and fringes were strikingly unfussed by how to fight the election. Another topic dominated: the battle for the party that would follow defeat. Its shape is already discernible. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The party has been trending to the right on culture for years, ever since Brexit, but Mr Sunak\u2019s new strategy has made it more strident still. Notwithstanding the prime minister\u2019s ambitions to write the global rule book for artificial intelligence, his science secretary\u2019s speech was billed by Tory HQ as \u201ckicking woke ideology out of science\u201d. Notwithstanding the fact that one of the government\u2019s five priorities is NHS waiting times, the health secretary focused on sex-based terminology in health care.

Claire Coutinho, the environment secretary and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr Sunak, claimed without basis that Labour would introduce a meat tax, noting that Sir Keir Starmer, the opposition leader, doesn\u2019t eat it.

British cities could \u201cgo the way of San Francisco or Seattle\u201d, she said, an allusion that may be lost on Britons without access to Fox News. Ms Braverman is a standard-bearer for leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, which will become a litmus test for the next Tory leader, and which may split the party as Brexit did. Rhetoric is a ratchet; norms that are set in a weekend can take years to unwind. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Conservative Party is becoming more strident, then. The next election is also likely to leave it more English and more southern. Using a model built by Ben Ansell of Nuffield College, Oxford, which applies a uniform national swing and allows for tactical voting, The Economist has looked at a series of election scenarios ranging from a Conservative majority of one to a repeat of the party\u2019s polling during the Truss meltdown, which would reduce it to just 72 seats.

If the current Labour poll lead of 19 points came to pass at the next election, the share of Tory seats in southern and eastern England would rise from 54% of its MPs to 59%. MPs in Scotland, Wales and northern England would shrink from 24% of the party to 9%. (Boundary changes are liable to compound these effects.) The Northern Research Group, a faction of Tory MPs from the north of England, would fall from 38 listed members to just three. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But even if the Conservatives tilt right and become more concentrated geographically, the uneasy factional balance that characterises the modern Tory party would not be resolved. The evidence from the conference is that the fragmentation of the party into veto-wielding groupings is not abating. Since moderates and hardliners are sprinkled fairly evenly between marginals and safe seats, no election outcome is likely to make one faction dominant."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As part of our modelling, we mapped likely seat losses in various scenarios against Tory MPs\u2019 declared support for current factional groupings. Once departing MPs are accounted for, members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (whose leading lights have backed a new, socially conservative faction known as the New Conservatives) would still constitute between 22% and 25% of the party. The proportion of socially liberal One Nation Groupers would amount to between 9% and 15% of the party. Members of the Conservative Environment Network, a green-tinged faction, are set to comprise more than a third of the party in all scenarios.

Sunakites were confident, after Ms Truss\u2019s calamitous mini-budget a year ago, that fiscal orthodoxy had re-established its primacy. They underestimated her.
