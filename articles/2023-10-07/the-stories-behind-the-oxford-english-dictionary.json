By Sarah Ogilvie. Knopf; 384 pages; $30. Chatto &amp; Windus; \u00a320"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In July 1915 an ailing James Murray (pictured), one of the early editors of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), defined one final word. He had dedicated 36 years to the dictionary; his toil had taken a toll. Knowing he would not see the project complete, he wrote his last entry: for \u201ctwilight\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The poetic pathos of Murray\u2019s final days is one of many memorable tales in \u201cThe Dictionary People\u201d. Conceived in 1857, the OED was a huge crowdsourcing project\u2014\u201cthe Wikipedia of the 19th century\u201d\u2014comprising 3,000 people. The idea was to create a \u201cdescriptive\u201d dictionary that tracked words\u2019 use and meaning over time (unlike its \u201cprescriptive\u201d 18th-century predecessor by Samuel Johnson, which told readers how to say and use words). Volunteers read widely, mailing in examples of how \u201crare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar\u201d words were used. What is surprising about this fairly random method is that it worked, achieving order through the large number of contributors."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The origin story of Sarah Ogilvie\u2019s book is almost as improbable as that of the dictionary itself. Ms Ogilvie, a former lexicographer who served as an editor for the OED, went into the archives of Oxford University Press and stumbled across an old notebook. It had belonged to Murray and contained the names and details of the dictionary volunteers, most of whom had previously been unknown. \u201cThe Dictionary People\u201d is her work of detective scholarship, evoking the lives behind the names."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The dictionary\u2019s contributors are an engaging cast, including three murderers, a vegetarian vicar, one of Karl Marx\u2019s daughters and J.R.R. Tolkien. Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper, aunt and niece, were lifelong lovers and successful writers, who co-wrote plays under a male pseudonym. For some, the dictionary was an obsession: one contributor supplied 165,061 quotations. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Murray, too, was assiduous. He once wrote to George Eliot of \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d fame to ask about a word choice in \u201cRomola\u201d, published 17 years earlier. (She responded courteously.) Yet he also found time beyond his Herculean project to be humane, paying several visits to one contributor imprisoned in Broadmoor, a high-security psychiatric hospital."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Through the multitude of stories, snapshots of a society in flux emerge: an age of scientific discovery, growing transport and communication links and increased professionalisation of scholarship. Yet many of the dictionary\u2019s contributors were autodidacts. The project\u2019s popularity reflected a growing community of people eager for intellectual pursuits but excluded from conventional academia. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Ogilvie\u2019s book is full of quirky titbits. Many dictionary obsessives engaged in another crowdsourcing vogue: collecting and measuring rainwater. The presentation of the book is unconventional, too, taking its structure from the work it describes. There are 26 alphabetical chapters, each celebrating a group of contributors (memorably, \u201cK\u201d is for \u201ckleptomaniac\u201d). This is a cunning conceit, though it sometimes means that broader issues emerge only piecemeal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe Dictionary People\u201d will appeal to logophiles. Pages abound with wonderful words: absquatulate (to abscond), couthutlaughe (a person knowingly concealing an outlaw) and zwodder (a drowsy feeling). But Ms Ogilvie\u2019s book is also a story of omissions. The OED aimed to record English as it was used across the world; it was a product of empire. \u201cThe published sources of those words drew originally on the language of members of black and indigenous communities, whose names never made it into the pages of Murray\u2019s address book,\u201d Ms Ogilvie writes. In addition, many words were kept out of the OED: \u201chomosexuality\u201d was included in 1933, \u201clesbian\u201d not until 1976. When it came to slang, Murray was cautious about obscenity laws; first editions of the \u201cC\u201d and \u201cF\u201d volumes remain clear of the obvious culprits."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Above all, though, this is a story about ordinary people. It is a powerful testament to those who, to cite dictionary-helper George Eliot, \u201clived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs\u201d. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 75}
