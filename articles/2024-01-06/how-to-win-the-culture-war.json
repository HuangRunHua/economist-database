As Donald Trump and his imitators have made politics more outlandish and offensive, films, television and even comedy, dominated as they are by creative types of the left, have grown more didactic and censorious\u2014thereby supplying more fuel to the right. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This loop has sucked in even some entertainers wise enough to try to stand outside it, at least to judge by the comedian Dave Chappelle\u2019s latest Netflix special, \u201cThe Dreamer\u201d, released on the last day of 2023. Mr Chappelle\u2019s wit is still fanged, his storytelling still absorbing, the strike of his punchlines as surprising\u2014as deserving of the name\u2014as ever. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some jokes fall flat, but that has always been the case. What seems new are the triumphal notes. Early in the new act, Mr Chappelle says with a grin, \u201cI love punching down.\u201d That is ostensibly a reference to a marginalised group he is newly mocking, people with disabilities. But it registers also as a shot at the offended multitude that tried in 2021 to get Netflix to remove his show that year, \u201cThe Closer\u201d, because of his jokes about transgender and gay people. It was among the biggest of the many uproars thus far over where to draw the boundaries for American discourse, and it was also unusual because Netflix held the line in the face of an internal uprising as well as a social-media assault."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The company\u2019s co-chief executive, Ted Sarandos, told its employees at the time that Netflix would host shows they might not like. \u201cThere are going to be things that you might feel are harmful,\u201d he warned. \u201cBut we are trying to entertain a world with varying tastes and varying sensibilities and various beliefs.\u201d Whether the leaders of Netflix took their stand out of principle or commercial interest\u2014most likely, some unknowable mix of the two\u2014they were right on both counts. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For his part, while Mr Chappelle may not have won the culture war, having overcome his adversaries he is relishing the rout. Since the uproar over \u201cThe Closer\u201d he has been filling arenas as well as theatres, benefiting too from fans\u2019 growing enthusiasm for live experiences. According to the Wall Street Journal he earned more in ticket sales last year than any other touring comedy act\u2014at least $62m, a total that does not include all his events. \u201cThe Dreamer\u201d almost immediately was listed as the most popular Netflix show in America. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the new show, Mr Chappelle says he is done telling jokes about gay and transgender people, before catching himself: \u201cMaybe three or four times tonight\u2014but that is it!\u201d He knows that his fans expect such jokes. So do his adversaries, though snide reviews of \u201cThe Dreamer\u201d from leftish publications have sounded less enraged than resigned. Everyone is going through the motions. On both sides the furious battles of yesteryear are being reprised as shtick. That is progress, of a sort. "}, {"role": "body", "text": " Stand-up comedy tends not to age well. Its particular, backhanded contribution to pluralism is to puncture contemporary pieties and mores, and those change, or should. But as Mr Chappelle attacks this era\u2019s cant and self-certainty, the punchlines can suggest that he, and America, remain a bit stuck. \u201cYou see, it\u2019s a funny thing if you believe you\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d he observes near the end of the show. \u201cYou can get drunk off the feeling of how right you are.\u201d Then he sticks in the now-familiar barb: \u201cThat\u2019s why gay people are so mean.\u201d The attacks on Mr Chappelle\u2019s work only strengthened him, but in repeatedly picking the same fight, he is granting his adversaries some continued power, too. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2022 an audience member with a knife charged at Mr Chappelle while he was performing at the Hollywood Bowl. The assailant later said the jokes were \u201ctriggering\u201d him. Mr Chappelle, who was not injured, has turned the attack into one of his best bits. It reverses his usual pattern: the routine starts out poking at bisexuality, but then leaves that subject behind to wend towards first poignant, then hilarious punchlines about the inheritance he has squirrelled away in a safe-deposit box for his family. Maybe, when Mr Chappelle\u2019s whole act can follow that sort of pattern, the culture wars will truly be ending. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "An American fraud"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A fine new film, \u201cAmerican Fiction\u201d, transcends all this bickering. Thelonious Ellison, known as Monk, is a black academic and author whose erudite novels do not sell well. Enraged by the success of a novel he sees as black-poverty porn (its title: \u201cWe\u2019s Lives in Da Ghetto\u201d), Monk, under a pseudonym, bats out a parody of such work (\u201cMy Pafology\u201d), only to have it rapturously embraced by white literary types who consider themselves progressive. This broad conceit about racial tropes occasions many more subtle observations of bigotry and hypocrisy, as when a white film director inflated with self-regard over his sensitivity to anti-black cruelty casually humiliates an Asian-American assistant."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the film\u2019s most powerful message is that, to be compelling to a broad audience, it should not need to indulge in the conceit about racial tropes at all. Race recedes from the story\u2019s real comedy and pathos, which lie in Monk\u2019s relationships with his equally bruised, witty and accomplished siblings and with his aristocratic mother, who is fading into Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t really believe in race,\u201d Monk says plaintively at one point. The problem, as his agent notes, is that pretty much everyone else does believe in that most poisonous of American fictions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like Mr Chappelle, \u201cAmerican Fiction\u201d argues that people deserve respect not just because of their identification with any broad group but because of their intricacies, because of their facets and flaws as individuals. Politics, with its traffic in demographic voting blocs, has never had much patience for such microscopic focus or even such universal themes. That is why the culture needs to supply them. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics: Why Donald Trump is gaining ground with young voters (Dec 20th)Charlie Peters, the man who tried to save Washington (Dec 2nd)The (sort of) isolationist case for backing Ukraine (Nov 23rd)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 22}
