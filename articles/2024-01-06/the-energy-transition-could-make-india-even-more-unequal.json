Generation capacity from renewable sources nearly doubled in the five years to last November, from 72 gigawatts (GW) to 133GW. The government of Narendra Modi has set a target of generating 500GW from renewable sources, or half the projected total capacity, by 2030. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But coal will remain an important part of the mix. According to a study by Niti Aayog, a government think-tank, demand for it will not peak until 2035-2040. That helps explain why India has given itself until 2070 to hit net-zero emissions. This should provide latitude to develop its economy\u2014and also give the regions most reliant on fossil fuels time to adjust."}, {"role": "body", "text": "India\u2019s mineral riches are largely in its eastern and central states. These are among its poorest places. Without proper planning, dwindling coal revenues could throw their economies into disarray. Neither can they rely on much investment in renewables. In a cruel quirk of geography, six of the eight Indian states that receive the most sunshine and wind are in the prosperous south and west."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Consider Jharkhand. It is India\u2019s biggest coal-producing state, with 28% of proven reserves. It is also grindingly poor: 28% of its people are classified as living in extreme poverty, the second-highest rate of any state. Mining is a big chunk of its economy, accounting for 78% of non-tax revenues. Of its 24 districts, 18 produce coal or host coal-dependent industries."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet of India\u2019s 1050GW wind-and-solar potential, Jharkhand accounts for just 18GW, or 1.7%. By contrast, four states in south India and two in its west, along with Madhya Pradesh in the middle and the desert state of Rajasthan in the north-west, account for two-thirds. \u201cThe power vector will change from [flowing] east to west or centre to south to the reverse\u2026It is inevitable,\u201d says Sutirtha Bhattacharya, a former chairman of Coal India, a state-owned firm that is the world\u2019s biggest coal producer."}, {"role": "body", "text": "India\u2019s energy economy is already shifting. Nearly 75% of the country\u2019s installed solar and wind generation capacity in 2020 was in the six southern and western states. Less than 5% was in ten northern, eastern and central states, excluding Madhya Pradesh. Though coal production and consumption are still growing, coal\u2019s share in the electricity-generation mix declined from 57% to 48% in the five years to last November. States such as Jharkhand face a prospect of having to buy energy from other states, even as their revenues from coal decrease. Their fiscal deficits are likely to balloon, according to a working paper by Rohit Chandra and Sanjay Mitra for the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a research institution in Delhi."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Jharkhand, the state that will be hardest-hit, is already thinking ahead. In late 2022 it set up a task-force to plan for what it calls a \u201cjust transition\u201d. \u201cWe were considered to be blessed because we have so much coal. Today people are saying it\u2019s a curse,\u201d says Ajay Kumar Rastogi, the task-force\u2019s chairman. \u201cBut we see it as an opportunity for the state to plan.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The task-force is charged with devising policies to help exploit whatever solar potential Jharkhand has, perhaps on disused coalfields, and to incentivise green industries such as hydrogen. It is also working to ensure its policies are implemented by the state\u2019s bureaucracy. This is an example to other affected states. Chhattisgarh, a similar case, is said to be considering setting up a task-force of its own."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Limiting the negative fallout of the energy transition will be important not just for such states, but also for regions that stand to benefit and for India overall. As part of its federal compact, richer states help fund poorer ones by paying more into central government coffers than they draw out. If Jharkhand and its peers grow poorer, southern and western states will find themselves footing a larger bill. So far, write Mr Chandra and Mr Mitra, the \u201ccentral government ministries have shown little interest\u201d in thinking through, and mitigating, such economic consequences. That needs to change. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of our India coverage by signing up to Essential India, our free weekly newsletter."}], "id": 13}
