Will 2024 add a crisis over Taiwan? The self-governing island will hold elections on January 13th, as will America on November 5th. Both polls will raise the geopolitical heat at a time of military tension across the Taiwan Strait and deepening rivalry between America and China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many in Washington worry that a clash over Taiwan looms, despite efforts by the American and Chinese presidents, Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, to stabilise relations at a summit in November. China claims the island as its own, and America says Mr Xi has ordered the People\u2019s Liberation Army to develop the means to invade Taiwan by 2027. American commanders, worried about the shifting military balance, talk of a \u201cwindow of vulnerability\u201d in the second half of the decade. Yet conflict could erupt sooner, if the delicate balance between Taiwan, China and America is upset."}, {"role": "body", "text": "America, Taiwan\u2019s main protector, will not favour any candidate in the island\u2019s election. But American officials have long fretted that a victory for Lai Ching-te, deputy to President Tsai Ing-wen and fellow member of the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party (dpp), could lead to escalation. He is leading polls by five percentage points, according to The Economist\u2019s tracker."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China calls Mr Lai a \u201cdestroyer of peace\u201d. Mr Lai, for his part, once described himself as a \u201cpragmatic worker for Taiwan independence\u201d. Of late, though, he has emphasised the fudgy status quo. He says Taiwan is \u201calready a sovereign country\u201d and thus has no need to declare independence. That position still infuriates the mainland, and Mr Lai\u2019s election could quickly be met with intensified Chinese economic or military pressure. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "America has a history of tense dealings with the dPP. Of late relations have improved owing to Ms Tsai\u2019s caution and increased bullying by China\u2014not least a missile barrage in 2022, almost blockading Taiwan, after it was visited by Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives. Still, American officials worry about Mr Lai\u2019s proclivity for loose language, including a remark about hoping to \u201center the White House\u201d as Taiwan\u2019s president, which would break with precedent."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All of which might suggest that a win for Mr Lai\u2019s nearest rival, Hou Yu-ih of the Kuomintang (kmt), could reduce tensions. The former mayor of New Taipei City (the exurbs of Taiwan\u2019s capital) is preferred in Beijing. The nationalist kmt is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s old enemy: its leaders fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war in 1949. But it at least shares the party\u2019s belief in one China (even if the kmt wants a democratic one). Mr Hou accuses the dpp of endangering Taiwan by flirting with independence and promises to bring peace through dialogue with China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Mr Hou might not bring greater calm. He opposes both independence and China\u2019s offer of unification under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement. Most Taiwanese reject that model, which failed to protect Hong Kong\u2019s former freedoms. Mere dialogue will not satisfy Mr Xi, who will want concessions that Mr Hou cannot deliver, like progress towards unification. A foot-dragging Mr Hou could prove as irksome to Mr Xi as Mr Lai. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A second danger, in American eyes, is that Mr Hou might curb the push for a more asymmetric strategy, ie, using lots of mobile defensive weapons to turn the island into a \u201cporcupine\u201d. The dpp has hiked defence spending and extended conscription. Mr Hou tells American interlocutors he values deterrence, but says Taiwan can save on defence and shorten conscription by improving ties with China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Were he to prove more overtly pro-China, Mr Hou might irk America. Evan Medeiros, a former China hand at the White House, notes a \u201cbackground debate\u201d about America\u2019s one-China policy. The United States would in theory be content to see the unification of Taiwan with the mainland if done peacefully. In practice these days it is wedded to the status quo. Pentagon officials see the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d, running from Japan through Taiwan to Indonesia, as \u201cAmerica\u2019s forward defence perimeter in the western Pacific\u201d, in the words of one."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whoever wins the presidency may be constrained by a hostile or hung Yuan, Taiwan\u2019s parliament. \u201cThe question is less whether the new president will enact a radical change in the status quo. The question is more: how will an untested leader deal with a change in the status quo due to exogenous factors?\u201d says Jude Blanchette of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, another American think-tank. What would happen if Taiwan overreacted to Chinese military probing; or if there were a clash during an encounter between American and Chinese forces?"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240106_ASM901.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 776.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "America\u2019s elections could also unsettle things in several ways. One is that Mr Biden, burdened by wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and by his re-election campaign, could yield to Chinese pressure on Taiwan despite his repeated vows to defend the island. Another is that, during a fevered presidential race in which standing up to China becomes a virility test, Mr Biden overreacts or hawks in Congress stage a provocation akin to Ms Pelosi\u2019s trip."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As for Donald Trump, Mr Biden\u2019s likely Republican challenger, he has long been contemptuous of America\u2019s alliances, and has accused Taiwan of stealing America\u2019s semiconductor industry. In his first term he told aides he would not defend the island. Yet it is also possible that his future aides might push to confront China more forcefully, using Taiwan as leverage. Many in Congress want to give Taiwan greater support and diplomatic recognition."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For now, isolationism is paralysing American policy. Republicans in Congress are holding up a supplemental budget to help friends and allies\u2014including support for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan\u2019s military defences. In exchange, they want measures to curb migration across America\u2019s southern border. The budget bill also includes funds for American submarine yards to facilitate the aukus deal, under which America and Britain would supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. Congress has also delayed a full defence appropriations bill for fiscal year 2024, hampering the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to prepare for possible conflict with China. Mr Trump may or may not return to power. But Trumpism is already undermining Taiwan and other Indo-Pacific allies. \u25a0"}], "id": 10}
