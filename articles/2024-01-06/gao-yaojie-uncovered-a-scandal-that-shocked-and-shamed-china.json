They called it \u201cthe strange disease\u201d. It made them weary and nauseous, spread a rash on their bodies and made sores grow in their mouths. And it made people vanish. Muscles and strength wasted away, so that men could no longer work the flat brown fields. Families dwindled and disappeared. Owners of new-built houses never moved in, leaving them empty. Some people, realising they were sick, simply ran away. Instead of crops, the fields sprouted mud-mound graves."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Local doctors were as puzzled as the victims. So in 1996 they called in Gao Yaojie to help. She was nearly 70 then, and technically she had retired. But her fund of medical knowledge, especially in obstetrics and female cancers, was formidable. She had always had a pretty good head on her shoulders. In 1950 she had been one of the first women to enter the Henan Medical School, walking with a limp which she never lost, because for six years as a child her feet had been bound to fit her for a daintier, idler life. Not for her, thank you."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She identified the mystery illness with her first patient. It was AIDS, which was already prevalent in China\u2019s big cities. The puzzle was how it had arrived here, in these remote rural places. The farm folk were not taking drugs or indulging in commercial sex. Her patient, though, had recently had a blood transfusion. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, had come in that way."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Moreover it had come in officially. Mobile clinics had been sent by local government, on Beijing\u2019s orders, to collect blood for hospitals and plasma for the market. There was always a shortage, so donors were told they could save China by giving some of their own. In return for 800cc they could get 45 yuan, enough to feed their families for a week. Half the donation, 400cc of blood, was injected back into them anyway. Donors lined up eagerly to oblige. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Soon enough, though, the trade was in the hands of \u201cblood bosses\u201d. Administration became slapdash. Equipment\u2014centrifuges that separated plasma from blood, syringes and needles\u2014was reused without being disinfected. The blood returned to arms was casually mixed up. At the same time, donors were not monitored. Some went several times a week, some twice a day. The result was the scene Dr Gao chanced on in one village: a young wife who had just hanged herself in front of her little son. She rushed to cut her down, but the body was already stiff. Nothing to be done. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "She naturally reported all this, loudly and often. But naming the disease caused fury among health officials in Henan. Their reputation was at stake. If AIDS was admitted, who would invest there? Local headmen refused to let their fiefs be \u201cAIDS villages\u201d. On every side, those in charge rushed to protect their careers and silence this meddling old woman. No one apologised or accepted responsibility. Instead, she was chased out of villages; but this only made her angrier and more determined."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Life had shaped her that way. In 1939 her landowner family had been driven by Communist guerrillas from Shandong into Henan, where they had to begin again. During the Cultural Revolution, as a capitalist \u201cblack element\u201d, she was beaten up and paraded through the streets with a high papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 hat on her head and her shoes tied round her neck. She was imprisoned in the hospital morgue, and for seven years was made to clean toilets rather than practise gynaecology. After trying to kill herself with pills, and surviving, she vowed to spend her life helping others. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That was why \u201cGrandma Gao\u201d kept going back to the villages. Over the next dozen years she visited more than 100, treating more than 1,000 families. She went as incognito as possible, in her dowdy dark secondhand clothes, and slept in the homes of the poor. No one paid her; she financed herself, draining the family savings. No medicine she had could specifically treat AIDS, but she took along cough syrup, painkillers and diarrhoea tablets, to ease the symptoms, and fizzy drinks and sweets at Moon Festival. She did a lot of cuddling of infected children, to prove there was nothing to fear, arranged adoptions for AIDS orphans, and nagged local orphanages to accept them, which was uphill work. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also in her bag were leaflets, printed at her own expense, about AIDS prevention. These were as unwanted as she was. Her phone was bugged, and she was followed. Even angrier now, she forged on. By 2003 she reckoned that 10m people in China had been infected with AIDS through blood-collection, 3m of them in Henan. It was a totally man-made catastrophe, the result of her own country\u2019s penchant for \u201clies, fraud and fakery\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The central government, which at least acknowledged AIDS elsewhere, was little help to her in Henan. Blood-stations were banned, but the trade went briskly on, every night, in the back streets of the capital, Zhengzhou. Still the central government doubted her word. In 2003 she told a deputy prime minister, Wu Yi, that if she didn\u2019t believe there was AIDS in the countryside she would rent a car herself, and take her there. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "By this time she was writing books about her work, but publishers in Henan were afraid to handle them. Although she was not allowed to speak to the press, she managed to tell her story to a reporter from the New York Times. In 2007 she even won an American award. But when she tried to go to Beijing to get a visa to travel abroad, Henan\u2019s officials put her under house arrest. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "After 20 days they relented, and she went briefly to America. Two years later, she moved there for good. She could not adjust: never learning English, and so rarely leaving her flat in West Harlem. But at least her books could be published there. She also gave searing testimony, through an interpreter, to a congressional committee. Now she could freely speak truth to power. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Having done that, she hoped to disappear. Her ashes would be scattered in the Yellow river and flow away eastwards, body and name together. She would vanish as completely as those unknown villagers of Henan, before she had discovered them. \u25a0"}], "id": 55}
