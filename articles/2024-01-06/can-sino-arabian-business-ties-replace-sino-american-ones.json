Last month they mingled openly in the lobby of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, at the \u201cFII Priority\u201d summit, an event organised by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), a $780bn vehicle for Saudi sovereign wealth. It was the first meeting of its kind in east Asia. It will not be the last. The PIF announced it was planning to set up an office in China. Mubadala and the Investment Corporation of Dubai, two Emirati sovereign wealth funds, the Qatar Investment Authority and Kuwait Investment Authority are all said to be preparing to deploy more capital in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. They think they can to do this without angering the increasingly China-wary West. \u201cWe are friendly people, we are friends with everyone,\u201d Jerry Todd, an executive at the PIF, told the conference in Hong Kong.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) by American firms in China fell below $9bn in 2023, down from $20bn five years earlier.
