On January 1st Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, and Muse Bihi Abdi, his counterpart in the would-be state of Somaliland next door, delivered a surprise announcement. At a press conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\u2019s capital, they revealed that landlocked Ethiopia is to lease a naval port and a 20km stretch of Red Sea coastline in the breakaway Somali state. In exchange, Somaliland is to receive shares in Ethiopian Airlines and\u2014much more significantly\u2014possibly official diplomatic recognition by the Ethiopian government. This would make Ethiopia the first country to formally recognise the former British colony, which declared independence from the rest of Somalia more than three decades ago."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240106_MAM964.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The deal has thrown an already volatile part of the world into even greater uncertainty. Authorities in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, have reacted furiously to the news that Ethiopia is willing to break with the African Union\u2019s long-standing policy against redrawing the continental map. \u201cAbiy is messing things up in Somalia,\u201d complains an adviser to Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Somalia\u2019s president. Just three days earlier Mr Mohamud and Mr Abdi had signed an agreement to resume talks over Somaliland\u2019s disputed constitutional status. That deal is now in tatters. Somalia declared the new agreement \u201cnull and void\u201d and recalled its ambassador from Addis Ababa. Mr Mohamud said the deal would serve only to fuel support for al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group that controls much of the countryside of Somalia and first emerged partly in response to Ethiopia\u2019s invasion of it in 2006. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Abiy, by contrast, portrayed the deal as a diplomatic triumph that fulfils Ethiopia\u2019s decades-long quest for direct access to the sea. In recent months the prime minister had alarmed observers with bellicose calls for Ethiopia\u2019s roughly 120m people to break out of what he has termed a \u201cgeographical prison\u201d. Though Ethiopia once had two ports as well as a navy, it lost these when Eritrea, a region to the north, seceded to form its own country in 1993. Since a bloody border war between 1998 and 2000, which deprived it of access to Eritrea\u2019s coastline, Ethiopia has relied on the port of Djibouti for almost all its external trade. In 2018 it struck a deal with Somaliland in which it was to acquire a 19% stake in the recently expanded port of Berbera, some 160km from Somaliland\u2019s capital, Hargeisa. Leaders in Mogadishu were furious; four years later the deal fell through. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Abiy has long made plain his ambition to make Ethiopia a power on the Red Sea and in the Bab el-Mandeb strait, one of the world\u2019s busiest and most geopolitically contested shipping lanes. A peace agreement with Eritrea was hailed at the time as an opportunity for Ethiopia to regain tax-free access to its neighbour\u2019s ports. The prime minister also mentioned an opaque deal with Somalia\u2019s former president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, for Ethiopia to use four unnamed ports along the coastline of Somalia, including Somaliland\u2019s."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Neither materialised. More recently foreign diplomats and analysts have fretted that Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, who is by turns messianic and unpredictable, plans to go to war with Eritrea in order to grab a slice of its coast. Now, though, Abiy can claim to have achieved his goals through diplomacy. \u201cIn accordance with the promise we repeatedly made to our people, [we have realised] the desire to access the Red Sea,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a desire to forcefully coerce anyone.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For Somaliland\u2019s leaders the deal marks a breakthrough in its three-decade-long quest for international recognition. \u201cSomalia has been using delaying tactics ever since talks began in 2012,\u201d says Mohamed Farah of the Academy for Peace and Development, a think-tank in Hargeisa. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for ever.\u201d Their hope is that where Ethiopia goes, the rest of Africa will follow: the African Union is based in Addis Ababa. Abiy also enjoys strong relations with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some foreign diplomats suspect the UAE, which is also close to Somalia\u2019s government, may have played a part in brokering the deal."}, {"role": "body", "text": " Its announcement came just as Abiy also played host to Sudan\u2019s most notorious warlord, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as Hemedti), whose paramilitary force, flush with Emirati cash and arms, is closing in on victory over the Sudanese army. In this view an Ethiopian military base in Somaliland is the latest step in an Emirati plan to secure a sphere of influence throughout the broader Gulf region and Horn of Africa."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Further turmoil is likely. Though Eritrea\u2019s rulers may breathe more easily now that Abiy appears to have achieved his goals without resorting to arms, the prospect, however distant, of an Ethiopian navy on their doorstep will hardly be welcome. Djibouti, which stands to lose out from competition for Ethiopia\u2019s trade flows, is also unhappy. The deal will probably also displease Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which are at odds with the UAE in its bid for regional dominance. To calm nerves, Somalia is appealing to the African Union and the UN Security Council to intervene. But as one Western diplomat notes, \u201cThis is an age where, if you\u2019re ruthless and reckless, nobody gets in your way.\u201d It is a lesson that Abiy has long taken to heart. \u25a0"}], "id": 26}
