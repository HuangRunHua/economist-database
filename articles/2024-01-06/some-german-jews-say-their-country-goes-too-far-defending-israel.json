All of them\u2014and many others, too\u2014have in the past three months found themselves abruptly cancelled in Germany. The reasons cited for pulling the plug on their shows, grants, contracts, awards or meetings with public officials have varied slightly. Yet all hang on a single fear: that these disinvited people, quite a few of whom happen to be Jewish, might have said something that someone might see as antisemitic. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "German ultra-squeamishness about antisemitism did not begin on October 7th, the day Hamas gunmen from Gaza launched a murderous rampage that left 1,200 Israelis dead. There is a context, beginning obviously with the Nazi regime\u2019s murder of 6m European Jews. One answer to that horror by subsequent generations of Germans has been to embrace the creation of Israel as a \u201chappy ending\u201d to their own national nightmare. Over time, says Eyal Weizmann, the British-Israeli leader of Forensic Architecture, a research group that has probed antisemitic attacks in Germany as well as Israeli human-rights violations, Germans have come to see any challenge to this redemption myth as something akin to committing a sin."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This evolution started decades ago, with Germany\u2019s decision to offer war reparations not just to Holocaust survivors but also to the new Jewish state. In the late 1960s the darker chapters in German history began to be explored with sharper objectivity. This long process of coping with the past grew to underpin a new, self-effacing German national identity. Angela Merkel, the chancellor from 2005 to 2021, cemented the sense of a special responsibility to Israel by stressing that its security is a part of Germany\u2019s own \u201creason of state\u201d. In 2019, ironically at the instigation of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party widely shunned as fascistic, German legislators adopted a motion that equated calls to boycott Israel with antisemitism. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This official conflation, identifying opposition to Israeli policy with hostility to Jews in general, spread more widely with the appointment of government \u201cantisemitism commissioners\u201d. Organisations that rely on state funding, which in Germany means a very large proportion, have found themselves increasingly scrutinised over suspicions that they might cross this bureaucracy\u2019s vaguely defined lines. The fear of budget cuts or public ostracism\u2014the underlying cause of the rash of cancellations cited above\u2014is not misplaced, as Oyoun, a cultural centre in Berlin, discovered in November. The city abruptly severed funding for the venue after it hosted a pro-peace Jewish NGO that one culture commissioner thought might encourage \u201chidden forms\u201d of antisemitism."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The horror of Gaza, where Israeli forces have now killed more than 18 times as many people as Hamas\u2019s terrorists killed on October 7th, has exposed the awkwardness of Germany\u2019s one-sided embrace of Israel, but also placed Germany\u2019s Jews in a quandary. Some fear that official over-protectiveness could itself provoke an anti-Jewish backlash. By contrast Wieland Hoban, a Frankfurt-based composer and Jewish activist, suggests that being told by the German establishment \u201chow to be Jews\u201d could itself be called antisemitic. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But perhaps the advice delivered at a Berlin seminar in December by Alon-Lee Green, an Israeli activist, is easier for Germans to understand. If you really want to act as a good friend to Israel, he said, criticism is fine. When a friend is drunk you don\u2019t give them another drink. You take them home and put them to bed. \u25a0"}], "id": 31}
