It does produce the world\u2019s third-highest number of journal articles in science and engineering, up from 3.7% of the total in 2012 to 6.2% a decade later (see chart 1).

The chief instrument to boost that power is the National Research Foundation (NRF), which was created by an act of Parliament last year.

But they can be sorted into four broad buckets. The first is money. India\u2019s overall spending on R&D is low by global standards, but the government is, surprisingly, blameless. Among other major science powers, the state rarely funds more than a quarter of a country\u2019s overall R&D spending, with the rest made up by industry and philanthropy. In India the government accounts for nearly two-thirds. Measured in terms of purchasing power, its dollar contribution is more than twice as high as the British government\u2019s. It is the private sector that is not pulling its weight."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The low participation by private companies can be partly explained by the way government money is distributed. Nearly two-thirds of India\u2019s R&D spending is devoted to defence, the space programme and atomic energy, areas in which the state has not traditionally collaborated with industry. Government bodies and agencies perform more than half of R&D in India, compared with 16% in China and under 10% in most other advanced economies. What money remains for academic research institutions is spread too thinly across far too many projects. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second bucket is institutions. India has about 40,000 of them focused on higher education, but less than 1% engage in research. This small cadre of elite institutions produces much of India\u2019s scientific output, while the majority of universities busy themselves with teaching. Few places do both well. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Moreover, most top-class institutions focus on specific disciplines, with few opportunities for collaboration across areas of science, let alone with the humanities. Nor do they work much with each other. The result is a science establishment that is less than the sum of its parts. There is an urgent need to address both \u201cunnecessary duplication\u201d and \u201cthe gaps which are in our R&D system\u201d, admits Ajay Sood, a physicist who now serves as the principal scientific adviser to the government of India, a position created in 1999."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The third major problem for Indian science is talent. At first blush this seems counter-intuitive. Researchers at the country\u2019s top state institutions uniformly express satisfaction with their salaries, and India is teeming with people. At 31%, a larger proportion of its graduates studied STEM subjects than in America (20%) or even Israel (27%). But many students graduate with a poor education because of inadequate facilities, mediocre teaching and outdated curriculums, and many of the most talented go abroad. India loses people to overseas institutions at every stage: masters, PhD and post-doc. Once they have gone, it is difficult to get them back."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last year India became the largest source of overseas graduate students in America, ahead of China. Including undergraduates, Indians now make up a quarter of all foreign university students in America. Of the roughly 2.5m immigrant STEM workers in that country, 29% are Indian. In ai, India is the source of 8% of the world\u2019s top researchers; the proportion who work in India itself rounds to zero."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The NRF is designed to solve each of these problems. Officials say they would like to see India\u2019s research-spending-to-GDP ratio more than double, to between 1.5% and 1.8%, with most of the new cash coming from industry. Research institutions will be incentivised to submit proposals for grants jointly with businesses that have committed their own funding. Of the NRF\u2019s 500bn-rupee expenditure, only 140bn rupees, or 28%, will come from the state. For its part, the government says it will fund more high-risk projects."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A second strand of the NRF is connecting research institutions with each other and with universities. One way to do this is to set up \u201ccentres of excellence\u201d, for example in quantum computing and communication at smaller universities, and then lure scientists from elite institutions with the promise of autonomy, equipment and a mandate to recruit the best researchers from anywhere in the world."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To make that last bit possible, the government plans to raise funding for post-docs and to set up endowed professorships. At current salary levels, someone working in America \u201cis getting ten times more money. So why should he come back? Or why should someone in India not go?\u201d asks Akhilesh Gupta who, as a senior adviser in the department of science and technology, is a key figure in the implementation of the nRF. Good facilities and good professors should, the hope is, attract good students, helping to stanch the flow of talent to the West. Moreover, the National Education Policy of 2020 seeks to restructure higher education to produce better qualified undergraduates, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The brain research centre in Bangalore, which predates NRF by several years, is an example of how elements of this plan could work in practice. It was set up as a public-private partnership with IISc in 2014 thanks to the gift of a huge sum, by Indian standards, of 2.25bn rupees ($27m) over ten years by Mr Gopalakrishnan\u2019s philanthropic organisation, Pratiksha Trust. Last year the foundation topped up funding with another 4.5bn rupees. The CBR has world-class facilities, scientists who are well paid, and a long-term mandate. Its shiny new building contrasts with the dated early- and mid-20th-century edifices elsewhere on the IISc campus, whose interiors seem stuck in time. Yet the ranks of Indian philanthropists giving money to domestic research institutions can be counted on the fingers of two hands."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Riding on a silver dream"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Attracting researchers back to India will in part depend on the success of such partnerships. But they have to contend with a fourth constraint on Indian science: bureaucracy. The current system can be stifling for those with experience of academic life abroad. Consider the case of Yamuna Krishnan, a chemist. Queuing for coffee one day in 2005 at the University of Cambridge, where she was a post-doc, she overheard a fellow caffeine-seeker complain to his mate that \u201call science from China and India is copy-cattery\u201d. \u201cI was seething by the time I reached the front of the queue,\u201d says Dr Krishnan.
