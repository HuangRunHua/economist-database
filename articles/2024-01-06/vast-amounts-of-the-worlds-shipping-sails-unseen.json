Most public mapping is done through the automatic identification system (AIS), which relies on ships to broadcast their location, identity and activities to those onshore. But coverage is patchy. The European Union requires AIS broadcasts from all ships longer than 15m, while Americans spare those shorter than 19m. China, Japan and South Korea have no specific AIS regulations. Large areas of the world, including much of the Pacific and South Atlantic, have poor AIS reception."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of the missing tonnage has its origins in Asia, where the number of untracked vessels exceeds those from all other continents combined.

The researchers used satellite data that provided continuous high-resolution images of the busiest 15% of the world\u2019s oceans from 2017 to 2021, and cross-checked this vast dataset with 53bn historical ship locations available through AIS. They then trained neural networks to recognise ships, based on their characteristic glare of reflected light, and used data such as distance from port, daily speed and nearby signs of marine life to classify their activity. While noting that most vessels shorter than 15m probably escaped their view, they estimated a false positive rate of less than 2% for those they did identify."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240106_STM905.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 730.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though legitimate reasons exist for sailing incognito, the researchers point to a number of suspicious sites of activity (see map).

Meanwhile the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, off the eastern coast of Australia, was visited by an average of three fishing vessels a day, suggesting possible unobserved environmental damage."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The researchers were also able to monitor the growth in stationary ocean-based infrastructure, an area where no comprehensive data is publicly available.
