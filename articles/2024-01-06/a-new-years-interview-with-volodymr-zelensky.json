Russia is still striking at Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Odessa and elsewhere, but the world is no longer listening as intently and the master-communicator no longer controls the narrative as he did two years ago. In Ukraine, weariness is setting in. In the West headlines ask whether Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, has started to win.

Maybe not everything is as fast as someone imagined,\u201d he says, but the idea that Mr Putin is winning is no more than a \u201cfeeling\u201d. The reality, he says, is that Russian forces are still being slaughtered in places like Avdiivka, from where he has just returned.

Fatalism can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is what makes the coming year so vital.
