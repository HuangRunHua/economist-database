The reviews were stellar. Yet unlike the previous season of the science-fiction show, which clocked nearly 1bn hours of viewing in its first month, the most recent instalment has so far been seen by only a few thousand people. That is because Netflix\u2019s new show is not being streamed down fibre-optic cables to television screens, but performed live on a stage in London\u2019s West End."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d (pictured), the streamer\u2019s first stab at theatre, is playing at the Phoenix, with hopes of an international run. It is not the only example of Tinseltown invading theatreland. A few streets away at the Theatre Royal, Disney offers a live version of \u201cFrozen\u201d, while nearby at the Adelphi there is a musical tribute to \u201cBack to the Future\u201d. In 2025 a live production of \u201cPaddington\u201d will join the London line-up. Meanwhile on Broadway, Amazon is getting ready to launch a musical of \u201cTransparent\u201d, a drama that first ran on its Prime Video service."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hollywood\u2019s turn on the stage is part of a broader shift by the movie business towards live experiences. As attendance at the cinema declines, studios are finding new ways to excite\u2014and monetise\u2014their fans outside their homes. From restaurants and art exhibitions to escape rooms and assault courses, film-makers are concocting novel ways to soak up demand. \u201cThere\u2019s this insatiable appetite from those mega-fans,\u201d says Marian Lee, Netflix\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cThey want more. They\u2019ll eat up anything you serve them.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is a new take on an old playbook. In the 1950s Walt Disney drew a diagram of the mutually reinforcing pillars of his business: movies promoted television spin-offs, which fed demand for theme parks, which sold merchandise, which promoted movies, and so on. Other studios such as Universal copied the blueprint, creating parks and toys from the characters made popular by films."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today these ventures are more than sidelines. The entertainment industry\u2019s turbulent digital transition has left Hollywood more reliant than ever on rollercoasters and plastic lightsabres. In the last financial year Disney\u2019s \u201cexperiences\u201d division, which includes five theme parks and a fleet of cruise ships, contributed $9bn in operating profit, as its streaming business lost $2.5bn. At the same time the creative engine at the centre of Walt Disney\u2019s diagram\u2014the cinema\u2014is sputtering. Worldwide box-office takings for 2023 will be 20% below their pre-pandemic level; even before covid the average American was going to the movies three and a half times a year, down from five in 2000. As the silver screen fades, studios are losing their most powerful way of exciting audiences. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "So they are turning to new tactics. Some are doubling down on their parks. Warner Bros, a relative latecomer to the business, opened the world\u2019s largest indoor theme park in Abu Dhabi in 2018. Disney announced in September that it would double its investment in its parks and cruises over the next decade, promising \u201cFrozen\u201d lands among other attractions. Universal is building a resort in Texas and in December said it had bought land for a possible park in Britain."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Studios are also devising new kinds of entertainment. Warner opened \u201cVisions of Magic\u201d, a Harry Potter \u201cinteractive art experience\u201d, in Cologne in December and plans a similar show based on its DC Comics series in late 2024. Universal promises an interactive \u201chorror experience\u201d in Las Vegas, based on its catalogue of scary movies, beginning with \u201cFrankenstein\u201d (1931)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Moviemakers are experimenting with food and drink, too. Warner\u2019s eateries range from Park Row, a Batman-themed restaurant in London with a ten-course tasting menu priced at \u00a3195 ($246), to Central Perk, a \u201cFriends\u201d caf\u00e9 that opened in Boston in November, serving coffee and Joey\u2019s meatball sandwiches."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to take the pulse of what folks are interested in,\u201d says Peter Van Roden of Warner\u2019s themed-entertainment division, who monitors merchandise sales, online clicks and box-office receipts to see which titles are good candidates for turning into such experiences. Social media, which encourage sharing and \u201cFOMO\u201d (fear of missing out), have made it easier for short-term \u201cpop-up\u201d experiences to succeed, he adds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Netflix, the studio that is most sceptical of the cinema, has been among the most innovative at devising alternatives. Before it began organising live events, devotees of popular shows would come to premieres in home-made costumes, says Ms Lee. \u201cWe had all these breadcrumbs that were indicating to us that fans wanted a deeper way to get together\u2026and then have something in-person to engage with,\u201d she says. Netflix tested various formats, starting with a \u201cStranger Things\u201d drive-through show during the pandemic, and has since held events including \u201cMoney Heist\u201d escape rooms and \u201cBridgerton\u201d balls."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The latest is a \u201cSquid Game\u201d experience in Los Angeles, where participants play six games based on the show, bossed around by suitably strict guards (there is no prize money, but no risk of execution either). The Economist\u2019s contestant came second, in part because he consumed fewer pre-game Korean cocktails from the adjoining bar than some of his rivals."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unlike Disney, whose parks are priced with an eye on the bottom line, Netflix sees its events as ads for its shows. The brief is: \u201cWhat can you give [fans] in between seasons, to really further that excitement that they have around these characters?\u201d says Ms Lee. Prices reflect this: the cost of the 70-minute live \u201cSquid Game\u201d experience starts at $39, while tickets for the \u201cStranger Things\u201d play are available from \u00a320, cheap by West End standards. (Green-and-white tracksuits and cuddly demogorgons cost extra.) The streaming company does not report revenues for its events or merchandise, but on a recent earnings call described them as \u201csmall things\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Can the new in-person experiences make audiences fall in love with characters and stories as the cinema long has? Mr Van Roden, who declares himself a cinema fan, rejects the idea that they are substitutes. But their essential, shared characteristic is that they are communal. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not consciously connecting with the people in the room with you, it\u2019s this common, human sort of electric connection, that you\u2019re sharing it together,\u201d he says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the \u201cSquid Game\u201d assault course, the cocktail-fuelled contestants have been having such a riotous time together that Netflix has considered adding more soundproofing to the set. The growing number of live attractions from Hollywood means that audiences have more reasons than ever to get off the sofa and have fun with other people\u2014even if the ultimate aim is to persuade them to spend yet more time in front of the television. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 51}
