Few keep them", "hashTag": "Culture", "authorName": "The Economist", "publishDate": "2023-12-30T11:22:01Z", "contents": [{"role": "body", "text": "\u201cEvery man hath two birth-days,\u201d proclaimed Charles Lamb, a Romantic essayist, in 1821: his personal one and New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cIt is that from which all date their time,\u201d Lamb wrote, \u201cand count upon what is left.\u201d The turn of the year was an occasion to \u201cencounter pell-mell with past disappointments\u201d. But it was also a prompt to look ahead to the years that remained to him, which seemed to pass ever more quickly."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This one-two of retrospection and encroaching mortality often leads to self-reproach\u2014for hours wasted, love undeclared and careless cruelties\u2014and thence to vows for the future. Lamb\u2019s was to squeeze life dry (and have another cup of wine). Collectively, he and other writers and storytellers offer a handy typography of new year\u2019s resolutions, virtuous and violent, kept and otherwise."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Booze is a central theme, either as the subject of the resolution or the spur for it. At the close of 1661, for instance, Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary that he had sworn a \u201csolemn oath\u201d to abstain from wine. He did for a few weeks, finding he spent less money and frittered away less time \u201cin idle company\u201d. But he couldn\u2019t keep it up and by February was hitting the bottle again. Likewise the heroine of \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary\u201d resolves to drink less and \u201cstop talking total nonsense to strangers\u201d. She struggles on both counts."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In her case and others, drinking lubricates another type of resolution, namely an intent to find love. Like Christmas, only with more ambient smooching, New Year\u2019s Eve is a lonely time for singletons. At one new year\u2019s bash, the titular characters in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d (pictured) resolve to be each other\u2019s dates if they are still unattached a year later. When the day comes, Sally is marooned at a party stuffed with big Eighties hair and ruched dresses. Harry bursts in just before \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d, resolved to speak his heart. \u201cIt\u2019s not because it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d he insists. But it kinda is."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Occasionally the resolution is not to get into a relationship but out of one. At the start of Ibsen\u2019s play \u201cA Doll\u2019s House\u201d, Nora is looking forward to a new year free of financial worries. Before it dawns, she is instead free of her dreadful husband."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At least on screen and page, amatory resolutions seem easier to fulfil than the alcoholic kind. Then there are those that involve a full-on moral reformation. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to become a mensch,\u201d says the protagonist of Billy Wilder\u2019s sleazy-screwball comedy \u201cThe Apartment\u201d. Having resolved to mend his ways\u2014he has been lending his flat to his bosses to use for adulterous trysts\u2014he duly gets the girl on New Year\u2019s Eve. They consecrate their union with a game of gin rummy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is the night when some characters muster the gumption to reverse their fortunes. In \u201cTrading Places\u201d, the good guys ruin the baddies in a heist featuring a gorilla and a fancy-dress party on a train. Or it can inspire epiphanies: in \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d, during new-year festivities in Cuba, Michael Corleone realises his brother Fredo has betrayed him. In a twisted parody of a midnight embrace, Michael kisses Fredo and grasps his neck in a form of reverse throttle. \u201cI know it was you, Fredo,\u201d he growls. In that fierce clinch, he resolves to be avenged and Fredo\u2019s fate is sealed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even when they don\u2019t involve fratricide, new year\u2019s resolutions can be ill-advised. It may be a natural time to assess your life, but it is also a febrile, maudlin and frequently inebriated one. The results can be foolish and unrealistic\u2014whether they are can-do, mind-over-matter aspirations to do more, or plans to go easy on yourself and do less. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This last type of new year\u2019s resolution has a logical flaw. If you are the sort of disciplined person who makes them in earnest, a promise to put your feet up may be hard to honour. Take Virginia Woolf. In 1931, she wrote in her diary, her first resolution was \u201cTo have none.\u201d Next, she intended to be \u201ckindly with myself\u201d. Immediately afterwards, however, she pledges \u201cTo make a good job of \u2018The Waves\u2019,\u201d an experimental novel published later that year. Woolf took it easy for two whole lines."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sceptics might think Lamb made too much of January 1st. After all, the hinge between two calendar years is a fleeting and arbitrary punctuation in time, no more meaningful than any other moment. Then again, in the context of eternity, your entire life is a fleeting, arbitrary punctuation in time. This is as good an opportunity as any to glance back, peer forward and make improving resolutions. \u201cNext week\u201d, quipped Mark Twain at the start of 1863, \u201cyou can begin paving hell with them as usual.\u201d\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:Holding out for a hero in 2024 (Dec 20th)Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d cuts the emperor down to size (Nov 15th)\u201cKing Lear\u201d and the purpose of tragedy in dark times (Nov 1st)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Back Story column got its name."}], "id": 53}
