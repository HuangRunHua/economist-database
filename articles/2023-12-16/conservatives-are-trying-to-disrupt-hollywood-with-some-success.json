This is the pitch of \u201cThe Shift\u201d, a sci-fi film that was released on December 1st. But it could also describe its distributor, Angel Studios, run by brothers who call themselves simple \u201cfarm boys from Idaho\u201d and are on a crusade to remake Hollywood."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Angel, an independent studio, is at the forefront of an important trend in American entertainment. Conservatives, who decry Hollywood for becoming not a dream factory but a \u201cwokeness\u201d factory, are writing and producing their own films and series, catering to viewers who do not share the left\u2019s views on gender, race and political correctness. Call them \u201cconservative Hollywood\u201d, or the \u201calt-write\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Their biggest hit is \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d, an action thriller from Angel, which will begin streaming on Amazon Prime Video on December 26th. It raked in $184m in ticket sales in American cinemas, outgrossing the latest instalments in the \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchises. (It also outperformed abroad, where it grossed $63m.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cSound of Freedom\u201d is \u201cDirty Harry\u201d for the Donald Trump era. The plot appeals to Republican viewers: an American lawman sees evil, tries to defeat it and comes up against a heartless government bureaucracy, so he takes the law into his own hands and saves the day. The film fictionalises the life of Tim Ballard, a controversial campaigner against sex trafficking. In the film, he is portrayed as a righteous federal agent, who catches paedophiles sharing child pornography online. Bent on saving more children, Mr Ballard is told by his supervisor he cannot go on a dangerous rescue mission to South America. He hands in his badge and sets off anyway. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Among the film\u2019s fans is Mr Trump, who has said, \u201cThis is a very important film and very important movie, and it\u2019s a very important documentary all wrapped up in one.\u201d Ahead of the election in 2024, Mr Trump wants to show support for combating sex trafficking, which many evangelical voters care about and some conspiracy theorists exaggerate in ridiculous ways. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other firms heard the fireworks of \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d and showed up for the party, including the Daily Wire, a media outlet founded by Ben Shapiro, a conservative pundit, and Jeremy Boreing, a film-maker. (\u201cIt\u2019s time to blow up the Death Star that is the left-wing monopoly on entertainment,\u201d Mr Shapiro has proclaimed.) The Daily Wire\u2019s films and series come out on DailyWire+, its streaming platform, which claims 1m subscribers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The latest is \u201cLady Ballers\u201d, a comedy directed by Mr Boreing. It follows lousy male basketball players who become transgender to compete in a women\u2019s league and enthusiastically lampoons the liberal orthodoxy around gender identity. Unsurprisingly, it has not scored well with liberal viewers. One progressive commentator dubbed it \u201c\u2018Mrs Doubtfire\u2019, but evil\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cLady Ballers\u201d might not sound like a Hollywood film, but it looks like one. Slicker production has increased the appeal of conservative studios\u2019 offerings, and streaming has helped them reach more viewers. This represents a dramatic shift. For decades, conservatives\u2019 attempts to compete with mainstream Hollywood films were dismal. \u201cLeft Behind\u201d, an apocalyptic film trilogy from 2000-05 reimagining the Book of Revelation, is a good example: an aspiring thriller franchise, instead the films resemble amateur, rejected submissions from film-school applicants. (They were released straight to video.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today\u2019s \u201calt-write\u201d offerings fall into three categories. The first, most predictably, involves woke-bashing. \u201cLady Ballers\u201d is the prototype: it takes a hot-button issue and satirises it. The result boosts Republican politicians\u2019 talking points. (\u201cLady Ballers\u201d features a cameo from Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas.) Daily Wire recently announced a new adult animated comedy series, \u201cMr Birchum\u201d, about a teacher who \u201cattempts to navigate a world he doesn\u2019t understand or approve of\u201d. The voice cast includes Roseanne Barr, a Trump-supporting comedian, and Megyn Kelly, a former Fox News anchor."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second category is religious, or \u201cfaith-based\u201d, content. Neal Harmon, the boss of Angel, says his studio wants to tell stories that \u201camplify light\u201d. For example, \u201cThe Shift\u201d, Angel\u2019s newest film, is inspired by the biblical story of Job. One of its biggest successes is \u201cThe Chosen\u201d, a series based on Jesus\u2019s life, which has been streamed more than 500m times. The firm is currently fundraising for an animated movie about David. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Counterintuitively, the third category of content eschews politics altogether. Take, for example, Amanda Milius, a former State Department official under Mr Trump, who shot to fame with a documentary on the Trump-Russia dossier. Among her current array of projects is a biopic of John McAfee, a larger-than-life computer programmer. \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of hookers and cocaine on a yacht. I can\u2019t really pitch that to conservative America,\u201d she quips. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Milius is adamant art must trump partisanship: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be on the right and you\u2019re going to say, \u2018Oh, Hollywood is overtaken by the left,\u2019 don\u2019t make the same mistakes, and don\u2019t lead with your ideology\u2026lead with the story and lead with the aesthetics,\u201d she says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Others are doing the same. Daily Wire\u2019s non-political films include a Western, \u201cTerror on the Prairie\u201d; a thriller, \u201cShut In\u201d; and a quirky comedy, \u201cThe Hyperions\u201d. In October the studio launched Bentkey, a platform for kids, with the mission of depoliticising children\u2019s entertainment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But even in \u201cdepoliticised\u201d films, politics are palpable. Bentkey launched amid a row over Disney\u2019s remake of the cartoon \u201cSnow White\u201d from 1937. The lead actress, Rachel Zegler, has promised a modern take: \u201cIt\u2019s no longer 1937,\u201d so Snow White is \u201cnot going to be saved by the prince, and she\u2019s not going to be dreaming about true love\u201d. In response, Bentkey is making a version of \u201cSnow White\u201d, which claims to be a more faithful remake and \u201ca tale of timeless truth\u201d. (It comes out next year.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Boreing is clear-eyed about the wider market for Daily Wire productions, even ostensibly non-political ones. \u201cI think the idea that you can make \u2018mainstream content\u2019 and draw people left and right to view right now is a bit naive,\u201d he admits. America has split into two tribes\u2014liberal and conservative\u2014who consume different products, different news sources and, increasingly, different entertainment. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Does that mean that conservative films will be relegated to audiences of true believers? The broad success of \u201cThe Chosen\u201d suggests not. Streaming, whether through studios\u2019 own platforms or through popular ones like Netflix, will give films and tv series a wide reach in America. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And there is a potential for reaching global audiences, too. Once again, \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d is a harbinger. The film performed well in South America, where it tapped into a network of conservative movers and shakers. In Brazil, the sons of Jair Bolsonaro, the former president and an ally of Mr Trump, went to the premiere. In El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, the president, encouraged Salvadoreans to see the film."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Europe could also become an important market for American conservative content. Across the continent politicians on the right are ascendant, and battles from America\u2019s culture wars have spread there, too. In France, le wokisme is a major topic of discussion. Only last month, Europe 1, a leading radio station, ran an editorial slamming Disney for embracing the \u201cwoke revolution\u201d, which it hotly described as \u201ca deconstruction of our childhood dreams\u201d. It sounded a lot like Mr Boreing\u2019s sales pitch for Bentkey. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 67}
