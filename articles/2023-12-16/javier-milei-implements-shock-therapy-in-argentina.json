Fans raised chainsaws into the air, in reference to his promise to cut down the size of the state."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The inaugural address set the tone for the shock therapy to follow. On December 12th Luis Caputo, the new economy minister, unveiled a series of radical economic reforms. He announced a devaluation of the peso by over 50% (see chart), and promised to slash electricity and transport subsidies, halve the number of government ministries from 18 to nine, suspend public works and reduce federal transfers to Argentina\u2019s 23 provinces. The government reckons these cuts amount to almost 3% of GDP.

Child benefits will double, as will the value of a government food card for the country\u2019s poorest. The idea is to cut spending while temporarily increasing taxes to raise revenue, in order to lower the annual deficit from over 5% of GDP today to zero by the end of 2024. \u201cWe have come to solve the addiction to fiscal deficits,\u201d said Mr Caputo, noting that Argentina has been in the red for 113 of the past 123 years. The IMF, which is owed $43bn by Argentina, applauded the \u201cbold initial actions\u201d and promised to work \u201cexpeditiously\u201d with the new government in the coming months.

The new president rose to fame promising to dollarise the economy and shut down the central bank. Yet since being elected in mid-November, he has put plans for dollarisation on hold and sidelined loyalists. Instead, he has stuffed his cabinet with technocrats from the main centre-right coalition, Together for Change, which held the presidency from 2015 to 2019.

Given that a cheaper peso, new taxes and fewer subsidies will make living more expensive, there is a chance that prices could rise even higher. Mart\u00edn Rapetti, a consultant, believes monthly inflation will at least double to around 20% and remain high for several months. But that is far from certain. Mr Milei\u2019s emphasis on fiscal discipline may reassure markets that Argentina is not headed for disaster\u2014if they choose to believe him. That would quickly pull inflation down, rather than push it up. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The confidence of the market \u201cwill depend on the degree of social conflict\u201d, says Mr Rapetti. Since Argentina\u2019s return to democracy in 1983, all but one non-Peronist president has been booted out of office by protests against economic reforms. Social organisations were quick to respond to Mr Caputo\u2019s announcement. Demonstrations have been called for December 20th.

Yet taxes will now increase significantly, at least temporarily, and austerity will affect far more than just public workers. His coalition has only 10% of seats in the Senate, and 15% in the lower house.
