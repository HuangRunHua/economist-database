Over the past half-century, the proportion of R&amp;D funded by governments has fallen sharply relative to private-sector funding. Corporations struggle to capture the full value of investments in early-stage research and tend to focus on short-term wins. At the same time governments, which economic theory tells us should be filling the gap in early-stage research, have shifted their focus towards later technology readiness."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The trend is accelerating. According to data from the American Defence Department, recent spending in early phases of R&amp;D was a quarter of the total at the turn of the century. In the budget request for fiscal year 2024 it dropped to 13%. Australia\u2019s defence agency recently considered its own version of America\u2019s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. It changed course, opting instead for a \u201ccapabilities accelerator\u201d charged primarily with speeding adoption of dual-use and other later-stage technologies.

How about a more entrepreneurial approach that cuts the bureaucracy and red tape? If the British government treated the multitude of small charities supporting nascent cancer-research projects as early \u201cangel\u201d investors it could join in with larger later-stage funding for the most promising research. Small charities like Pancreatic Cancer UK have an important role in seeding new, risky and ambitious research for pressing challenges in treating the less survivable cancers: brain, pancreatic, liver, stomach, oesophageal and lung. They seek outcomes, not profit."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Promising projects funded by PCUK, like an exciting new low-cost breath test being developed by a team at Imperial College, can dramatically improve outcomes through early detection.

Prediction markets use betting to aggregate expertise and incentivise participants to get it right.

First, economists generally agree that a country\u2019s progress is positively linked to robust institutions.
