In both countries, audiences are lapping it up and bureaucrats want to ban it. \u201cSlovo Patsana\u201d, or \u201cA Fella\u2019s Word\u201d, is set in the criminal underworld of perestroika-era Tatarstan. By the late 1980s, the Russian republic\u2019s street gangs were infamous. Young kids \u201cdivided up the tarmac\u201d of Kazan, the regional capital, under the eyes of older criminals. Those who joined the gangs were called patsany, and had protection of sorts. Those who did not, the chushpany, were targets of often extreme violence.

Its high production values and unflinching drama made it a hit almost as soon as it aired in November. In Russia its title was the single most-searched term on search engines; in Ukraine it was not far behind. The title music, which goes unidentified in the credits because the musicians are anti-war, tops charts in both countries.
