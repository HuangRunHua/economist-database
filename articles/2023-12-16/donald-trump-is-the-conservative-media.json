But a security guard refused him entry into the champagne-drenched celebration because he lacked press credentials. \u201cI am media,\u201d the Grammy winner reportedly responded. Three years later, Donald Trump successfully crashed a much bigger party: the Republican National Convention. Mr Trump, a walking media institution, brushed aside early opposition from right-leaning news and opinion outlets and won the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. In the years since, conservative media either have conformed to his vision of politics or tried and failed to persuade Republican voters to abandon it. This dynamic has accelerated as he pursues his party\u2019s nomination for a third time."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For much of American history, the dominant media institutions were partisan or ideological. George Washington even complained of being \u201cbuffitted in the public prints by a set of infamous scribblers\u201d. But the media oligopolies that dominated much of the 20th century\u2014big television and radio networks and print publications with enormous circulations\u2014claimed to bring Americans balanced, non-partisan, objective reporting. American conservatives were highly sceptical of the arrangement."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThere was no conservative media. It was basically a wasteland. And anything that even remotely expressed any kind of conservative point of view was sort of relegated to a smattering of columnists,\u201d says Laurence Jurdem, a historian at Fairfield University and Fordham College and author of a book on conservative media before Ronald Reagan. \u201cEverything sort of changed with National Review.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Founded in 1955 by William F. Buckley junior, the magazine promoted a political philosophy that came to be known as fusionism. The new conservative coalition would fuse together economic libertarians, social traditionalists and anti-communists. Buckley also served as a gatekeeper at times, denouncing the leader of the conspiratorial John Birch Society in editorials. Other conservative publications\u2014Commentary magazine, the Wall Street Journal editorial page, the Washington Times, Human Events, and more\u2014influenced the presidency of Reagan. Conservative media continued to grow after Reagan left the White House, and the fusionist consensus largely held together at the end of the cold war, at least at first. That was owing in great part to three men who found a way to do what Buckley and other intellectuals never could: run highly profitable media businesses."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Together, Rush Limbaugh, Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch challenged the old guard\u2019s dominance by developing viable conservative alternatives in every medium. Limbaugh, a charismatic radio veteran, took his show national in 1988 and drew a weekly audience of some 20m listeners by the 1990s. He also published books and would sometimes appear on Fox News. Mr Murdoch controls the network that Ailes led from its founding in 1996 until he resigned in 2016."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The media magnate found ways to make the written word profitable through his acquisition of the Journal and several publishing houses. But Fox News was special. It overtook cnn in ratings in 2002, and in 2022 it marked 20 consecutive years with more daytime and prime-time viewers than any other network. Perhaps because of its dominance, it is easy to overlook that it serves a niche: 74m Americans voted for Mr Trump in 2020. Fox News\u2019s prime-time audience is below 2m (its digital reach is wider)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Limbaugh, Ailes and Mr Murdoch could have disagreements but shared fundamental conservative instincts. For decades Fox News and Limbaugh, alongside publications like National Review, kept Republican Party politicians in line with free markets, hawkish internationalism and fiscal and social conservatism. They did not always succeed in swaying powerful Republicans. Yet a dissenting or unsavoury figure had little way to get his message to a large audience of conservatives if he was banished from Fox News, talk radio or the pages of a few print publications."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then came the internet. Blogs, podcasts and social media provided a way for a conservative journalist or pundit to become influential outside the established ecosystem. Mr Trump relied on conservative media to reach Republican voters in the 2016 primary, as all candidates did, but he alone could reset the newscycle with a tweet."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In early 2016, as Mr Trump\u2019s winning the nomination appeared increasingly likely, National Review devoted an issue to opposing his candidacy. The cover simply read: \u201cAgainst Trump\u201d, and the magazine\u2019s editors commissioned a range of conservative intellectuals to make the case. Mr Trump, naturally, responded with a tweetstorm about \u201cthe dying National Review\u201d. Six months later he became the Republican nominee. Fusionism had been challenged by a conservatism that wanted to cut taxes, maintain entitlement programmes for the elderly, was preoccupied by illegal immigration, fairly relaxed about gay marriage\u2014and had built a cult around the leader. Call it confusionism."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Gone are the gatekeepers"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cHe\u2019ll be influenced occasionally by things people say, or ideas that are out there, but it\u2019s Trump who lays down the line.

Mr Trump called Fox News a \u201chostile network\u201d in June after tough questioning from its chief political anchor, but conservative prime-time hosts like Sean Hannity still throw softballs to the former president.
