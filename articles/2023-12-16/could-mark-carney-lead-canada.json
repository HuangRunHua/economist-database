A recent poll by Ipsos suggested that fully 72% of Canadians feel that Mr Trudeau should step down as the leader of the Liberal Party before the vote. Mr Carney is among a handful of potential candidates to replace him, including Chrystia Freeland, the current finance minister, and M\u00e9lanie Joly, the minister of foreign affairs. Ms Freeland leads the polls as Mr Trudeau\u2019s replacement, with 25% of those asked saying they have a positive opinion of her, compared with 18% for Ms Joly and 16% for Mr Carney (most answer that they \u201cdo not know\u201d)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Carney has not yet explicitly stated his intention to throw his hat in the ring.

Those advising Mr Carney say that if Mr Trudeau offers him a parliamentary seat close to his home in Ottawa, as well as a meaningful role in cabinet, he will make the leap from the private sector. They also believe that he would make a bid for party leadership, should Mr Trudeau step down before the election. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But does the former bank boss have what it takes? Mr Carney is in many ways a textbook instance of the metropolitan liberal elite. He was educated at Harvard and Oxford, then worked for Goldman Sachs, a bank. In 2004 he moved to Canada\u2019s finance department, to work for Stephen Harper, the Conservative prime minister. In 2008 he became governor of the Bank of Canada just after the global financial crisis struck. Mr Carney was the public face of a decision to cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points one month into his appointment. Canada came out of the recession faster than other G7 economies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2013 he became the first non-Briton to head the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694.

He ended that role in 2020, and now spends half of his time working pro bono as the UN special envoy for climate action and finance. The other half is spent as chairman of Bloomberg LP, a media company, and as head of impact investing at Brookfield Asset Management, a fund.

We should be again.\u201d He wants Canada to be \u201can energy superpower\u201d, along with building up AI prowess and building houses \u201cat a totally different scale\u201d. He is a \u201cbig believer\u201d in the power of public policy going hand-in-hand with free markets.
