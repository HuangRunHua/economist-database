The president\u2019s speech reflected on the state of race relations and God\u2019s grace, suggesting that, amid the horror and the anger, forgiveness might one day be possible. As he finished, Mr Obama began to sing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d. The congregation, many of them weeping, joined in. No one needed a hymn book."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If you were to put together a soundtrack of America, \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d would be on it. Singers including Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Elvis Presley and Diana Ross have recorded their own interpretations. It was performed at the funeral of Ronald Reagan and the inauguration of Bill Clinton. By one estimate, it is sung in public more than 10m times every year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A short but fascinating book by James Walvin, a professor at the University of York and an expert on slavery, offers a cultural history of the song. Its origins explain its power. The author\u2014the \u201cwretch\u201d of the first verse\u2014was John Newton, an Englishman and former slave trader. \u201cSurely no one could be a greater libertine in principle or practice, more abandoned or more daring than I,\u201d he later wrote of his early life."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1748 Newton was caught in a brutal storm off the coast of Ireland. Sure he would die, he called out to God for help and underwent a religious conversion. \u201cI was a new man,\u201d he wrote. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In time, Newton left the slave trade. He was ordained as an Anglican vicar and became a central voice in the abolition movement. William Wilberforce, Britain\u2019s leading anti-slavery campaigner, often sought his advice. In 1772 Newton wrote the hymn as a cry of thanks for his own redemption from darkness. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cAmazing Grace\u201d has inspired many white believers, particularly during the Second Great Awakening that reinvigorated American Christianity in the early 19th century. But it has long been closely associated with African-American churches. The hymn crossed the Atlantic soon after it was written. Its \u201cdangers, toils and snares\u201d resonated deeply with American slaves, Mr Walvin writes, as did its promises of better things to come: \u201cIt was as if John Newton had been writing with the enslaved in mind.\u201d In 1835 the current tune was added, composed by William Walker, an American Baptist musician. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Perhaps most memorably, \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d became one of the anthems of the civil-rights movement in the mid-20th century. Mahalia Jackson, a gospel singer, would croon it over the phone to Martin Luther King when he was exhausted after a long day of marching. Mr Walvin calls it a \u201cperfect antidote to the turbulence gripping American life\u201d at that time.
