By Susanne Sundfor"}, {"role": "body", "text": "With this album Susanne Sundfor proves that she is one of pop\u2019s most brilliant performers. Her voice is so magnetic and emotive it would enchant audiences whatever tune she sings. Already a star in Norway, she deserves wider fame."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFalse Lankum\u201d. By Lankum"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A new wave of Irish folk is producing lots of stirring music, but none quite so stark as that on Lankum\u2019s fourth album. \u201cGo Dig My Grave\u201d might be the most uncompromising opening track of any album this year. (You are not likely to hear the band\u2019s music in an advert for Irish tourism.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFountain Baby\u201d. By Amaarae"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This album, by a Ghanian-American singer, is fizzy and sweet. The combination of Afrobeats, pop and R&amp;B gives \u201cFountain Baby\u201d an inventive, wonderfully contemporary sound."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cGold\u201d. By Cleo Sol"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cleo Sol, a British singer-songwriter, released two albums in September, both excellent: \u201cHeaven\u201d, a tour of the mellow soul of the 1970s, and \u201cGold\u201d, which is the better of the two, offering songs more varied in tone."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cGuts\u201d. By Olivia Rodrigo"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The former Disney star surfs the wave of nostalgia for the pop-punk of the 1990s with a snappy, snarky second album. You can hear her love of Taylor Swift in some of the delivery; \u201cGuts\u201d also connects with an audience of young women seeking a voice that echoes their lives."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cHeavy Heavy\u201d. By Young Fathers"}, {"role": "body", "text": "An album both accessible and experimental, by a multi-ethnic trio from Scotland. \u201cHeavy Heavy\u201d sounds as though it comes from everywhere and nowhere. One minute you get a glam-rock beat evocative of the 1970s, the next ululating vocals in Zimbabwe\u2019s Shona language."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cHit Parade\u201d. By R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The release of \u201cHit Parade\u201d was overshadowed by the culture wars, after R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy offered her opinions on puberty blockers. But behind the headlines lies a coolly confident album of dance-pop, full of infectious, summery melodies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cManzanita\u201d. By Shana Cleveland"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This album limns a poor, rural part of California that does not get much attention in pop. The music is beautiful, evoking genres popular in the 1960s, such as baroque pop and psychedelic folk. Ms Cleveland\u2019s voice is soft and affectless."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cNew Vietnam and Singles\u201d. By Civic"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Civic offers a raucous take on garage punk. The band belongs to an Australian lineage whose forebears include Radio Birdman, The Saints and The Scientists. This album is both a throwback and wildly exciting."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cPerfect Saviours\u201d. By The Armed"}, {"role": "body", "text": "On their fifth studio album, this hardcore-punk collective completed their transformation from shouty thrashers to experimental-pop group. \u201cPerfect Saviours\u201d shows off their melodic sensibilities."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe Price of Progress\u201d. By The Hold Steady"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The band\u2019s late-career revival continued with their ninth album. Craig Finn no longer sings about youngsters ending up in the emergency room after taking too many drugs. On \u201cThe Price of Progress\u201d he tells of older people losing control of their lives in less dramatic ways."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe Record\u201d. By Boygenius"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The rare \u201csupergroup\u201d that is bigger than the sum of its parts. No indie fan would be startled by their debut album, but what was new about it was the way it became a rallying point for young queer people of all stripes. Crucially, the songs were superb."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cScaring the Hoes\u201d. By Danny Brown and JPEGMafia"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This album defies description: a barrage of words from Danny Brown, a rapper, is accompanied by frenetic production from JPEGMafia. Here hip-hop is not party music but an exploration of how far the genre can be pushed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cStrays\u201d. By Margo Price"}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the beginning of her career Margo Price sang hardscrabble, often autobiographical, country. Her style has since evolved into a winning amalgam of modern Americana and classic rock. \u201cStrays\u201d, which incorporates synthesisers and drum machines, is a triumph."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cSundown\u201d. By Eddie Chacon"}, {"role": "body", "text": "It had long seemed as though Eddie Chacon would only be known as one half of Charles &amp; Eddie, the duo behind \u201cWould I Lie to You?\u201d, a hit in 1992. But a solo career that began in 2020 has now yielded a second short, glorious album of retro soul, both jazzy and introspective. \u25a0"}], "id": 71}
