The Eagle was unruffled by the financial crash of 2007-09; it scraped through covid-19 and its devastating social-distancing rules.

But so far, at least, the fear that Brexit might stem the flow of migrants to London has not been realised. In one of Brexit\u2019s ironies, other arrivals have more than compensated for the shortfall of Europeans. Partly as a result, London\u2019s population, which dipped during the pandemic, is nudging 9m and is expected to hit 10m by 2040. Taking into account the inflow of skills and students, says Jonathan Portes of King\u2019s College London, Brexit\u2019s effect on the city \u201chas if anything been positive\u201d, in terms of immigration, at least.

The first is that they already did lots of business with the world beyond Europe, receiving copious foreign direct investment (FDI) from America especially. London has become even more reliant on American investment since Brexit, observes Riccardo Crescenzi of the London School of Economics (lse). Worryingly, when downsizing and divestment are included, in 2021 there was a net outflow of foreign capital from both London and Britain for the first time since 1984.

Vacancy rates in commercial property in central London are high, in part because\u2014as elsewhere, only more so\u2014people are loth to kick the working-from-home (WFH) habit acquired during the pandemic. A recent survey for the Centre for Cities, also a think-tank, found that, on average, workers in central London were in the office 2.3 days per week, less than other Britons.

Yet networking, transport and entertainment possibilities mean the case for keeping a central-London HQ is stronger than for having a satellite office. Notably, the WFH culture has not led armies of Londoners to retreat beyond striking distance of the workplace.

A port city that adapted to the decline of its port, it was also an imperial capital that acclimatised to the loss of empire.
