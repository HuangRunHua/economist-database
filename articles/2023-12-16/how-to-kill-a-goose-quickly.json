It has many strengths. If you wish to know how to brain a goose, it is peerless (in brief, bludgeon it briskly). If you want to find out how to behead a pheasant or disembowel a rabbit, it is invaluable. If, however, you wish to encase these animals in a pie, it is less helpful. For its author, W.M.W. Fowler, a former bomber pilot, has this to say on pastry recipes: \u201cI cannot help you.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In fact, Fowler did have a suggested method for pastry-making. Take one telephone, he advised. Ring one nice female neighbour with it. Liberally baste her with drink (\u201cA couple of stiff gins\u201d); add seasoning (a liberal sprinkling of \u201cblandishments and flattery\u201d); and watch your timings (\u201cDON\u2019T kiss her till she has carried out her duties\u201d). Soon enough, you would have an \u201cexcellent dish\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cookery books are odd things. Reviewers might lavish their attention on literary novels but some of the real potboilers of the publishing industry are those with recipes. Joe Wicks, a strapping fitness-guru-cum-chef, has sold 3.7m books in Britain since his first book came out in 2015. In that same period, William Shakespeare has sold only 2.2m, George Orwell 1.8m and Charles Dickens a mere 1.4m."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Britons may buy cookery books, especially as presents during December, but they often don\u2019t use them. It is said that if someone cooks a single recipe from an entire book, then that is considered a success. To many the puzzle is less that such books sell well, more that they sell at all, especially in an age of free online recipes. \u201cI wonder [why] people buy cookery books,\u201d says Claudia Roden, an Egyptian-born British cookery writer. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For a long time, people didn\u2019t. The genre arose relatively recently. For centuries those who could cook, couldn\u2019t write; and those who could write, couldn\u2019t cook. Many early recipes appeared in \u201cbooks of secrets\u201d, odd compilations that blended one-part cookery with two-parts pure sorcery. One 16th-century volume advised its readers on everything from how to conserve quinces (add sugar) to how \u201cto comfort the heart, and take away melancholy\u201d (yet more sugar). It also has a less appetising entry on recognising \u201cAll the Vrines that betoken death\u201d. If your urine is red, black, green or blue, be worried\u2014and perhaps don\u2019t do any cooking."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Recipe books really took off with the rise of the middle classes. As a result they are infused with the flavour of social anxiety. Chapters from a book published in 1922 advise inexperienced hostesses how to correctly prepare \u201cA Little Supper After the Play\u201d, \u201cLuncheon For A Motor Excursion In Winter\u201d and a \u201cShooting-Party Luncheon\u201d. (It also offered a brusquely titled chapter called \u201cFor The Too Fat\u201d.) If such books were aimed mainly at people on the way up, they also catered to those on the way down. One book published in 1938 advised those who once had cooks but now lived in straitened circumstances (perhaps even in a \u201cbed-sitting room\u201d) on how long to hang a partridge before roasting it (\u201cfive to eight days\u201d). Where you should hang a partridge for a week in a bedsit it did not say. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cookbooks shine a light on societies well beyond Britain. In 2017 al-Qaeda, a terrorist group, started to produce a magazine called \u201cYour Home\u201d that was aimed at the good jihadi wife. It offered problem pages, tips on washing up and, of course, recipes. The recipe for jihadi mashed potatoes explained to its eager readers that, for a truly successful mash, you should boil the potatoes first and only then mash them. You suspect, says Dr Elisabeth Kendall, an Arabist and Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge, that \u201cit was written by guys\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ostensibly, recipe books are about food. In truth, says Bee Wilson, author of \u201cThe Secret of Cooking\u201d, they are about everything else, too. Cookery books are as evocative as any spell, able to conjure up worlds with a handful of words. Open something by Yotam Ottolenghi, a chef and restaurateur, and run your eye down its lists of esoteric ingredients, with their pomegranate molasses and za\u2019atar and rose harissa. You are instantly transported to the Middle East\u2014or at least to somewhere smug in north London. In \u201cCulinary Jottings for Madras\u201d, a \u201ctreatise\u2026for Anglo-Indian Exiles\u201d published in 1878, readers find themselves at the elbow of an English housewife as she learns how to make Victoria pudding in southern India at the height of the Raj. (It turns out to be easy enough: hand the recipe to your butler, who can hand it to your cook.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For all that recipes pretend to be instruction, they are often epitaphs for dying worlds. According to Dr Kendall, the jihadi recipes were produced when the beginnings of the MeToo movement meant that jihadis were worried women might start to \u201cget ideas\u201d. \u201cCountryman\u2019s Cooking\u201d may have opened with the line \u201cThis book is written for men\u201d but it came out just as Britain was becoming less willing to cater to them. Ms Roden began her first book on the cuisine of Egyptian Jews when they left Egypt after the six-day war in 1967. Cookery was \u201cthe only thing we could take along with us.
