First, its ally, Hamas, proved itself horrifyingly more effective than most observers had assumed in its attack on Israel on October 7th. Since then the other members of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d have demonstrated Iran\u2019s reach, striking Israeli and American targets from Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. The Houthis, Iran\u2019s proxies in Yemen, have attacked oil tankers in the Red Sea and fired missiles with a range of 800km, allowing Iran to threaten trade through the Suez canal, much as it already dominates passage to the Persian Gulf. \u201cThey\u2019re showing the world needs Iran if it wants to keep the Middle East stable,\u201d says a former UN diplomat in Tehran. In Washington, DC Republican politicians present the regional menace posed by Iran as proof of President Joe Biden\u2019s geopolitical incompetence.

In late 2022 widespread demonstrations, triggered by the death in custody of a woman who wore her hijab improperly, appeared to be close to toppling the regime. In the end it was the protests, not clerical rule, that died out. Iran\u2019s diplomatic and economic isolation is also easing. It has positioned itself as a crucial supplier of weapons to Russia. Oil exports, especially to China, are booming. In March China brokered a deal to restore diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. In August Iran was invited to join BRICS, the bloc of big emerging economies. And in September America agreed to unfreeze $6bn of Iranian assets as part of a prisoner exchange. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Iran is less confident than it appears. It has restrained attacks by its proxies. It signals support for Hamas, but does not go far enough to invite furious retribution from Israel and America, whose navy is now near its shores. That caution, in turn, reflects weakness in Iran\u2019s economy and simmering discontent among ordinary Iranians. Above all, Iran is on the verge of a change in leadership, owing to the age (84) and infirmity of its \u201csupreme leader\u201d, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The regime\u2019s focus is increasingly on securing its hold on power, not fomenting chaos abroad. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The clearest sign of this is that, having nurtured a network of regional troublemakers for decades, Iran suddenly seems reluctant to let them make too much trouble.

Hizbullah, a Lebanese militia allied with Iran, has been cautious, contenting itself with skirmishes and sporadic missile attacks across Israel\u2019s northern border. A long-awaited address in November by its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, amounted to 80 minutes of excuses. As Yoav Gallant, Israel\u2019s defence minister, put it, \u201cno one has come to [Hamas\u2019s] aid\u2014neither the Iranians nor Hizbullah.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Iranian officials still trot out their formula for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: a referendum of the \u201coriginal inhabitants\u201d of Palestine (not including Jews), which would vote to wipe Israel off the map.

Recognition of Israel is the Palestinians\u2019 \u201cown business, of course\u201d, says Mr Khamenei\u2019s foreign-policy adviser, Kamal Kharazzi. \u201cWe are not going to declare opposition to others.\u201d At the UN General Assembly on October 27th Iran voted in favour of a two-state solution, which would entail recognition of Israel, a break with a long-held policy of opposition. Mr Khamenei shocked hardliners recently by saying that Iran did not believe that \u201cJews or Zionists should be thrown into the sea.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not radicals,\u201d insists an Iranian diplomat.

Since October 7th Ismail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC\u2019s foreign arm, the Quds Force, has opened \u201ca joint operations room\u201d close to Syria\u2019s front line with Israel and launched combat drones from Syria deep into Israel.

While Hamas is causing havoc in the region, the attention of Iran\u2019s leaders is turning to its troubled domestic affairs. Mr Khamenei will not be in charge much longer. Many Iranians expect a succession crisis that could destabilise the regime. \u201cTo smooth the succession they need a better economy and less catastrophic foreign policy,\u201d says Yaser Mirdamadi, an Iranian religious scholar in exile.

That is what prompted Mr Khamenei, in the six months before October 7th, to cut by two-thirds production of uranium enriched to 60% u-235, to stop harassing American shipping in the Strait of Hormuz and to discourage proxy attacks on American targets. America, in turn, has turned a blind eye to trade in Iranian oil, which it subjects to sanctions. Oil exports soared fourfold, from 300,000 barrels a day (b/d) in 2022 to more than 1.2m b/d today. When Iran held back its proxies after Hamas\u2019s attack, Mr Biden quietly rewarded the regime by allowing Iraq to begin transferring $10bn it owed to Iran for outstanding energy bills.

Food prices are up by 40% year on year; the price of meat has risen at double that rate. The poverty rate has increased from 19% to 30% in a decade, according to official figures. More than 26m people, 30% of the population, live on less than $7 a day, an official poverty line. University lecturers moonlight as taxi-drivers.

Unfortunately, the government, led by President Ebrahim Raisi, is widely regarded as the Islamic Republic\u2019s most inept yet, as well as its most hardline. Most of his ministers are either IRGC veterans or graduates of Imam Sadiq, a seminary-cum-university in the capital with an ideological bent. They are ill-equipped. For the last six months they have imported petrol at market prices to make up a shortfall in local production. Even so they continue to subsidise it to keep the price to motorists at two cents a litre, for fear of the unrest that might follow a price hike. Earlier governments raided public pension funds. To deal with the resulting deficit, parliament last month decided that workers would have to stay in their jobs for an extra five years, prompting protests by pensioners."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Iran has much to offer foreign investors, but American sanctions, protectionism and mismanagement chase almost everyone away. China has signed copious memoranda of understanding, but is waiting for sanctions to be lifted to implement them. Saudi investment is conditional on a halt to Iranian support for its proxies.

In exchange for Iranian weapons, especially drones, for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Iranians say, Russia will invest in its oilfields and a north-south rail link to the Indian Ocean.

In an attempt to consolidate the system, Mr Khamenei has purged it of doubters. Elections for the Assembly of Experts, which chooses the supreme leader, and to the parliament are both due in March. But what was once a fairly competitive process increasingly resembles the staged showpieces of other Middle Eastern autocracies. Reformers and pragmatists have been purged from parliament.

Mr Khamenei may be grooming Mojtaba, his second son, but the heirs of a revolution that toppled one dynasty are reluctant to create another.

Some Iranians even embraced the regime\u2019s nemeses. Baristas in caf\u00e9s pinned stars of David to their aprons. When a regime loyalist waved a Palestinian flag at a football stadium in Tehran, fans roared to shove it up his backside.

University lecturers face expulsion for allowing women without headscarves into their halls. Caf\u00e9s flouting the code are fined and shut down. But the authorities cannot close all caf\u00e9s. In many, hardly a woman wears the headscarf. The Guardian Council, an assembly of clerics and notables that vets legislation, ruled in October against a chastity law passed by hardliners in parliament on the grounds that enforcement would be un-Islamic.

Many of the ideologues\u2019 children are as attracted to Western freedoms as other young Iranians. \u201cThey see life in Dubai or Turkey and are not going to obey the Islamic rules the regime dictated in the past,\u201d says an analyst in Tehran. Some observers suggest that Mojtaba Khamenei, if he succeeds his father, might emulate aspects of the rule of Muhammad bin Salman, the modernising authoritarian who governs Saudi Arabia. Iran might become more autocratic, but freer of religious strictures. Others see the IRGC as a likelier engine of change. According to the constitution, Mr Khamanei\u2019s successor must be a qualified cleric. But if the clerics could not agree on one, some IRGC generals might dictate the choice."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Over time, some analysts hope, the regional restraint the country has shown since October 7th might become the norm. Iran might begin to prefer maintenance of the status quo to revolutionary chaos. Its regional satellites already have dominant roles in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen; it might seek to consolidate rather than expand further. Some Israeli security analysts wonder whether, having restrained Hizbullah, Iran could be persuaded to relocate the movement\u2019s militants to the other side of the Litani river, 18 miles (29km) north of the Israeli border. A two-state settlement between Israel and the Palestinians could enable Iran to dial down its conflict with Israel. Iranians know that America is not likely to revive the moribund nuclear deal and lift sanctions in an election year. But while elusive, a comprehensive bargain with America in the medium term is conceivable. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Despite popular anger, the regime has little organised internal opposition. The opposition in exile is in disarray. Its most popular television channel, Manoto, recently announced its closure. Advocates of regime change have postponed their hopes until after America\u2019s election, which some wistfully hope will bring back Mr Trump and his policy of maximum pressure.
