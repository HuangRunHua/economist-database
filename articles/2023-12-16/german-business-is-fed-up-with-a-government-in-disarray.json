A \u20ac10bn subsidy for Intel, an American chipmaker, to erect a \u20ac30bn semiconductor factory, which would be post-war Germany\u2019s largest single foreign investment, seems to be in doubt.

It may also paint a flattering picture, since the survey was conducted before the budget fiasco.

Siegfried Russwurm, head of the BDI, Germany\u2019s main industry association, sees the draft spending bill as a \u201ctough austerity budget that will be a big burden for the economy and consumers\u201d.
