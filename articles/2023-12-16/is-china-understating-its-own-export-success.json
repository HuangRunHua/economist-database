The figure, which peaked at almost 10% of gdp in 2007, measures the gap between China\u2019s earning and its spending, driven largely by its trade surplus and the income it receives from its foreign assets. For much of the past two decades, China\u2019s surpluses have left it open to the charge of mercantilism\u2014of stealing jobs by unfairly boosting its exports. Some trading partners now worry about a similar shock if the country\u2019s output of electric vehicles grows too quickly."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But China\u2019s current-account surplus is now modest: $312bn or 1.5% of GDP over the past year, according to the country\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). That is below the 3% threshold that America\u2019s Treasury deems excessive."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Is the figure reliable? Some, such as Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations and Matthew Klein, a financial commentator, believe that the official numbers are dramatically understated. China\u2019s true surplus, Mr Klein reckons, is now \u201cabout as large as it has ever been, relative to the size of the world economy\u201d. They offer two arguments. First, China may be understating income from its foreign assets. Second, it may be understating exports."}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to SAFE, the income China earns on its stock of foreign assets plunged from mid-2021 to mid-2022. This seems odd given rising global interest rates. Mr Setser\u2019s alternative estimate, based on assumptions about China\u2019s assets, would add about $200bn to the surplus."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s goods surplus also appears smaller in SAFE\u2019s figures than it does in China\u2019s own customs data. The gap was $230bn over the past year. \u201cThat is real money, even for China,\u201d says Mr Setser."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China might take some comfort from a bigger surplus. But it has an unsettling implication. What is happening to the additional dollars China is earning? Since they are not showing up on the books of China\u2019s central bank or its state-owned banks, they must be offset by a hidden capital outflow. Such outflows typically end up in a residual category of the ledger. Mr Setser believes this residual should be about 2% of GDP, not the official figure of near zero.

It attributes the export gap largely to China\u2019s free-trade zones and similar enclaves. These lie inside China\u2019s territory but outside its official tariff border (see diagram). Goods leaving these enclaves for the rest of the world are counted as exports by customs but not by SAFE. Adam Wolfe of Absolute Strategy Research points out that these zones account for a growing share of China\u2019s exports. That may explain why the gap has emerged only in the past two years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Setser is unconvinced. If China\u2019s free-trade zones have enjoyed a dramatic export boom, it should produce ripples elsewhere. Wages earned by workers, for example, should appear as increased remittances. In fact, they have risen only a little. And as Mr Wolfe points out, even if the official current-account surplus is correctly calculated, it may be of little comfort to China\u2019s trading partners. After all, if the country\u2019s domestic demand remains weak, goods made in its free-trade zones may flood foreign markets. The rest of the world will count them, and experience them, as Chinese imports, even if SAFE does not count them as Chinese exports. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 58}
