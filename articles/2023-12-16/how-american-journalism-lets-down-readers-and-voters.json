Instead, in much of the mainstream media, journalism is in the grip of an illiberal bias. That includes the New York Times, which is best-placed of any of the country\u2019s newspapers to establish a common set of facts and frame of debate."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In an essay James Bennet, The Economist\u2019s Lexington columnist, and a former editorial-page editor of the New York Times, argues that its pledge to pursue the news \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d is no longer being honoured. Neither is the promise of the paper to \u201cinvite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion\u201d. Instead, pressure from left-leaning journalists and commercial staff who \u201cdo not believe readers can be trusted with potentially dangerous ideas or facts\u201d is undermining the Times\u2019s claims to independence."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the Times to assert that it plays by the same rules it always has \u201cis to commit a hypocrisy that is transparent to conservatives, dangerous to liberals and bad for the country as a whole,\u201d Mr Bennet writes. \u201cIt makes the Times too easy for conservatives to dismiss and too easy for progressives to believe. The reality is that the Times is becoming the publication through which America\u2019s progressive elite talks to itself about an America that does not really exist.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bennet\u2019s article belongs to a package of stories in The Economist this week that looks at the American media in the run-up to next year\u2019s election. This includes a profile of the conservative media, and a deep-dive data analysis of over 600,000 pieces of tv and written journalism. This shows that the language of the mainstream American media has drifted away from the political centre and towards the Democratic Party\u2019s preferred terminology and topics. That could lower the media\u2019s credibility among conservatives."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bennet was asked to resign from the Times in 2020, after his pages published an op-ed by Tom Cotton, a senator from Arkansas, that caused a newsroom revolt. America was reeling after George Floyd, an African-American man, had been murdered by a white policeman in Minneapolis. Throughout the country, protesters were on the march. Reform of the police seemed possible, but, because of the violence and looting in some cities, so did a political backlash."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Times Opinion had published pieces calling for the abolition of the police and opposing the use of troops to stop the violence, but Mr Cotton argued they were needed to protect lives and businesses from rioters, leading the journalists\u2019 union to describe his op-ed as \u201ca clear threat to the health and safety of journalists we represent\u201d. After three days of upheaval, The Times asked Mr Bennet to step down and leave the paper."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In his essay, Mr Bennet chronicles how changes in recruitment, training, newspapers\u2019 business models and intellectual fashion combined to change the New York Times, as it is changing so many workplaces in America. Amid the internal upheaval at the paper before he left, he came to see \u201cthe ones who were caught up in Slack or Twitter storms, as people who had only recently discovered that they were white and were still getting over the shock.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "He argues that A.G. Sulzberger, the newspaper\u2019s hereditary publisher, needs to stand up to that faction. \u201cLeaders of many workplaces and boardrooms across America find that it is so much easier to compromise than to confront\u2014to give a little ground today in the belief you can ultimately bring people around\u201d, he writes. \u201cThis is how reasonable Republican leaders lost control of their party to Trump and how liberal-minded college presidents lost control of their campuses. And it is why the leadership of the New York Times is losing control of its principles.\u201d Mr Sulzberger declined to be interviewed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A spokeswoman said: \u201cThe New York Times believes unequivocally in the principle of independence, as has been demonstrated consistently by our journalism.\u201d She added that \u201cin the case of the Tom Cotton op-ed, the handling of such a sensitive piece, specifically the decision to rush it into publication without key leaders having read it because it was \u2018newsy\u2019, made it unusually vulnerable to attack.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bennet calls for journalists and comment pages to equip readers with the best information to form their own judgments. \u201cThe journalist\u2019s role [is] to be a sworn witness; the readers\u2019 role [is] to be judge and jury,\u201d he writes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bennet thinks that opinion journalism also benefits from giving readers a range of voices. \u201cIt matters that conflicting views do not just appear before different audiences in politically rivalrous publications or cable news networks,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut instead in the same forum, before the same readers, subject to the same standards for fact and argumentation.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much more than the New York Times is at stake. Mr Bennet argues that: \u201cIt is hard to imagine a path back to saner American politics that does not traverse a common ground of shared fact.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "And he issues a stern warning to his compatriots. As long as Americans are afraid or unwilling to listen to each other, \u201cit is equally hard to imagine how America\u2019s diversity can continue to be a source of strength, rather than become a fatal flaw.\u201d"}], "id": 25}
