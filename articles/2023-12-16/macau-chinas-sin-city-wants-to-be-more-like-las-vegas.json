The crowds have returned to the Venetian Macao, a resort with gondoliers and gaming tables. It and other casinos in Macau, the world\u2019s largest gambling centre by revenue, were hit hard by the pandemic as China closed its borders. Tax receipts from the city\u2019s gaming sector fell by 85% from 2019 to 2022. But now they are surging again. More people visited Macau in the first nine months of 2023 than in the preceding three years combined (see chart)."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231216_CNC737.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Macau\u2019s future still feels uncertain. So long as gambling remains illegal in mainland China, the city and its casinos should do well. But under Xi Jinping the national government has taken a dim view of vice. The state\u2019s actions have already changed the way Macau operates. Over the coming decade, they are likely to reshape the place. Macau is under pressure to follow the model of Las Vegas, which has diversified its leisure offerings and become more family-friendly. China\u2019s sin city, though, is struggling to adjust."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Things began to change for Macau with the ascendance of Mr Xi, who launched the largest anti-corruption campaign in Chinese history soon after taking power in 2012. Part of that effort was aimed at the city, a former Portuguese colony that has been an autonomous region of China since 1999. Like neighbouring Hong Kong, it has its own currency that is, in effect, pegged to the dollar. Mainland officials and entrepreneurs often used the city\u2019s casinos as conduits for money-laundering or exit routes for ill-gotten gains. High-rollers would circumvent China\u2019s strict capital controls by taking winnings in foreign currencies or staging losses and paying the \u201cdebt\u201d into a foreign bank account."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Xi\u2019s campaign has put an end to much of that activity. In 2021 the government went after \u201cjunket\u201d operators, who bring high-rollers from the mainland to Macau\u2019s casinos (and often arrange credit to finance their betting). Alvin Chau, the boss of the biggest junket group, Suncity, was arrested that year and is now serving an 18-year prison sentence for illegal gambling, fraud and involvement in a criminal organisation. Macau\u2019s gaming regulator has slashed the number of junket licences it issues. In 2011 nearly three-quarters of the city\u2019s gaming revenue came from high-rollers; last year less than a quarter did."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Macau\u2019s future depends on it attracting a broader audience. In 2019 mass-market gaming accounted for more than half of casinos\u2019 earnings for the first time. But it is harder to make money from vast numbers of regular punters than it is from smaller groups of high-rollers. In the 2010s, as the number of tourists in Macau rose, their average expenditure fluctuated. This year it is down compared with last year. At the Venetian Macao, tables with high minimum bets attract few customers. Poker tables, introduced to bring in new clientele, are largely empty. (Most people play baccarat.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The casinos are suffering a \u201clong hangover\u201d from the pandemic, says a staff member. But the problem goes beyond that. Macau\u2019s tax take peaked in 2013. In 2019, before covid-19 hit and despite a record number of visitors to the city, government revenue was down 25% from its high six years earlier."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Before the pandemic Macau made most of its money (around 80%) from gambling\u2014unlike Las Vegas, which makes more from non-gaming sources such as shows. Over the past decade Macau\u2019s resorts have invested billions of dollars to expand their offerings, increasing entertainment and shopping options. Much more is planned. Last year the city\u2019s government agreed to renew the licences for the six largest gambling operators for ten years starting in 2023. But they had to pledge to spend $13bn on non-gaming projects and efforts to draw foreign tourists."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Raising the stakes"}, {"role": "body", "text": "One operator, Galaxy Entertainment Group, has vowed to build the city\u2019s \u201cfirst and only high-tech amusement park\u201d. Another, Sands China, will add a glass conservatory to the 50,000-square-metre garden next to its Londoner Macao resort (with its own Big Ben and King\u2019s Guard). Other developments aim to attract business travellers with upgraded spaces for meetings and conventions. Some wonder if there is a big enough market for these offerings."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231216_CNM973.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 625.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Xi has urged local governments to invest in the \u201cGreater Bay Area\u201d, which encompasses Macau, Hong Kong and much of Guangdong province (see map). Some of Macau\u2019s casino groups are planning to build non-gaming resorts in the region. The 55km Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge has linked up those cities, but it also makes it easier for visitors to spend just a day\u2014not a night\u2014in Macau. The gaming hub\u2019s neighbours are also getting in the way of its other ambitions. In recent years Macau has tried to develop its financial industry and to depict itself as a centre for technology and innovation, but it has struggled to compete with Hong Kong and Shenzhen in those areas."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pessimists point to other challenges. Slowing economic growth on the mainland could mean fewer domestic tourists. The flight of rich expats from Hong Kong will not help. It is unclear where new international custom will come from, particularly given the rise of gambling hubs in South-East Asia."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Betting on Beijing"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then there are Sino-American relations. Three of Macau\u2019s biggest casino groups are largely American-owned: MGM, Sands and Wynn. Their operations in the city form a big part of their overall businesses. They were reassured when their licences were renewed, though the ten-year commitment was shorter than the previous two-decade deals. If tensions between America and China were to rise even higher, some fear the government in Beijing would order mainland firms to take a greater stake in the businesses."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though nominally administered under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle, Macau tends to follow the Communist Party\u2019s lead. The media and schools instil loyalty to the mainland. A security law, known as Article 23, is there to punish treason and secessionism (or anything that resembles it). In 2021 pro-democracy candidates were disqualified from running in Macau\u2019s legislative elections. The city\u2019s chief executive, Ho Iat Seng, is pro-Beijing. The party hand-picked the officials in charge of justice and public security."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One reason why Macau is less demanding of democracy than Hong Kong is because its GDP per person is usually among the highest in the world (the pandemic knocked it back). But Macau\u2019s loyalty and riches will not necessarily shield it from Mr Xi\u2019s wrath. He appears to have a deep-seated suspicion of the gaming industry. And his push for \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d aims to reduce the type of inequality that is often on display in Macau. If the city can become a little more wholesome, Mr Xi might be more inclined to tolerate it. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 20}
