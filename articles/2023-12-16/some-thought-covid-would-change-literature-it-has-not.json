Since the \u201cIliad\u201d, literature has documented\u2014and been shaped by\u2014disease, including Daniel Defoe\u2019s semi-fictional testimony of London during the pestilence of 1655, \u201cA Journal of the Plague Year\u201d (1722), and Albert Camus\u2019s imagining of a cholera outbreak in a French-controlled Algerian city, \u201cThe Plague\u201d (1947). Who would write the first great pandemic novel of the covid era?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Two of America\u2019s most distinguished novelists, Michael Cunningham and Sigrid Nunez, have published novels that try to carry this mantle. Despite their new subject matter, however, these books do not break literary ground. Covid did not, as some had predicted, permanently change the way people lived. As fear of the virus ebbed, they snapped back to old habits. The same is proving true for fiction."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The narrator of \u201cThe Vulnerables\u201d, like Ms Nunez (pictured on next page), is an older writer who lives in New York. She ends up isolating in a luxury apartment with a friend\u2019s parrot, pointedly named Eureka, and a bratty 20-something, whom she slowly grows to appreciate. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This writer has all the stereotypical concerns of a middle-aged, middle-class American, but her real covid crisis is literary. Suffering from writer\u2019s block, she concludes that \u201cthe traditional novel\u201d has lost its \u201curgency\u201d. Now readers want \u201ca literature of personal history and reflection: direct, authentic, scrupulous about fact\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like \u201cThe Friend\u201d, which drew on Ms Nunez\u2019s own life and won the National Book Award in 2018, \u201cThe Vulnerables\u201d reads as autobiographical fiction. In recent years juggernauts of \u201cautofiction\u201d, including Rachel Cusk and Karl Ove Knausgaard, have turned away from this style. (Genre and historical fiction, rather than literature focused on the first person, is ascendant.) Ms Nunez\u2019s narrator, whose reflections on life, art and children read like a boomer\u2019s pandemic diary, is familiar\u2014and not in a good way."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Cunningham\u2019s \u201cDay\u201d is the kind of traditional novel about imaginary people Ms Nunez suggests is now obsolete. But it is much more alive precisely because it looks from the outside in, rather than staying locked in a single head. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Set on April 5th across three years (2019, 2020 and 2021), \u201cDay\u201d tells the story of a young family in Brooklyn. Dan, an ageing rock\u2019n\u2019roller, and Isabel, a photo editor, have two young children and their fair share of burnout. Covid accelerates the unravelling of their marriage and the relationships of several other people they know. \u201cDay\u201d is alive with all of the small thoughts, looks and feelings that covid amplified, like \u201cthe isolated inhabitedness\u201d of Dan\u2019s days."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Coincidentally, both \u201cThe Vulnerables\u201d and \u201cDay\u201d offer tribute to Virginia Woolf, a celebrated British writer. Ms Nunez begins and ends considering a line from Woolf\u2019s \u201cThe Years\u201d (\u201cIt was an uncertain spring\u201d). Mr Cunningham shares the day-long focus of Woolf\u2019s \u201cMrs Dalloway\u201d, which he also employed in his Pulitzer-prizewinning novel, \u201cThe Hours\u201d (1998). But, unlike Woolf, neither of these novelists pushes the boundaries of fiction for their era. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unlike other historical traumas\u2014the first and second world wars, or September 11th\u2014the pandemic\u2019s impact on fiction, as on art more generally, has so far been muted. With lockdown an increasingly distant memory, Ms Nunez\u2019s and Mr Cunningham\u2019s books may be most significant as historical novels set in a time that now seems stranger than fiction. They are documents of a new normal that soon slipped right back into the old. Both novels remind readers how much their lives changed during the pandemic, but also, at least for writers and readers of literary fiction, how much stayed the same. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 70}
