The campaign team of F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, who is running to be re-elected president in a vote scheduled for December 20th, set itself the task of showing reporters something impressive near Lubumbashi, Congo\u2019s second-biggest city. The journalist-jammed bus made wrong turns, repeatedly asked villagers for directions and twice nearly became mired in mud. Eventually it found a few half-built classrooms and an unfinished clinic. Yet locals are delighted. Mr Tshisekedi \u201cdoes beautiful things!\u201d beams Nadia, a young mother. After years of neglect by politicians some Congolese are understandably pleased with any sign of progress. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Congo should have achieved much more. It stretches from Africa\u2019s west coast to its centre and has a youthful population of 100m. It has large amounts of the minerals needed for the transition to green energy, producing 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt. Yet after brutish rule by Belgium\u2019s king, a chaotic passage to independence in 1960 and a long dictatorship, it is one of the weakest states in the world. Many major cities are not connected to each other by all-weather roads. Some 60% of Congolese live on less than $2.15 a day, an international standard of extreme poverty. The state has no control of large chunks of territory. Corrupt politicians, other African countries and rebel groups plunder its minerals. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A war has ravaged much of the east for almost three decades. It has recently worsened. m23, an armed group, has been fighting towards Goma, the biggest eastern city. Some 450,000 people were displaced in the six weeks to the end of November, bringing the total to nearly 7m, a number exceeded only in Sudan. It could get worse. M23 is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, whose army also appears to be fighting in Congo. (Rwanda denies this.) In November Avril Haines, America\u2019s intelligence chief, met the presidents of both countries to try to avert an open cross-border war. At a rally near the Rwandan border this month Mr Tshisekedi raised the tension, saying to a cheering crowd that Rwanda\u2019s president, Paul Kagame, was acting like Hitler and \u201cwill end up like Hitler\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This month\u2019s elections, for offices from president to municipal councillor, are an opportunity and a danger. They give Congolese a chance to choose leaders who could reduce poverty and make progress towards peace. Yet they will be a shambles, and could be stolen outright. Voters seem to have been cheated in the last election, in 2018. According to leaked official data, Martin Fayulu, a former ExxonMobil executive, won 59% of the vote, compared with 19% for Mr Tshisekedi. Yet, allegedly after a backroom deal with the outgoing president, Joseph Kabila, Mr Tshisekedi was named the winner. (Both deny any deal.) America endorsed the result."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The electoral process is a mirror of Congo\u2019s disarray. The problems begin with the electoral law, under which the candidate who gets more votes than any other in a single round becomes president. With 26 candidates on the ballot, the winner might have a weak popular mandate\u2014and no mandate at all, if the vote is rigged. The war in the east will prevent 1.7m Congolese from voting at all. Opposition candidates have no trust in the new head of the electoral commission (CENI), Denis Kadima. \u201cNothing is happening correctly, it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d says Mo\u00efse Katumbi, an opposition candidate. Six candidates are suing Mr Kadima, alleging \u201cintentional irregularities\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Among them are voter identity cards that are so badly printed that the person\u2019s name and photo rub off. Eric Nsenga, of the Protestant and Catholic churches\u2019 election-observation mission, estimates that 70% of cards are illegible. Mr Kadima says that he will announce measures to allow people with smudged cards to vote. But that may heighten fears of rigging."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Opposition candidates do not trust the electoral rolls. Unlike in the last election, when an independent institution vetted them, CENI has this time appointed auditors, who did the job in six days. That is not enough time, says the observation mission of the Carter Centre, an American NGO. Mr Kadima points out that an external audit is not legally required. The EU drastically scaled back its electoral-observation mission in late November because the government would not let it import equipment such as satellite phones. There will be domestic observers, but Mr Kadima encourages mistrust in them. Many \u201chave already chosen their side\u201d, he claims."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even now the vote may be delayed. The papers for reporting the results from each polling station to CENI arrived in Kinshasa only on December 9th. In nearly roadless Congo it may be impossible to deliver them to 75,000 stations in 11 days. Technically and logistically this election is Congo\u2019s worst ever, says Mr Nsenga. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Western diplomats are strangely upbeat. One talks of Congo\u2019s \u201cvibrant\u201d democracy, while conceding that the election is likely to be \u201cmessy and highly flawed\u201d. The diplomat suggests that \u201cby and large\u201d people may still be able to \u201cexpress their will\u201d. As in 2018, much of the West may endorse a questionable result. Such an outcome could trigger violence or, some fear, a coup. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be like Gabon,\u201d a nearby country where soldiers seized power in August after a dodgy election, warns Mr Katumbi. Tensions are rising. On December 12th live rounds were fired and several people were injured as he spoke at a rally."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231216_MAC713.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Tshisekedi might well win without chicanery.

But he can point to an economy that has grown at rates of between 6% and 9% over the past three years, thanks to rising mineral prices.

The number of people living on less than $2.15 a day is higher than when Mr Tshisekedi took office. Life in Lubumbashi is easily summed up, says John, a 28-year-old university graduate who sells phone credits for a living: \u201cLa mis\u00e8re.\u201d The franc has slumped.

Worst of all, death and displacement in the east have sharply increased since Mr Tshisekedi took office (see chart 2).

Questions have been raised about the sources of his wealth. Yet, though he was a legal target of Mr Kabila\u2019s regime, prosecutors did not pin corruption charges on him. Asked about rumours of corruption, Mr Katumbi sends an aide to fetch a huge poster of him in a hard hat at a mine in 1997. \u201cI didn\u2019t go [into politics] with empty pockets,\u201d he says.
