An altarpiece originally intended for the basilica of Santo Spirito in Florence, it subsequently travelled west in Tuscany to the cathedral of Pescia.

It will be on display in Pescia\u2019s cathedral (again) from May 11th to July 30th, alongside a copy by Pier Dandini that was commissioned to replace it in the 1690s. This time its voyage is part of an innovative experiment in curation. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The show is the latest to be staged by the Uffizi galleries, which include Palazzo Pitti, in a project that their director, Eike Schmidt, has dubbed the \u201cUffizi diffusi\u201d (the \u201cextended\u201d or \u201cscattered\u201d Uffizi). The aim is to give the public a chance to see paintings and sculptures in places where they have a special relevance. Often the art on display would otherwise be hidden away in the Uffizi\u2019s storerooms (though that is not the case with the \u201cMadonna of the Baldacchino\u201d)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the first such exhibition, in 2021, artworks associated with Napoleon Bonaparte were shown at Portoferraio on the island of Elba, to which the French emperor was exiled in 1814 (he escaped the following year). Another was held in the village where Andrea del Castagno was born and featured his portrait of Dante Alighieri. The Tuscan hill town of Anghiari, site of a battle between Florence and Milan in the 15th century, was chosen for a show on the links between culture and warfare. \u201cSome places just want to have an exhibition,\u201d comments Mr Schmidt. \u201cIn other cases, the authorities want us to leave the works behind indefinitely.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now, after more than 30 such shows, the project is entering a new phase: the creation of a network of permanent satellite museums in various parts of Tuscany. To an extent, the Uffizi is following the examples of the Louvre, which has opened a branch at Lens, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which now has an outpost in Dundee. But Mr Schmidt\u2019s scheme is both more local and more ambitious. Within a few years, he plans to inaugurate satellite Uffizis in up to four locations in Tuscany, each with a particular speciality and together displaying hundreds of works."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first in line to open is the Villa Ambrogiana at Montelupo Fiorentino, which overlooks the River Arno west of Florence. As Mr Schmidt explains, this was one of the biggest of the villas owned by the Medicis, the dynasty that ruled Florence for three centuries, \u201cyet the only one not on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List, because it was not accessible to the public\u201d. Until 2017 the huge villa, which has a tower at each of its four corners, served as a psychiatric prison. It is currently undergoing a \u20ac24m ($26m) restoration. After that, the plan is to bring back several hundred paintings and sculptures that were taken to the Uffizi in the 18th century."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another Medici villa, in the Florentine suburb of Careggi, is also being restored with a view to becoming a part of the Uffizi network. And Mr Schmidt has set his sights on a couple of former health spas: the Terme Excelsior at Montecatini Terme, which might house some of the Uffizi\u2019s works from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the Terme del Corallo in Livorno, on the Tuscan coast, which has been earmarked for an \u201cUffizi of the Sea\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The project has already been the subject of a scholarly study, published in the International Journal of Cultural Policy. \u201cIt could provide a model for regional museums in other parts of Italy and indeed the world,\u201d says the study\u2019s author, Serena Giusti of the Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna in Pisa. But much remains to be done. The Livorno scheme requires what Mr Schmidt blithely terms \u201ca reconfiguration of the centre of the city\u201d. And the site is in a deplorable state. \u201cWhen we first went there, it was full of mud,\u201d says Mr Schmidt, turning to German Romantic painting for a worthy simile: \u201cLike\u2026well\u2026a landscape with ruins by Caspar Friedrich.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 62}
