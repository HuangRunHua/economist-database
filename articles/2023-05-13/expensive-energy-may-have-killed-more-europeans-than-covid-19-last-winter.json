Comparing actual deaths with the number we might expect given mortality in the same weeks of 2015-19, we found that deaths across Europe were higher than expected. Across 28 European countries we investigated, there were 149,000 excess deaths between November 2022 and February 2023, equivalent to a 7.8% increase."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Several factors might explain this rise. Among those that died last winter, nearly 60,000 were recorded as covid-19 deaths. The disease probably contributed\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014to more, but it is unlikely that it can account for all of last winter\u2019s surge. Between March 2020 and September 2022 the official covid death count was 79% of total excess deaths among our 28 countries. Last winter it was 40%."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The weather has also affected the number of deaths. A cold snap in December was accompanied by a rise in mortality. A drop of 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) in the average temperature over a three-week period is associated with a 2.2% rise in total deaths. However, last winter was milder than the average of 2015-19, so the cold alone cannot be responsible for the additional deaths.
