Relief because South Sudan, which seceded from Sudan in 2011, seems somewhat insulated from the chaos. Fear because Sudan\u2019s violence may nevertheless spill over the border between the two, exacerbating the conflicts that still rage in the world\u2019s newest country. And d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu because what is happening in Sudan today looks like a repeat of events in South Sudan in its years after independence, when the West\u2019s well-intentioned attempts at peacemaking and state-building ended in war and anarchy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The complex causes of wars in the two Sudans date back decades, if not centuries. The men who choose to butcher their countrymen are most directly responsible. Yet since two rival armies went to war over Khartoum, Sudan\u2019s capital, on April 15th there has been a tsunami of criticism of the diplomacy employed by the West and regional governments in their failed bid to avert conflict. Much of it has been self-recrimination, with diplomats and former officials agonising over missteps and whether they could have done things differently. But a feeling is afoot that the very model of \u201cconflict resolution\u201d widely employed in such cases is flawed. If these mistakes are not addressed, the latest efforts to silence the guns in Sudan, which began in Saudi Arabia on May 6th, are doomed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the heart of peacemaking in Sudan was an effort to get two military strongmen to share power after their coup in April 2019. This was triggered by sustained street protests that led to the toppling of Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled Sudan as a dictator since 1989. But it was a half-finished revolution. Seeing Mr Bashir was about to fall, his armed forces booted him out and grabbed power for themselves."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230513_MAM100.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 704.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The putsch was led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as Hemedti), who led a militia-turned-paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). To break the will of demonstrators, the security forces massacred more than 100 people in June 2019. Soon after this, diplomats cobbled together a power-sharing deal hoping to prevent more bloodshed. Ostensibly it was for a \u201ccivilian-led\u201d transition to democracy, but in fact all the power was still held by the army and RSF. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The strategy of focusing on the men with guns was well meaning, if also expedient. With no clear leadership among the bouquet of \u201cresistance committees\u201d that had blossomed in Khartoum, it was not easy to know which civilians to include in the talks. This difficulty was exacerbated by a risk-averse culture that tends to keep diplomats in conference rooms and cocktail parties rather than on the streets. \u201cOf course not,\u201d an American diplomat said in 2019, when asked whether he had mingled with protesters. \u201cWe would not be allowed.\u201d Perhaps the biggest flaw was that the deal was premised on the idea that General Burhan and Mr Dagalo could be trusted when they told negotiators that they would hand over power to civilians.

Sudan, like many fragile countries, can be understood as a political marketplace where the main currency is violence. The SAF and RSF were \u201ctwo protection rackets trying to corner the market\u201d, says a former Western diplomat. The coup in 2021 was prompted by fears in the army that efforts to crack down on the military\u2019s economic interests were gathering pace\u2014and, simultaneously, by concerns that Mr Dagalo would profit from any fire-sale of assets held by the army\u2019s vast networks, says the diplomat.

This trend is because of the incentives inherent in fragile or \u201ctransitional\u201d democracies, where bigwigs use violence to bargain for power that is then made formal in peace deals.

In 2013 the two took their young country back to civil war, at a cost of about 400,000 lives. Though it nominally ended in 2018, localised violence continues.
