But they are divided over how to build a future."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At times statehood has beckoned. In 1993 Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), the Palestinians\u2019 representative body, signed the Oslo accords that provided for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank under a Palestinian National Authority (PA) and an end to Israel\u2019s occupation within five years.

Hamas, an armed Palestinian Islamist movement, won a general election in 2005 and set up a separate administration in Gaza, leaving an enfeebled PA to run bits of the West Bank.

Israel controls its borders, sea and air space so its 2.2m people feel besieged, as if in an open-air prison. Income per person is less than a third that of the West Bank.

With no prospect of negotiations and foreign mediation, over 40% of Palestinians favour violence against Israel, according to a poll conducted by Zimam, a Palestinian ngo in Ramallah, and funded by the eu.

Over 70% have lost hope in a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine co-existing side by side."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Palestinian support for a two-state deal is highest among Israel\u2019s 1.7m Arab citizens. Their income of $36,500 a head (measured in 2019) is eight times what Palestinian West Bankers earn and 30 times that of Gazans, at the last count. Alone among Palestinians under Israel\u2019s control, they can vote and carry the same passports as Jewish Israelis. An Arab-Israeli party was part of Israel\u2019s previous coalition government.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Opinion polls suggest that the vast majority of Palestinians want a true democracy. Some of the Western donors on whom the Palestinians rely have urged Mr Abbas to hold presidential and parliamentary elections that might bring Gaza and the West Bank back together under a single authority. It could rejuvenate its leadership and legitimise it, in the event of negotiations with Israel. Even Hamas, still ostracised as a terrorist organisation by most Western countries, has told diplomats it would accept a limit to the size of its representation in a new Palestinian parliament and would not bid for the presidency.

Opinion polls suggest that over 40% of voters\u2014and a majority in the West Bank\u2014want \u201cnone of the above\u201d, preferring a pragmatic leadership to tackle the poverty and corruption currently winked at by what they see as brutal Israeli overlords. For the moment neither model\u2014one state or two\u2014looks remotely feasible.
