Openai\u2019s chatbots, which use large-language-model (llm) technology, got the ball rolling in November. Now barely a day goes by without some mind-blowing advance. An ai-powered song featuring a fake \u201cDrake\u201d and \u201cThe Weeknd\u201d recently shook the music industry. Programs which convert text to video are making fairly convincing content. Before long consumer products such as Expedia, Instacart and OpenTable will plug into Openai\u2019s bots, allowing people to order food or book a holiday by typing text into a box. A recently leaked presentation, reportedly from a Google engineer, suggests the tech giant is worried about how easy it is for rivals to make progress. There is more to come\u2014probably a lot more.

Many have grand expectations. New research by Goldman Sachs, a bank, suggests that \u201cwidespread ai adoption could eventually drive a 7% or almost $7trn increase in annual global gdp over a ten-year period.\u201d Academic studies point to a three-percentage-point rise in annual labour-productivity growth in firms that adopt the technology, which would represent a huge uplift in incomes compounded over many years. A study published in 2021 by Tom Davidson of Open Philanthropy, a grantmaking outfit, puts a more than 10% chance on \u201cexplosive growth\u201d\u2014defined as increases in global output of more than 30% a year\u2014sometime this century.

In the past year share prices of companies involved in ai have done worse than the global average, although they have risen in recent months (see chart 1). Interest rates are another clue. If people thought that the technology was going to make everyone richer tomorrow, rates would rise because there would be less need to save. Inflation-adjusted rates and subsequent gdp growth are strongly correlated, notes research by Basil Halperin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (mit) and colleagues. Yet since the hype about ai began in November, long-term rates have fallen. They remain very low by historical standards. Financial markets, the researchers conclude, \u201care not expecting a high probability of\u2026ai-induced growth acceleration\u2026on at least a 30-to-50-year time horizon.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To judge which group is right, it is helpful to consider the history of previous technological breakthroughs. This provides succour to investors. For it is difficult to make the case that a single new technology by itself has ever radically changed the economy, either for good or ill. Even the industrial revolution of the late 1700s, which many people believe was the result of the invention of the spinning jenny, was actually caused by all sorts of factors coming together: increasing use of coal, firmer property rights, the emergence of a scientific ethos and much more besides.

In fact, it had a very modest impact, Fogel found, because it replaced technology\u2014such as canals\u2014that would have done just about as good a job.

Assume that all of the revenue turns into profits, which is unrealistic, and that all of these profits are earned in America, which is a tad more realistic. Even under these conditions, the ratio of the country\u2019s pre-tax corporate profits to its gdp would rise from 12% today to 14%. That is far above the long-run average, but no higher than it was in the second quarter of 2021. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These profits could go to one organisation\u2014maybe Openai. Monopolies often arise when an industry has high fixed costs or when it is hard to switch to competitors.

Generative ai has some monopolistic characteristics. gpt-4, one of Openai\u2019s chatbots, reportedly cost more than $100m to train, a sum few firms have lying around. There is also a lot of proprietary knowledge about data for training the models, not to mention user feedback. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is, however, little chance of a single company bestriding the entire industry. More likely is that a modest number of big firms compete with one another, as happens in aviation, groceries and search engines. No ai product is truly unique since all use similar models. This makes it easier for a customer to switch from one to another. The computing power behind the models is also fairly generic.

In the past decade the average rich-world unemployment rate has roughly halved (see chart 2). The share of working-age people in employment is at an all-time high.

Evidence for \u201chollowing out\u201d is mixed. Measures of job satisfaction rose during the 2010s. For most of the past decade the poorest Americans have seen faster wage growth than the richest ones. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This time could be different.

Some folk could move to industries experiencing worker shortages, such as hospitality.

The automated telephone switching system\u2014a replacement for human operators\u2014was invented in 1892. It took until 1921 for the Bell System to install their first fully automated office. Even after this milestone, the number of American telephone operators continued to grow, peaking in the mid-20th century at around 350,000. The occupation did not (mostly) disappear until the 1980s, nine decades after automation was invented. ai will take less than 90 years to sweep the labour market: llms are easy to use, and many experts are astonished by the speed at which the general public has incorporated Chatgpt into their lives. But reasons for the slow adoption of technology in workplaces will also apply this time around."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a recent essay Mark Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz outlined some of them. His argument focuses on regulation. In bits of the economy with heavy state involvement, such as education and health care, technological change tends to be pitifully slow. The absence of competitive pressure blunts incentives to improve. Governments may also have public-policy goals, such as maximising employment levels, which are inconsistent with improved efficiency. These industries are also more likely to be unionised\u2014and unions are good at preventing job losses. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Examples abound.

Fourteen of the top 20 occupations most exposed to ai are teachers (foreign-language ones are near the top; geographers are in a slightly stronger position). But only the bravest government would replace teachers with ai. Imagine the headlines. The same goes for cops and crime-fighting ai.

But the delay will make space for the economy to do what it always does: create new types of jobs as others are eliminated. By lowering costs of production, new tech can create more demand for goods and services, boosting jobs that are hard to automate. A paper published in 2020 by David Autor of mit and colleagues offered a striking conclusion. About 60% of the jobs in America did not exist in 1940. The job of \u201cfingernail technician\u201d was added to the census in 2000. \u201cSolar photovoltaic electrician\u201d was added just five years ago.

Adoption of electricity in factories and households began in America towards the end of the 19th century. Yet there was no productivity boom until the end of the first world war. The personal computer was invented in the 1970s. This time the productivity boom followed more quickly\u2014but it still felt slow at the time.

Still, though, global productivity growth remains weak."}, {"role": "body", "text": "ai could eventually make some industries vastly more productive.

Blue-collar work, such as construction and farming, which accounts for about 20% of rich-world gdp, is one example. An llm is of little use to someone picking asparagus.

So it is hard to imagine that, in a few years\u2019 time, blue-collar work is going to be much more productive than it is now.
