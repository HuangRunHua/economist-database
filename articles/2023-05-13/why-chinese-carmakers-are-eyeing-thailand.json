The South-East-Asian country\u2019s early presence in the automotive supply chains means it is the tenth-largest producer of cars in the world, surpassing countries like France and Britain."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today Thailand is once again a waypoint for the international ambitions of carmakers\u2014this time from China. Chinese companies have been announcing investments in Thai factories left and right. In March BYD, which in the first quarter overtook Volkswagen as the best-selling car firm in China, broke ground on an EV factory in Rayong, already a carmaking hub. In April Changan unveiled a $285m investment to make its first right-hand-drive vehicles outside China. And on May 6th Thai officials said that Hozon, another Chinese firm, will produce its mass-market NETA V electric model in Thailand.

In recent months a price war has broken out in China between EV marques. Many carmakers see foreign expansion as the surer route to growth. China exported $21bn-worth of cars in the first quarter of 2023, 82% more than in the same period last year.

Thailand, as an American ally and member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which loosens restrictions on trade in intermediate goods, looks particularly appealing.

Car sales in the region rose by 23% last year, to 3.4m. But the carmakers also have designs on the lucrative Western markets. Research by Allianz, a German insurer, finds that Chinese firms accounted for about 4% of battery-EV sales in Germany between January and March, three times the share a year earlier. Some, including BYD, are even attempting to conquer the American market, as Japanese firms had done before them (though sour relations between the two governments and America\u2019s protectionist subsidy regime for EVs complicate this effort)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whether or not the Chinese car companies\u2019 Thai plans succeed in their ultimate goal, the investments reinforce China\u2019s already dominant position in Asian supply chains. Last year Thailand received $3.4bn in foreign direct investment from companies in China (including Hong Kong), more than it did from America or Japan. Even among American allies like Thailand, the commercial benefits from closer ties to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy are too juicy to ignore. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 47}
