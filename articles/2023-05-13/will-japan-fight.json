At the base, which houses Japanese and American forces, pilots from the two countries practise flying together. The risk of war with China over Taiwan has made those preparations ever more urgent. Japan plans to double its defence budget by 2027 and acquire long-range missiles to make its Self-Defence Forces (SDF) fiercer. But it has not fired a shot in battle since 1945. Will Japan fight? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Geography puts Japan on the front line: its westernmost island sits 111km from Taiwan. Conflict is probably less likely if China believes Japan would join the fray. If war does break out, keeping Taiwan from falling may hinge on Japanese support and firepower. \u201cJapan is the linchpin,\u201d concluded a recent war game by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington. At a minimum, America would need to use its bases in Japan. And if Japan\u2019s forces engaged in combat, success would be far more likely. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "If a crisis around Taiwan were to occur, \u201cthere\u2019s no way Japan won\u2019t be involved,\u201d says Otsuka Taku, a lawmaker with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. In such a scenario, \u201cwe will fight with the US\u201d. Yet the extent of that involvement is less clear. Much like America, Japan maintains ambiguity over its potential role. Unlike America, Japan has no legal commitment to help Taiwan defend itself. Despite forceful talk from politicians, Japan\u2019s official policies towards the island have not changed. Interpreting its security-policy reforms \u201cto mean that Japan is all-in on a Taiwan fight\u201d is a mistake, says Christopher Johnstone, a former American security official. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a time of war, the alliance between America and Japan would face several tests. If America came to Taiwan\u2019s defence\u2014itself hardly a given\u2014it would need approval from Japan to use its bases there, which host 54,000 American troops. Would Japan accede? China might offer not to harm Japan if it refused. But America would remind Japan of the long-term consequences. \u201cIf we don\u2019t say yes, the alliance is over,\u201d says Kanehara Nobukatsu, a former Japanese official."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then Japan would have to decide whether to act itself. The Diet, Japan\u2019s parliament, would probably at least consider the situation to have \u201cimportant influence\u201d, a legal designation that authorises non-combat support, such as providing fuel, medical care and logistical assistance. Entering combat would be trickier. The SDF is allowed to use force if Japan itself is attacked. Those powers would be invoked if China fired missiles at American bases in Japan, or launched a simultaneous assault on the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, which Japan controls but China claims. A law passed in 2015 also permits the use of force if another country is attacked and the Diet deems it \u201csurvival-threatening\u201d for Japan. This construct makes it easy, with enough political will, to unshackle the sDF. Yet it also creates every opportunity not to. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Japan decided to fight, it would have to choose where and in what capacity. Japanese law limits any use of force to \u201cthe minimum extent necessary\u201d. Planners foresee Japan largely as the shield to America\u2019s spear\u2014defending its own territory and American bases, freeing America to take on China. \u201cJapan takes care of itself, and America defends Taiwan,\u201d says Kawano Katsutoshi, a former chief of Japan\u2019s joint staff. That might involve dispatching its diesel-powered submarines to choke points in the East China Sea. But it probably does not mean venturing into the Taiwan strait. Even so, Japanese and American forces would have to operate around each other, especially in the air, says Zack Cooper of the American Enterprise Institute, another think-tank in Washington."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The alliance between Japan and America was not designed for such fighting. Japan was seen less as a military partner than as a platform from which America could project power, as it did during wars in Korea and Vietnam. Unlike the NATO charter, which enshrines the principle of collective defence, the US-Japan Security treaty of 1960 obliges America to protect Japan in exchange for bases in the country, but not the other way around. Japanese and American troops have parallel chains of command. This is unlike America\u2019s alliance with South Korea, where the forces answer to a single combined command boasting the mantra \u201cfight tonight\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Being ready for a fight would require revamping the alliance\u2019s institutions. The lack of a combined American-Japanese command means that the forces answer to different sets of orders and follow different rules of engagement. Military units have found ways to work together. At Misawa, a rare example of a jointly used base, the two countries\u2019 pilots can sync up in the air. But if missiles fly, the two forces will need a way to sync their \u201csensors\u201d and \u201cshooters\u201d at scale. \u201cWe need more efficient and real-time situational awareness,\u201d says Isobe Koichi, a retired lieutenant-general."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Experts are searching for models. The Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, a think-tank, recently studied examples, including the command structure America and Britain used during the second world war and multinational counter-drug operations in the Caribbean. \u201cThe Americans and Japanese need to be working shoulder to shoulder, even if they don\u2019t have a combined command,\u201d says Jeffrey Hornung of the RAND Corporation, another think-tank. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Japan plans to create permanent joint headquarters, which are expected to serve as a counterpart to America\u2019s Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). Yet that may take years. America also needs to make changes: United States Forces Japan, the American headquarters in the country, is empowered to manage the alliance and keep troops ready, but has no real operational role. The American warfighting commanders are currently at iNDOPACOM, far away in Hawaii. It will be hard to co-ordinate with Japanese forces if Tokyo is under attack, and doubly so if America\u2019s own communications are mucked up. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And any proposed changes will confront political realities. Japan fears abandonment by America, but is wary of too much entanglement. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Kishida Fumio, has assured the Diet he is not considering sharing command authority, or transferring it to America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Polling finds robust support for the alliance in Japan. But the public remains opposed to a more active military role for the SDF. One survey offered respondents choices for how to react to a conflict between America and China: 27% said the SDF should not work with America at all; 56% said it should limit itself to rear-area support; and just 11% said Japan should fight alongside America. \u201cNo one knows the truth\u201d about how such choices would pan out, says Michishita Narushige of the National Institute for Defence Studies in Tokyo. If Japan and America are forced to find out, they will already have failed. \u25a0"}], "id": 15}
