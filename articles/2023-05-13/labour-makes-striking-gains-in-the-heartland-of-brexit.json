Anger at immigration and at austerity drove them first into the arms of Nigel Farage\u2019s UK Independence Party (UKIP), then its successor, the Brexit Party, and then its imitator in Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives. Along the way, they pushed Britain out of the EU. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ramsgate, in east Kent, is still blustery; the locals are still angry. But local elections held in much of England on May 4th sent this mood of insurrection in a surprising new direction.

The long realignment of Eurosceptic voters away from Labour is partially unwinding, says Robert Ford of the University of Manchester, who was among the first to spot UKIP\u2019s potential in this region a decade ago.

Reform UK, as the Brexit Party was renamed, also failed to make headway, winning just six councillors and averaging a mere 6% of the vote in wards that it contested. That is a sign of Tory success: a long march to the right on Europe has occupied the space UKIP operated in. But it is also a big problem. In previous general elections, the Tories secured victory by winning over voters who had turned to radical-right parties during local elections. That pool is much smaller now. The towns where the Brexit revolution started are showing the first signs that it may be at an end. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
