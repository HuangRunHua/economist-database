Then on January 2nd the Chinese cargo vessel switched off the transponder that reports its movements and disappeared. It was not seen again until early February, when it was spotted offloading cargo in Nampo, North Korea\u2019s main port. A month later it had a new name, the Kum Gang 1, and was flying a North Korean flag. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Between January and May this year North Korea\u2019s commercial fleet grew by 14 ships, according to the latest report by the UN panel of experts that is tasked with monitoring the sanctions regime placed on the country. Transferring vessels to North Korea is forbidden under it. Yet since 2020 the hermit kingdom has acquired 52 ships. The sanctions-busting they facilitate is a lifeline for the economically isolated country, in particular by connecting it to its main patron, China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The fleet had been shrinking, to about 200 ships in 2016. But several rounds of sanctions following a North Korean nuclear test in 2016 have made it more economically significant. After a long covid-19-instigated shutdown, North Korea\u2019s ports have reopened and trade with China, by far the country\u2019s largest trading partner, is approaching pre-pandemic levels. With fewer foreign ships entering North Korea\u2019s ports, its vessels have more responsibility for ferrying goods in and out."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Increased trade left North Korea needing new ships. China was willing to help. The UN panel found that ten of North Korea\u2019s recent acquisitions were previously Chinese-owned. Most return to China with North Korean goods\u2014the trade is mostly between Nampo in North Korea and Dalian, in China\u2019s Liaoning province. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many of the vessels import grain or fertiliser. They also bring in sanctioned goods, such as luxury cars. These are often transferred between ships on the high seas at night, with transponders switched off or transmitting a false location. Huge floating cranes are used to load containers from one vessel to another. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such smuggling brings in essential goods and revenue. North Korea is only permitted to import 500,000 barrels of refined oil a year, yet imports more illicitly. Much of it comes from criminal networks that smuggle subsidised Taiwanese oil\u2014North Korean tankers have recently been seen loitering in the Taiwan Strait. An authority that monitors shipping activity via satellite told the panel of experts that North Korea may have exceeded its annual import limit as early as April.

Though the pandemic curbed this trade, it is reported to have grown fourfold between the first quarter of 2022 and the same period this year.
