Without them you cannot marry, register to vote or get salaried jobs. Nor can you open a bank account, go to university or legally buy a SIM card. Walking around without papers can even get you arrested, a hangover from the colonial era when many African workers needed a special pass. Though that is legally dubious, few Kenyans, especially those without documentation, dare challenge the police. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an ID, you don\u2019t exist,\u201d says Mustafa Mahmoud of Namati, a group that campaigns for legal rights for the poor."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For most Kenyans, applying for an ID card is quite simple. A school leaving certificate and a copy of a parent\u2019s ID will usually do. Yet some ethnic groups have still faced discrimination when applying. If your forebears migrated to Kenya during British colonial rule, you were still officially deemed foreign at independence in 1963. Generations later, long after losing touch with your ethnic homeland, for instance if it is Somalia, the government would not recognise you as a Kenyan citizen. Thousands were left in a bureaucratic limbo. The un High Commissioner for Refugees (unhcr) reckons that 16,800 people in Kenya are stateless. But the true number is probably far higher.

Mr Kenyatta later made a similar offer to the Shona people, originally from Zimbabwe, and to a small community of Rwandans. His successor, William Ruto, said the Pemba, originally from an island north of Zanzibar, constituted \u201cone of the ethnic communities of Kenya\u201d.

For instance, ethnic Somalis and people of Nubian descent still face extra vetting when applying for IDs.

Some vetting committees ask people to prove that all of their grandparents were born in Kenya\u2014often an impossible task."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Things may, however, be improving. Most Nubians now eventually get an ID if they request one.
