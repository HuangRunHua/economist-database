The Kremlin is irritated by the country\u2019s recent overtures to America, Europe and Ukraine. Armenia says Russia has abandoned its pledge to protect it from Azerbaijan. In October, Nikol Pashinyan, the prime minister, accused Russia of trying to overthrow his government. Moscow did little to deny it: its state media quoted an anonymous high-ranking source accusing Mr Pashinyan of \u201cfollowing in the steps of [Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr] Zelensky\u201d.

But he tried to keep the Kremlin onside, even sending Armenian forces to co-operate with Russia\u2019s interventions in Syria and Kazakhstan. Relations nevertheless began to sour in 2020, when Russia stayed largely neutral while Azerbaijan bested Armenia in an attack on Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic-Armenian enclave. Still, after that war Russia sent 2,000 peacekeepers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Afterwards Azerbaijan carried out repeated incursions. That should have activated the mutual-defence provisions of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a Russia-led pact to which Armenia belongs. But Russia dithered. In September 2023 Azerbaijan launched a lightning offensive to capture the rest of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian authorities surrendered, nearly the entire population fled, and the Russians just watched."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As Russia failed to help, Armenia looked elsewhere. It used to buy nearly all its weapons from Russia. But lately it has signed deals for rockets and ammunition with India and for armoured vehicles and radars with France. In February it welcomed an EU border-monitoring mission. Mr Pashinyan seems determined to goad Russia. In September his wife personally delivered an aid package to Kyiv. In October the parliament ratified the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. Since the court has indicted Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, this requires Armenia to arrest him, if he seeks to visit."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some Armenians think Mr Pashinyan is going too far. \u201cI\u2019m arguing to be a little more prudent,\u201d says Richard Giragosian of the Regional Studies Centre, a think-tank in Yerevan, Armenia\u2019s capital. \u201cWe\u2019re poking the bear.\u201d But as long as the overtures to the West remain symbolic, Russia\u2019s responses will too, he argues. Mr Pashinyan rules out serious steps such as leaving the CSTO or expelling the Russian army from its base in Armenia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Armenia\u2019s room for manoeuvre is slim. Russia is its biggest trading partner by far and provides nearly all its grain and energy imports. Many Armenians depend on remittances from family members working in Russia.

America\u2019s credibility was hit when a State Department official told Congress that it would \u201cnot tolerate\u201d an attack on Nagorno-Karabakh, yet when Azerbaijan invaded five days later the American response was limited merely to critical statements. The head of the EU\u2019s monitoring mission in Armenia recently admitted that, in a war, the unarmed monitors would flee. \u201cThey cannot be human shields,\u201d said a Western diplomat in Yerevan.
