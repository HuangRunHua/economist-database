The number of bears in Montana has risen steadily while they have been protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), America\u2019s landmark wildlife-conservation law, which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2023. But their recovery has brought mixed feelings: pride, that a species once close to extinction in the lower 48 states is again thriving; anger, from those who feel that the bears threaten their way of life; and fear, because run-ins with the predators do not always end well for bears or for people. The bears\u2019 success has also reignited one of the longest-running battles in the American West: Republican states\u2019 ideological war against federal environmental regulations.

That of Gallatin County, which includes part of the GYE, grew by a whopping 35% in the same period. Greg Gianforte, the state\u2019s Republican governor, attributes some of the growth to the popularity of the hit television show \u201cYellowstone\u201d (a ranching drama) and the allure of wild places and remote work during the covid-19 pandemic. \u201cPeople move to the most beautiful places,\u201d he says. \u201cI personally think Montana is the most beautiful place.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Gianforte is a central character in this drama.

Past grizzly delistings have been challenged in the courts. The feds are also deciding whether grizzlies should be returned to Washington state. Beyond bears, Ms Doremus reckons the ESA will stay in the spotlight.

The feds think they should preside over the protection of lands and species important to the country. States resent federal environmental regulations as government overreach.

Yet Americans across the country feel the bear belongs to them, too.
