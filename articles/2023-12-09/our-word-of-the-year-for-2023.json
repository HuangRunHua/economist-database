It is a salutary reminder that the world is much bigger than the English language and that, even in largely English-speaking countries, the stock of words is constantly being refreshed by the languages with which English makes contact."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Our senior correspondent in Africa suggested coupas the word of the year\u2014there have been two successful ones there in 2023. But an honourable mention should go to the Yoruba verb japa, used colloquially in Nigeria to describe making a quick escape from a precarious situation. Recently it has been extended to mean escape from Nigeria itself, which is plagued by misgovernment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In contrast, India had a self-confident year, and vishwaguru was on many lips. As India hosted the G20 summit under the satisfied gaze of Narendra Modi, the prime minister, his fans revived the Sanskrit term. It means, roughly, \u201cteacher to the world\u201d (vishwa means \u201cworld\u201d, and guru has long been an Indian export). Indians using it feel they need no lessons from arrogant Westerners."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Or is that \u201cNortherners\u201d? The global south has gained ground as a way to talk about developing countries, especially those that used to be called \u201cthe third world\u201d. They avoid following America\u2019s line on issues like Ukraine or Gaza, though they may be wary of Russia and China, too. Talk of the global south has led more people to refer to the global north, which is mostly what used to be the West. These linguistic shifts make for all-encompassing confusion."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the global East, Johnson\u2019s colleagues highlight lan wei lou: Mandarin for rotten-tail building.

It came to prominence thanks to Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission.

This was the year of artificial intelligence (AI), and not any kind but generative , which can churn out text and images with only some simple prompts.

They produce prose so human-like that they have ignited a debate about whether LLMs are actually thinking (and whether students will ever do homework without them again)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Generativewould be the word of the year if it were more widely known and used beyond the experts who follow AI. But since its launch in 2022, one term in particular\u2014ChatGPT\u2014has been on the lips of everyone from journalists to cab drivers wondering what all the fuss is about.

And Google searches for \u201cChatGPT\u201d are more than 90 times as frequent as those for \u201cgenerative AI\u201d or \u201clarge language model\u201d. ChatGPT is the same in every language.
