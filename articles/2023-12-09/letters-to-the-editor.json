Carbon dioxide, once released into the atmosphere, has a warming effect that spans millennia, whereas even stratospheric particles fall out of the atmosphere after a year or two. That means that if one comes to rely on solar geoengineering to prevent a dangerous level of warming, one is committing humanity to maintaining the deployment flawlessly over untold future generations, lest a cessation in the process leads to a catastrophic rapid warming. And if deployment is used as an excuse to continue emitting carbon, which is a probable consequence of human nature, each year would require a greater degree of solar geoengineering, incurring an ever-increasing magnitude of potential termination shock.
