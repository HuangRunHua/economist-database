The assault blindsided Israel\u2019s spies, and seems to have surprised even Hamas\u2019s political leaders. But did someone know enough to profit?

In September an average of 1,581 shares a day of EIS were sold short, representing 17% of the daily total trading volume. On October 2nd, five days before the attacks, a whopping 227,820 shares were shorted, representing 99% of total volume. Rather than reflecting a souring of market sentiment, the increase in activity seems to have come from just two trades. Then, on the first trading day after the attack, standard \u201clong\u201d transactions outnumbered short sales by a similar number of shares (248,009). If these trades were made by the same investor, they would correspond to a $1m profit.

In contrast, the number of longer-dated options on such shares, whose value depended on events beyond mid-October, barely changed.

Yet no surge has occurred at the start of any other quarter since 2009. The authors say that had any large purchases of eis been made to offset the shorts, such transactions would appear in their data. Another objection is that although a big short sale should in theory drive down prices, eis actually rose in value. In response, the authors note that the fund\u2019s value is tied to the prices of the shares it contains, and that the shorts of EIS were tiny in comparison with the market capitalisation of the firms the fund tracks."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The study has prompted an inquiry by Israel\u2019s securities authority. Assigning motives to trading activity is always hard; the authors cannot rule out benign explanations. But they argue that the most plausible account is that whoever made the trades was familiar with Hamas\u2019s secrets. Although the millions of dollars in potential profits are small, Mr Mitts notes they are a lower limit identifiable with public data.
