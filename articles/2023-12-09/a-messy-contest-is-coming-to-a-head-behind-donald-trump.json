Donald Trump has been far ahead all year, and his lead has steadily lengthened. As our new poll tracker shows, the gap between the former president and his closest challenger, Ron DeSantis, Florida\u2019s governor, has grown from 14 percentage points to a seemingly unassailable 51 points. With Iowa\u2019s big night less than six weeks away, it looks all over bar the caucusing. And if he wins his party\u2019s nomination, Mr Trump would have a good chance of returning to the White House. Analysts at home and abroad are rightly starting to get their minds round what a second Trump term might mean."}, {"role": "body", "text": "However, just as in a horse race, the primaries\u2019 front-runner can stumble, or be tripped up by the voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. In Mr Trump\u2019s case, his legal troubles\u2014including four criminal trials and 91 felony charges\u2014could start to look like a threat in the general election. Concerns over candidates\u2019 ability to last the course have understandably centred on the 81-year-old, gaffe-prone President Joe Biden. But the more vigorous-looking Mr Trump is only four years younger and you cannot rule out that a health scare will afflict such a short-fused burger enthusiast. Momentum in politics can change, and a dead-cert can suddenly start losing ground."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231209_LDC665.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 468.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "For all these reasons, although the nomination looks like Mr Trump\u2019s to lose, it is worth keeping an eye on the race far behind him. Contenders have started to drop out, including Mike Pence, Mr Trump\u2019s former vice-president. A fresher face, Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur, managed a mini-spurt over the summer but has since fallen back. As the field narrows, it is becoming more interesting. Heading towards election year, the struggle to be Mr Trump\u2019s main challenger is between two credible candidates: Mr DeSantis and Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina who served as Mr Trump\u2019s ambassador to the UN."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Haley has been on something of a roll. In the absence of Mr Trump, she has stood out in candidate debates (calling Mr Ramaswamy \u201cscum\u201d in Miami last month), and predictably came under attack from the diminished field of just three rivals at the latest one on December 6th. \u201cI love all the attention, fellas,\u201d she said. She has won the endorsement of the wealthy political network founded by the Koch brothers. According to our poll tracker, she has risen to within one percentage point of Mr DeSantis, at 11% to the Florida governor\u2019s 12%. Betting markets suggest that she has already overtaken him, with on average a 13% chance of winning the nomination, compared with just 6% for the wooden, unconvincing Mr DeSantis. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "However, Florida\u2019s governor still has some running in him. His dismal form for most of the year has meant that his support has slumped by more than 20 points. But he mustered a combative performance in another recent televised debate, this time with Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California. And, intriguingly, our tracker shows him well ahead of Ms Haley in the polling of Republican voters\u2019 second preferences\u2014the candidate they would favour should Mr Trump drop out. Those polls suggest that, were that to happen, Mr DeSantis would pick up much of the former president\u2019s support, giving him more than double the backing of Ms Haley."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The tussle far behind Mr Trump looks like a sideshow, given his commanding lead. But if he falters, the Republican primary is not the only one that would suddenly become compelling. Mr Biden let slip at a fundraising event this week that \u201cIf Trump wasn\u2019t running, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be running.\u201d Rarely are presidential races so certain and so uncertain at the same time. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter examining the state of American democracy, and read other articles about the elections of 2024."}], "id": 6}
