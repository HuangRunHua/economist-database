But it could just as well be Joe Biden today. History has a way of repeating itself in the Middle East. War in Gaza has once again led to talk of peace, which may seem far-fetched, given the massacre of more than 1,200 Israelis on October 7th and the subsequent killing of some 16,000 Palestinians during the Israeli assault on Gaza. The Holy Land has not seen this much bloodshed since Israel was founded in 1948. Peace has never seemed so far away."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Biden hopes it will emerge nonetheless. \u201cWhen this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next, and in our view it has to be a two-state solution,\u201d he said in October. At a conference in Bahrain in November, one Arab official after another offered a similar message. \u201cWe need to go back to a two-state solution, to an Israeli and Palestinian state living side by side,\u201d said Anwar Gargash, an adviser to the president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some see such talk as a fig leaf, intended to dispel misgivings about Western support for Israel and Arab inaction amid a horrifying war. After all, the 30-year peace process between Israelis and Palestinians is littered with failures. A revival of negotiations would be doomed from the start without, at the very least, three essential changes. First is new leadership. The political parties on either side of the current war in Gaza are the same ones that laboured to spoil the nascent peace process 30 years ago; they must go. Next is an effort to make the negotiations credible: both sides are ever more doubtful about the other\u2019s sincerity. Last, both sides need incentives to make a deal. Palestinians need to feel that their state is viable, and Israelis need to feel that theirs will be secure."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The two-state solution has been around, in one form or another, for almost a century. The United Nations adopted a partition plan for Palestine in 1947 that would have created two states, one Arab and one Jewish, with international control of Jerusalem.

Then came the Oslo accords in 1993, which set a five-year deadline to create a Palestinian state and in the meantime established the Palestinian Authority (PA), a government of sorts, albeit with limited powers and jurisdiction over only part of the occupied territories. A string of failures followed: the summits at Camp David and Taba, the Bush administration\u2019s \u201croad map for peace\u201d, Mr Obama\u2019s diplomacy.

There would be a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank\u2014around 22% of the area of historic Palestine\u2014with its capital in east Jerusalem.

The hitch is that this solution requires big sacrifices from both sides. Israelis would have to give up land, while Palestinians would have to give up on much of the land they have lost since 1948.

His Likud party has adopted resolutions opposing Palestinian statehood. Kan, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster, reported in November that Mr Netanyahu met backbenchers from Likud to plead for his political survival. \u201cI am the only one who can prevent a Palestinian state in Gaza and Judea and Samaria after the war,\u201d he said, using the Hebrew name for the West Bank."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Mr Netanyahu\u2019s days are numbered.

He has said little about it in public. His party\u2019s official position is a woolly call for \u201cseparation from the Palestinians\u201d, without any detail on how this might be achieved. Sources close to Mr Gantz say he has no interest in being more specific. To do so, they say, would play into the hands of Mr Netanyahu.

The same goes for some of his prospective coalition partners\u2014and the Israeli public, which has swung to the right over the past few decades."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Palestinian politics look even more forbidding. A peace process is unthinkable with Hamas, which has spent three decades playing spoiler.

The UAE hopes to see a role for Muhammad Dahlan, a former Fatah security chief who has spent the past decade in exile in Abu Dhabi.

He often polls as the most popular Palestinian leader\u2014but that is mostly because he has spent decades out of the public eye, at a time when Fatah descended into corruption and senescence.

For Fatah to regain popularity, it would need to do two things. One is to curb its members\u2019 rampant graft (asked to name the most pressing problem for the PA to tackle, more Palestinians mention corruption than occupation). The other is to show that a non-violent approach can yield results. \u201cThey have to make Hamas ineffective,\u201d says Khalil Sayegh, a Palestinian academic from Gaza. \u201cPeople have to see that Hamas is not really doing anything good.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "That requires concessions from Israel, which points to a second question: how to make negotiations credible.

For Palestinians, they brought only deepening despair. \u201cThe whole project of an independent Palestinian state is becoming part of the past,\u201d says Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian minister.

It could shrink Area C, the two-thirds of the West Bank under full Israeli control, and expand Area B, where the PA has authority over civil matters, but not security. (Area A, where the PA has full control, is even smaller: see map.) It could stop demolishing unlicensed homes in Area C, where it refuses to grant Palestinians construction permits (it usually issues ten or fewer each year). It could curtail army raids in Palestinian cities."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For Palestinians, though, these steps would be woefully insufficient. A slightly expanded Area B would hardly be a resounding achievement that Fatah could sell to a dubious public. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited 30 years for a state,\u201d says a diplomat. \u201cWe don\u2019t want some construction permits.\u201d The Oslo accords, after all, were undone by gradualism: the idea that both sides needed to build trust with symbolic moves before agreeing on more substantive steps."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Asked what would constitute a more serious gesture, several Palestinian analysts point to the settlements in the occupied West Bank, home to around 465,000 Israelis. It would not be enough to freeze new construction, they say; that has been tried before, including under Mr Obama. Israel should go further and dismantle some of the settlements it would have to relinquish in a peace deal. That would both build confidence and advance a final-status agreement. It also seems politically impossible in Israel, especially after October 7th, since it would be seen as rewarding a massacre."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After decades of foot-dragging, Israel is unlikely to make any big gestures without pressure from America. \u201cUnless the Israeli system actually feels there\u2019s a cost for going in this direction, I don\u2019t see how you free up some space for different politics,\u201d says Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator.

Anyway, some of them cannot be banned: they are American citizens."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For an American squeeze on settlements to succeed, it would need to encompass the Israeli state, too. International law obliges the Israeli army to protect Palestinians in occupied territory, but it often stands by as settlers carry out attacks. If it continues to allow (and sometimes abet) such violence, America could threaten to cut military aid. That would be a clear signal, to the Palestinians and the Arab world, that America was serious about trying to play a less biased role. But such a threat is hard to imagine in an election year\u2014or if Donald Trump wins the presidency in 2024. If Mr Biden secures a second term, though, such a move would be popular with the progressive wing of his party."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Along with threats, America and its partners would also have to offer incentives. For the Palestinians, these would probably be mainly financial. The most immediate question is how to rebuild a shattered Gaza, the bill for which will easily run into tens of billions of dollars.

Ending conflict not only with the Palestinians but also with the entire region should be a powerful inducement."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At a meeting in Qatar earlier this month, the Gulf states talked about a plan for post-war Gaza.

Those negotiations too often become an end rather than a means, even though by now there is little left to negotiate: it has all been discussed ad infinitum.
