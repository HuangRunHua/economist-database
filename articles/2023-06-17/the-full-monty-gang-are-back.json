Gaz, their ringleader, played by Robert Carlyle, was an ex-con at risk of losing contact with his son. Overweight and depressed, his best pal Dave (Mark Addy) feared for his marriage. All six were adrift and emasculated in the post-industrial world. It was a hoot."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And not only because of the penis jokes and the fact that they got their kit off. Released in 1997, the film exemplified two winning genres. First, a tale in which a posse of misfits seek salvation in a shared endeavour\u2014a brass band, a choir\u2014as the clock ticks towards a showdown. Second, as \u201cRocky\u201d was to Philadelphia, \u201cThe Full Monty\u201d was a paean to an unlovely place that is loved nevertheless, in this case Sheffield, Yorkshire, in all its rusty glory: the sun rising behind the smokestacks, the polluted canals, derelict mills, grimy terraces, grey tower blocks and garden gnomes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was also a toe-tapping ode to the dance music of the Seventies and Eighties, from \u201cHot Stuff\u201d to \u201cYou Sexy Thing\u201d. (\u201cLook at that,\u201d Dave complained of Irene Cara\u2019s welding technique in the video for \u201cFlashdance\u201d, \u201cher mix is all to cock!\u201d) Coming out at a moment when British culture had clout, the film was an international hit. A quarter of a century on, the gang are back in an eight-part series of the same name, out on June 14th on Hulu in America and Disney+ elsewhere."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Seeing them after all these years is like meeting long-lost friends, albeit the kind who make you think: if that\u2019s what you look like, how the hell do I look? Life has continued to come at them, in the form of bereavement, adultery and loan sharks. Still skint, Gaz lives in a caravan and has a teenage daughter, Destiny, or Des (Talitha Wing, the best thing here). Like her old man, Des makes mistakes but tries to make up for them, struggles to go straight but has a heart of gold. The story is again anchored in Gaz\u2019s friendship with Dave and Dave\u2019s marriage to Jean (Lesley Sharp). She is now the head teacher of a school where Dave is the caretaker."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Closeted in the movie, Lomper (Steve Huison) has a husband and runs a caf\u00e9 that is the chums\u2019 hq. It is a homely version of the mobsters\u2019 meat-shop hangout in \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d, with less ultraviolence and more cake. The six wrestle with 21st-century mores such as automated supermarket checkouts and political correctness. Once again they get into harmless scrapes; again Gaz\u2019s children are father to the man. Along with the children come assorted animals (a stolen celebrity dog, a prize racing pigeon). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This sounds twee, and it is. At the same time the mood is much grimmer than the original\u2019s, and not only because everyone keeps their clothes on. The film had decay and despair but also the gentleness of a fable. Here, beneath the antics and confectionary, the wider world is desolate. The school\u2019s ceilings leak. Hospitals are creaking. The welfare system is a cruel obstacle course. People go hungry."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As a result, the tone whiplashes between doleful and cute, the comedy veering from whimsical to screwball to macabre. Dramatic tension suffers. For all the post-Thatcher political consciousness, the real battle in 1997 was between the six men and themselves. Several almost pulled out of the striptease because of their neuroses, psychological or anatomical. Baring all became, for them, a sort of gaudy apotheosis."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the new series, the antagonist is the pitiless, skinflint state, a foe you can dodge and bait but not defeat. The clock the men race is the tick-tock of mortality. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s another day. Might be shit too,\u201d Gaz tells Des, expressing the limit of the drama\u2019s optimism, \u201cbut at least shit in a different way.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As for the thongs and Velcro-seamed trousers: this show knows it can\u2019t dance in the same dole queue twice, and doesn\u2019t try to. Nods to the gyrations of yore are sparing; only one scene comes close to reprising the old routine, and then in circumstances bleak enough for Beckett. Instead it updates and amplifies the politics and deepens the characters."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Does it work? It grows on you. And there is a brave kind of integrity in this approach to making a sequel. Most sequels run on nostalgia, peddling the dual pleasures of a gauzily revisited past and a sense of progress and resolution. Boldly, \u201cThe Full Monty\u201d offers little of either. The past is past and, even with the crutches of friendship and gallows humour, the present is scarcely a remedy.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:The comic opera of England (May 28th)What happens when a story loses a main character?
