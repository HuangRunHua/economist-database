And how to win if one breaks out? As American strategists turn to the map, one school argues for holding the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d that girdles China, from Japan to Malaysia; others prefer to draw the line at the second chain, which runs from Japan to New Guinea. The first is populous and important economically but also vulnerable, lying well within the \u201cweapons engagement zone\u201d of many Chinese missiles; the second is safer and offers more certain access\u2014including American outposts such as Guam. To judge from a flurry of moves by America and its allies, the answer is: redouble the defences of the first chain, but also strengthen the second."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In defence terms, America\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d is not a single move, but a weaving of initiatives\u2014with overlapping bi-, tri-, quadri- and multilateral deals\u2014to create an ever-thickening lattice on China\u2019s periphery. Some deals are modest; many are uncertain if tested in war. But they amount to the \u201cfortification of America\u2019s forward defence perimeter in the western Pacific\u201d, says a senior American defence official.

But the second world war changed their perspective, says Michael Green of the United States Study Centre in Sydney. The attack on Pearl Harbour showed that vast distances do not guarantee safety; America\u2019s island-hopping campaign highlighted the importance of north-south axes. Later on, the first island chain helped America contain the Soviet Union. Now it holds back China. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To see how, begin with the northernmost link, Japan. Despite its pacifism, it is greatly boosting defence spending. American marines in Okinawa are practising how to scatter and defend the islands and sea passages. The next link, Taiwan, is under intense strain, given China\u2019s aim to retake the self-governing island by force if necessary. America may soon announce the first \u201cdrawdown\u201d of weapons from its own arsenal, pre-emptively strengthening Taiwan much as it has armed Ukraine. The Philippines, the next link, is weaker but has agreed to give America access to nine bases in the country; in return America is helping to beef up its forces. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the second chain, meanwhile, America is devising ways to disperse its jets in wartime and hardening the defences of Guam. It wants to project more power from Australia, where it rotates air force and marine units. It is working with Britain to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia under the AUKUS deal; the three are also working on new weapons, including hypersonic missiles. Farther afield, the Quad\u2014America, Australia and Japan working with India\u2014is not a formal security grouping, but their navies exercise together. Across the region, American-led war-games are becoming bigger and more sophisticated. Sometimes America\u2019s security arrangements are limited, for instance its new defence deal with Papua New Guinea; or its efforts to help littoral states improve \u201cmaritime domain awareness\u201d to, say, curb illegal fishing by Chinese fleets. This, too, helps enmesh America in the region."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Travelling across Asia on an E4-B, the flying command post of Lloyd Austin, America\u2019s defence secretary, brings alive this web-weaving strategy.

America\u2019s friends and allies in the \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d have no mutual-defence commitments akin to NATO\u2019s Article 5, under which an attack on one is an attack on all, nor integrated multinational commands.
