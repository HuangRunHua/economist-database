To be sliced and slivered and bathed in boiling oil before emerging as a French fry? To have its weight matched in butter and cream and be transformed into glorious mounds of mash? No. The answer is found in a plastic bag. For a potato, there is no nobler fate than to end up in a packet of Tayto cheese-and-onion crisps."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Taytos are the consummate crisps (potato chips to Americans). The company was established in Ireland in 1954 by Joe \u201cSpud\u201d Murphy. He was not the inventor of crisps, but he has been credited with transforming them. Until then there was no way to flavour the individual crisps themselves; instead each bag came with a small blue packet of salt to be sprinkled and shaken over the contents."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The invention after the second world war of the gas chromatograph dispensed with that DIY process. It allowed food scientists to understand the chemical compounds behind flavours such as cheese. That in turn led to the development of artificial flavours, an advance on which Murphy seized to great effect."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He started with cheese and onion. The pairing is a classic: think of the strings of Gruy\u00e8re emerging from a bowl of French onion soup, or a dish of K\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle, German dumplings that are mixed with cheese and topped with caramelised onions. And the flavour combines well with spuds. Potatoes, wrote Seamus Heaney, one of Ireland\u2019s greatest poets, promise the \u201ctaste of ground and root\u201d. The less poetic might describe them as a bit bland. Sprinkled with the salty, savoury umami of Murphy\u2019s seasoning, however, they became a cut-price sensation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Taytos remain the quintessential Irish crisp, but now they are available elsewhere (as, of course, are many other brands of flavoured crisps). That is a mixed blessing. Once upon a time even industrially produced foods had a limited range. To travel was to discover not only the cooking in other places, but the snacks. Going to France was a chance to chug a bulbous bottle of Orangina, a fizzy drink. For Europeans, a trip to America\u2014or a visit from Americans\u2014was an opportunity to stock up on Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups. Thanks to a globalised food system and the appetites of homesick migrants, such items are now available far beyond their lands of origin."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That shift entails the loss of a modest joy. At first glance a bag of Taytos is the antithesis of a seasonal or local food, characteristics that today are prized. Encased in their silvery plastic, they survive in all seasons and locales. And yet, for your columnist at least, these potato snacks are entangled with their Irish roots."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For her, Taytos are a once-a-year treat, to be eaten on a beach in south-west Ireland shivering after an icy swim or sweating at the top of a mountain. That is not out of necessity. They can be bought in London, her home city, or ordered on the internet, albeit at a mark-up. The ingenious seasoning should taste no different in a London park than in Murphy\u2019s homeland. But somehow it does. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 65}
