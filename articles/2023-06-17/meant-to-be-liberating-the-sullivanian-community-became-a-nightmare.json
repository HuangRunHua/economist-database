As Alexander Stille shows in this absorbing account of the group\u2019s rise and fall, many of its alumni do indeed remain in close contact with each other. But others regard it as a failed utopia or even \u201cthe most traumatic experience of their lives\u201d. One interviewee tells Mr Stille, whose previous books have covered his own parents\u2019 marital woes and the Sicilian Mafia, that he \u201cjoined a movement that turned into a business, that became a racket\u201d. Another describes the Sullivanians\u2019 driving force, Saul Newton, as \u201ca sexual monster\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Sullivan Institute for Research in Psychoanalysis was named after Harry Stack Sullivan, a psychiatrist who was heavily influenced by the work of Sigmund Freud. Isolated as a child, Sullivan took a keen professional interest in the problem of loneliness\u2014and in its antidote, which he called \u201cchumship\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1957 Newton and his wife, Jane Pearce, both followers of Sullivan, founded a centre that would expand on the radical implications of his ideas. Then a highly regarded therapist, Pearce shaped the group\u2019s theoretical framework and gave it credibility. Meanwhile Newton, who liked to brag about his exploits fighting fascists in the Spanish civil war, lent it his charisma. Together they acquired a handsome town house on the Upper West Side and built a summer retreat on Long Island."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Newton and Pearce believed that the nuclear family was an instrument of \u201cdeadening conformity\u201d, which trapped children and stifled parents. Instead they favoured \u201cgroup marriage\u201d, a mode of polyamory that allowed adults to luxuriate among \u201calternate validators\u201d, while their offspring were brought up by baby-sitters or sent away to boarding schools."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At first the Sullivanian community prized creativity. Notable patients included the artist Jackson Pollock, Lucinda Childs, a choreographer, and Clement Greenberg, an art critic who championed Abstract Expressionism. In the mid-1970s the focus narrowed: its main artistic channel became the Fourth Wall Repertory Company, which staged shows such as \u201cThe King of the Entire World\u201d, a musical which appeared to shed light on Newton\u2019s autocratic mindset."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many of those who took part in Sullivanian therapy, and especially the men, were drawn by the prospect of easy sex. But this was not a zone of unfettered hedonism. Rules abounded. These extended to food, prompting one member, who had been required to travel to a conference in Indiana with provisions from New York, to contemplate his wilting salami and reflect: \u201cI don\u2019t think Armageddon is going to happen if we have a cheeseburger.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rigid codes were supposed to foster closeness. Yet what to some members seemed the atmosphere of a tight-knit village struck others as a grotesque culture of surveillance. The leaders purported to be communists but revelled in hierarchical privilege. As disciples fretted about status and earning \u201cprestige points\u201d, Newton\u2014who was divorced from Pearce in the early 1970s and married six times in all\u2014ran amok. (A serial predator, he demanded sexual favours from a woman who had very recently given birth.) He died in 1991, aged 85; in his declining years his appetites became violent and abusive.

The author is sensitive to the human cost of this experiment, even if occasionally his language is rather breezy (one character goes on a \u201cwild paternity rollercoaster\u201d; the state of mind of others is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d). He elicits zinging critiques from his sources\u2014not least one of Newton\u2019s daughters, Esther, who remarks that her father\u2019s project \u201ccombined the worst of Marxism, psychoanalysis and the musical theatre\u201d. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 66}
