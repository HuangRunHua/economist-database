On June 12th the basketball contest crowned a small-city team that had never before won a championship, the Denver Nuggets. They defeated an unlikely challenger in the Miami Heat, the last-seeded team in its conference of eight. Had Miami won, that would have been a first for such a lowly side. Meanwhile, the UEFA Champions League final, held on June 10th, featured a powerhouse from Britain, Manchester City, defeating a mainstay of European football, Italy\u2019s Inter Milan. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "European and British football leagues generally let teams spend as much as they want on players, as long as they do not lose too much money. More successful sides tend to earn more money, and so have more cash to splurge on star players\u2014which in turn translates into more success on the pitch, and so on. The week before its Champions League triumph, Man City snatched the English FA Cup, beating Manchester United, another deep-pocketed team. Man United and Man City have won 20 out of the past 31 English Premier League titles; the Champions League (or its predecessor, the European Cup) has been won by Real Madrid and AC Milan, Inter\u2019s arch-rival, 21 out of 68 times. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Across the Atlantic, meanwhile, the sports world\u2019s most lucrative competition, the National Football League (NFL, which involves the non-soccer variety) has a hard salary cap, leading to more parity among teams. The top two squads have won only 12 of 56 Super Bowls, the annual tournament\u2019s final round. The penalty for breaking the NBA\u2019s current $124m salary cap was bumped up in 2011 and again this year in a revenue-sharing deal negotiated between the players\u2019 union and owners. \u201cThe new deal is basically trying to prevent superteams,\u201d says Brian Windhorst of ESPN, a television network. And it seems to be working. The Economist\u2019s analysis of NBA data shows that a broader set of teams have indeed made it to the playoffs in recent history. In the five years to 2023, 29 of the NBA\u2019s 30 squads made the league\u2019s knockout stage at least once (the Charlotte Hornets are the exception). That has not happened since the five years to 2008, itself an unusually competitive period."}, {"role": "body", "text": "American sporting socialism, then, appears to lead to more competitive contests than Europe\u2019s winner-takes-all approach. But do more competitive leagues make for better business? Here the evidence is mixed. On the one hand, unpredictability may drive interest\u2014why watch when you know who will win? The possibility of an underdog\u2019s success might help small teams develop devoted fan bases. On the other hand, people love a winner. Mr Windhorst notes that seasons in which big-name teams like the Boston Celtics have dominated were some of the NBA\u2019s most money-making years. In 2022, when the finals pitted the Celtics against San Francisco\u2019s Golden State Warriors, another star team, the league raked in record revenues of $10bn.

Unlike European football, where teams can be promoted or relegated across various tiers of leagues, American sports tend to be \u201cclosed\u201d\u2014there is no way for new teams to accede to the top tournament. \u201cThe Europeans see this as fundamental to the organisation of team sports,\u201d explains Stefan Szymanski of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Count all the tiers, and more than 1,000 clubs across Europe hope to compete in the Champions League. The NBA\u2019s 30 or the NFL\u2019s 32 make for more concentrated markets. And concentration leads to riches. (That explains why the threat of a breakaway league of elite teams hangs over European football.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last year the NFL\u2019s revenues reached $19bn, nearly three times as much as the English Premier League, which probably boasts more fans worldwide than all the American sports put together (see chart). As a result, American teams, which partake in the bonanza, fetch higher valuations. Over the past decade the value of the average NFL and NBA teams has grown by more than 300% and 600%, respectively, compared with a rise of 170% for America\u2019s booming stockmarket. A willingness to sacrifice profits for participation makes Europe\u2019s sport look European, after all. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 49}
