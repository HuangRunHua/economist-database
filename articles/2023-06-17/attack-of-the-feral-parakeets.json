No matter what his team does to stop them from building nests, the monk parakeets prevail. The birds will find the smallest gap, as teeny as a quarter of an inch (6mm), and insert a twig. \u201cThey will literally build off a twig and build their nests,\u201d says Mr Stalzer, an environment specialist. \u201cWe should hire them as engineers.\u201d The nests can be ten feet (three metres) in diameter , apartment buildings for the feathered set. When the birds expand their nests around electrical equipment, which keeps them warm, they can cause power cuts and sometimes fires. Since May 2021 they have knocked out power for 41,000 customers on Long Island.

Birds now breed in more than 20 states, including cold spots like Chicago. Stephen Pruett-Jones, a professor of ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago, says most of the colonies in America are probably descendants of escaped or released pets (another theory, almost certainly not true, is that the wife of a pet-shop owner released all the pet parakeets after a bitter divorce).

In general, though, cuteness is an excellent survival strategy in the Anthropocene. PSEG does not destroy nests during nesting season. A lawmaker in New York introduced a bill to give monk parakeets protected status. Before the pandemic Stephen Baldwin gave parakeet safari tours in Brooklyn. Bird-watchers trek to Green-Wood Cemetery to see the nests built atop its Gothic Revival entryway.
