The empirical evidence does not support this claim. Most speakers of English as a second language have an elementary or intermediate knowledge of it that is by no means comparable with that of native speakers. A study for the European Parliament that I co-wrote shows that only 11% of adults of working age in the EU claim to know English very well, far less than the 40% claimed by Johnson."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Native Anglophones hold the \u201cmonopoly of legitimate competence\u201d, to paraphrase Max Weber.

ELF (English as a lingua franca) is not accepted."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The economic and symbolic advantages for native Anglophones are immense, and this raises a problem of global linguistic justice that should be tackled, for example, through a language tax, or by reducing the extent of the legal protection of copyrights and patents published in English.
