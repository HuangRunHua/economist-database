A multitude went to Britain, which was facing acute labour shortages. They worked in tough places, such as textile mills and other industrial outfits. Many Indians whose families had moved to eastern Africa in the colonial period as indentured labourers later went west, too. America managed to attract a host of talented individuals by overhauling its immigration laws in 1965.

There are fewer bosses of Chinese descent running s&p 500 companies than there are bosses of Indian descent.

Under Mr Modi, India\u2019s ties to the West have been tested. Reasserting its status as a non-aligned power, India has refused to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and stocked up on cheap Russian oil and fertiliser.
