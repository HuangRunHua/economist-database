Poland\u2019s tumultuous history and polarised politics give its writers a lot to reflect on and disagree about. For more than a century from the late 1700s the country was partitioned by its neighbours, including Russia, Prussia and Austria. After the second world war it was subjugated by the Soviet Union. Many writers sought literary escape from the grimness of communism, through science fiction and reportage from far-off lands. Their tales were often coded satires of the Soviet-imposed system, which managed to escape censorship. Contemporary Poland sees itself as a Western country, anchored in NATO and the European Union, but its government does not always abide by the democratic norms of its allies. Here are six books about a country that is at once at the heart of Europe and on its edge."}, {"role": "body", "text": "God\u2019s Playground: A History of Poland (Two Volumes). By Norman Davies.

In the 17th century, as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, it covered more territory than any other European state west of Russia (and was more than triple its current size). By the end of the 18th it had ceased to be an independent entity. Poland became a battle zone in the two world wars and was then forced by the Soviet Union to become a socialist dictatorship. Norman Davies, the leading chronicler of Poland in English, squeezes 1,000 years of history into two volumes (and further compressed all that into a separate single-volume work, \u201cHeart of Europe\u201d). His book weds a British historian\u2019s detachment to the passion of a naturalised Pole, and weaves through its account of Poland\u2019s identity the heritage and influence of Jews, Germans, Ukrainians and Lithuanians. Mr Davies enriches his chronicle of events with anecdotes, poetry and retellings of the myths that have shaped Poland\u2019s character. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Twilight of Democracy.

On New Year\u2019s Eve the American-born journalist and her husband, Radoslaw Sikorski, who later became Poland\u2019s defence minister and foreign minister, gathered friends at their manor house. The air was crisp with optimism. After decades behind the Iron Curtain Poland had joined NATO and was in the EU\u2019s waiting room. But during the following 20 years the camaraderie crumbled. United by their rejoicing in the collapse of communism, the guests split into liberal and populist-conservative camps. The latter, represented by the Law and Justice party (PiS), is now in power. Over the past eight years it has weakened Poland\u2019s hard-won democracy by packing courts and public media with party loyalists. Other post-communist countries, notably Hungary, experienced similar developments."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In \u201cTwilight of Democracy\u201d, which was published soon after the re-election of the PiS government in 2019, Ms Applebaum, a former correspondent for The Economist, traces how intellectuals\u2014frustrated, self-pitying and opportunistic, in her description\u2014became agents of populism.

In \u201cThe Light That Failed\u201d, Ivan Kratsev, a Bulgarian academic, and Stephen Holmes, an American one, argue that eastern Europeans resent being cast as imitators of the progressive West.

A crew of scientists in a cramped space station in orbit above a sentient undulating organism slowly lose their grip on reality. What takes its place are painful memories. Lem thought that much of British and American science fiction was intellectually shallow. Their protagonists tend to explore alien worlds that become comprehensible; Lem imagined worlds that remain fundamentally mysterious. His novels send readers on psychological and philosophical journeys. And, as was common practice for independent-minded writers during the years of Soviet domination, Lem found ways to dodge censorship.
