The Bank of England intervened to steady markets, and Ms Truss sacked her chancellor and closest ally, Kwasi Kwarteng, on October 14th, before resigning herself six days later. Ms Truss\u2019s 49 days in office were the briefest of any prime minister. Although economic orthodoxy has now been restored by Rishi Sunak\u2019s government, is Britain still paying a \u201cmoron risk premium\u201d\u2014a term coined by Dario Perkins of TS Lombard, a research firm\u2014for Ms Truss\u2019s misadventure?"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230923_BRC672.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The bond market has provided mixed signals. After the yield on ten-year gilts peaked at 4.5% last September, it fell to 3.0% by the beginning of 2023. But it now stands at 4.3%. The main reason is that inflation has proved stickier than expected, so the bank\u2019s policy rate has increased faster and will stay higher for longer\u2014exactly as investors feared it would after Ms Truss\u2019s tax cuts. The bank has also been selling bonds, which in combination with continued debt issuance by the government may have further pushed up yields."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So why all the fuss a year ago? The telltale sign of investor panic was the combination of rising rate expectations and a crashing currency. Under normal conditions high rates should entice investors to buy sterling, not shun it.

The pound is 20% higher against the dollar than at its nadir on September 26th 2022."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For a better sense of whether a risk premium persists, look instead at credit-default swaps. These instruments insure investors in the event that the bond-issuer goes bust, so give a clearer indication of financial competence. Last September the price of insuring British government debt against default for five years rose from 29 basis points to 49 basis points after Ms Truss\u2019s growth plan was unveiled. Today, that instrument trades once more at 29 basis points."}, {"role": "body", "text": "While financial order appears to have been restored, the Conservative Party is still reeling. The Tories\u2019 deficit to Labour is close to 20 points in the polls. The party\u2019s reputation for economic competence has been shattered, too. Ms Truss shows little contrition. On September 18th she told the Institute for Government, a think-tank, that her regret was moving too quickly, not executing the plan itself. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
