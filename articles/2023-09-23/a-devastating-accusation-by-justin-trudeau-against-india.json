They fled through a park and disappeared."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On September 18th Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, told lawmakers in Ottawa that \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d from the country\u2019s security services linked India to the killing. It is a highly unusual accusation for the leader of one democracy to make against the government of another. Mr Trudeau said that he had discussed the allegation with Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Delhi on September 10th, and that he would push India to co-operate with an investigation. \u201cAny involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty,\u201d he told Parliament. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The accusation marks a new low in the already frosty relationship between the two countries. Shortly after Mr Trudeau\u2019s remarks, Canada\u2019s foreign minister announced the expulsion of the head of India\u2019s intelligence agency in Canada.India\u2019s foreign ministry categorically denied the \u201cabsurd\u201d allegation, and said Canada had shared no evidence for the damaging claim with India. It also announced the reciprocal expulsion of a Canadian diplomat and a suspension of visa issuance in Canada. It accused Canada of sheltering \u201cKhalistani terrorists and separatists\u201d, a reference to those who seek an independent homeland for Sikhs in the state of Punjab and other parts of northern India."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In India, the public reaction to Mr Trudeau\u2019s speech broadly echoed the government\u2019s line. A spokesman for the main opposition Congress party declared that India must be \u201cuncompromising\u201d in fighting terrorism. Several editorials highlighted Canada\u2019s alleged failures in tackling Sikh extremism and accused Mr Trudeau of pandering to terrorists. Some supporters of Mr Modi also predicted that the row would help the prime minister. \u201cJustin Trudeau starts campaigning for Modi ahead of the 2024 General Elections by blaming his govt of neutralising a terrorist on Canadian soil,\u201d Nupur J. Sharma, the editor of OpIndia, a right-wing website, wrote on X (formerly Twitter)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A deterioration in India-Canada ties had been apparent for some time. On September 1st Canada said it had paused trade talks with India. In the days leading up to the G20 Canada, while doggedly raising its allegation, apparently tried to reduce tensions by quietly sending the head of its intelligence service and Mr Trudeau\u2019s national security adviser to India. It did not help. At the G20 summit in Delhi, where other Western leaders held long meetings with Mr Modi, Mr Trudeau was fobbed off with a ten-minute huddle on the sidelines. A smiling Mr Modi draped a silk scarf round Mr Trudeau\u2019s neck in what now looks like an ironic welcome. Mr Modi later accused Canada of allowing India\u2019s enemies to promote secession and incite violence against Indians in Canada. (A previous trip by Mr Trudeau to India in 2018 turned into a fiasco after a convicted Sikh extremist was invited to a reception for him at the Canadian High Commissioner\u2019s residence; the invitation was later withdrawn.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sikh separatism, the cause behind a bloody insurgency in India in the 1980s and early 1990s, has long been a sore point between India and Canada, which has a large Sikh diaspora. India accuses Canada of being soft on militant separatists. Former Canadian security officials say India\u2019s government has conducted surveillance on Khalistani groups in Canada for years. Canada itself became the victim of Khalistani terrorism in 1985, when a bomb blew up an Air India aeroplane flying from Montreal to London, killing 329 people, mostly Canadians. It remains the deadliest terrorist attack against Canada in history. Just one suspect was convicted in connection with the bombing; another was shot dead in his car last summer, in the same city where Mr Nijjar was killed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The plane bombing has in no way soured relations between the 770,000 Sikhs living in Canada and their fellow Canadians. An important political constituency, Sikhs are courted by all Canadian parties. Canada insists it has cracked down on the small minority who have brought their fight for Khalistan to the country. Mr Nijjar had been a vocal advocate for an independent Khalistan, but he denied involvement in violence.

Canadian investors have become more important in India as they seek to profit from its high-growth economy: CPP Investments, a giant Canadian national savings fund, has some $20bn invested in the subcontinent.

The prime minister said that Canada, a member of the Anglophone \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence alliance, was \u201cclosely co-ordinating\u201d with allies on the matter. On September 18th America\u2019s National Security Council duly released a supportive statement, saying it was \u201cdeeply concerned about the allegations referenced by Prime Minister Trudeau\u201d and urged India to co-operate with the Canadian investigation. Britain and Australia, which have both had recent run-ins with India over the activities of Sikh separatists on their soil, issued similar statements. All three countries are courting India as a potential hedge against Chinese domination in Asia, and are painfully reluctant to antagonise it. Yet Mr Trudeau\u2019s public airing of the allegation, based on evidence that they will have seen, gave them little choice."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Mr Trudeau\u2019s allegation is correct, the assassination points towards an activist turn in the operations of India\u2019s intelligence services in the West, not least the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India\u2019s foreign-intelligence arm, the likeliest candidate for such an operation. Carved out of the domestic Intelligence Bureau in 1968, reputedly with help from the CIA, RAW has focused mainly on gathering intelligence on, and conducting operations in, Pakistan, China and other neighbours of India. It has been suspected of conducting black operations to influence India\u2019s neighbours, and to arrest and sometimes to kill its foes. But it is hard to find a precedent for such a seemingly overt attack in the West. It would have been \u201cmadness to perpetrate an act like this in a Five Eyes country\u201d, says a European former intelligence official."}, {"role": "body", "text": "India may hope to emulate Israel\u2019s Mossad, whose famously long arm strikes foes far away. But it risks being classed with Russia, whose murders abroad have provoked widespread condemnation and Western sanctions. If the allegations are correct, RAW may have spotted a chance to get rid of a troublesome separatist in Canada and send a message to others like him. But the killing seems more likely to inflame than quell the Khalistanis\u2014while forcing India\u2019s Western allies to ponder how benign a global power it really is. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Clarification (September 21st 2023): This piece has been edited to provide further details of India\u2019s response to the allegation."}], "id": 15}
