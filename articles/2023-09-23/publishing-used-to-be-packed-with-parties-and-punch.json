By Thomas Harding. Pegasus Books; 336 pages; $25.95. W&amp;N; \u00a325"}, {"role": "body", "text": "George Orwell\u2019s wife was a nasty snitch. The launch party for \u201cLolita\u201d was nearly a flop when censors threatened to spoil the fun. Saul Bellow was a needy fusspot. Mick Jagger could not tell a story. The biologist James Watson could, but he expressed such misogyny that readers, even in the 1960s, were alarmed. The anecdotes pile up in a new biography of George Weidenfeld (pictured), the founder of Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, a publisher. Isaiah Berlin was tricky; Henry Kissinger was a loyal friend; the historian Antonia Fraser was succulently beautiful. The Mitford sisters, naturally, were ghastly. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most editors fall broadly into two types: those who love the printing press and those who love pressing the flesh. The former are inky-fingered introverts for whom high drama is a fight over fonts. Weidenfeld was firmly in the latter camp. He was an impresario rather than an artisan; writing bored him. He lunched with Orwell, befriended Berlin and advised Vita Sackville-West\u2019s son, Nigel Nicolson, on how to seduce a woman: foreplay helped, he advised, as did the right amount of booze. Yet, throughout this book, which is less a biography than an anthology of encounters with the famous, Weidenfeld remains something of an enigma."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today, like Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s or Marks &amp; Spencer, Weidenfeld is better remembered as the name on one side of an ampersand than as a man. This is a pity, as he was fascinating in many ways. He lived in a time when the giants of publishing\u2014Allen Lane, Max Schuster, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch\u2014were not merely names on spines but people with them. Weidenfeld had more backbone than most, publishing everything from Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d, to the eccentric \u201cHitler\u2019s Table Talk\u201d (a collection of the F\u00fchrer\u2019s monologues), to Harold Wilson\u2019s analysis of the coal industry, \u201cNew Deal for Coal\u201d (a brave literary decision if ever there was one). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "His life was courageous, too. Weidenfeld, who was Jewish, fled Germany in 1938, arriving in Britain vaguely determined to \u201cbe a success\u201d. He swiftly became one. After a short spell working for the BBC, he wrote a book about Nazi propaganda. Then, having decided (rightly) that writing books was not much fun, he chose to publish them instead. He teamed up with Nicolson, founded a publishing house and was soon meeting\u2014and, in some cases, making\u2014many of the most famous names of 20th-century literature. Not that they were always grateful. Berlin likened talking to Weidenfeld to going to a brothel (fun but grubby) and wondered if he had a \u201ctotal absence of a moral centre\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Did he? The reader struggles to know. For all the detail in this book, and there is a lot, Weidenfeld himself remains elusive. Readers learn what he drank (milk); what he wore to bed (pyjamas); the texture of his hands (\u201cpodgy\u201d); how many times he was married (four). They also learn about parties where the air was heavy with cigar smoke, tainted with a pungent whiff of sexism and anti-Semitism. What readers do not learn, despite the detail, is the texture of Weidenfeld\u2019s mind. Or perhaps it is because of the detail, for there is too much: the reader does not need to know, for example, that someone called Cyril \u201cwas beset by fibroids\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "However, this book has two subjects: Weidenfeld and his world. If, as the biography of a man, it does not quite work, as the biography of an era\u2014the smoky, scurrilous world of post-war publishing\u2014it does. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 64}
