On the one hand, they welcome the economic growth that comes with agricultural expansion. On the other, they worry about its environmental cost and its political implications.

He told the website that he left as soon as the vandalism began.) In response to the census, Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court in August ordered the first reapportionment of seats in the lower house of Congress since 1993.

During the election campaign he proposed limiting beef exports to hold down domestic prices.

On June 27th he announced 364bn reais of subsidised loans to farmers, Brazil\u2019s biggest-ever agricultural-credit plan. Farmers who use renewable energy and non-chemical pesticides will qualify for the cheapest loans. The national development bank, set up in the 1950s to promote industry, is shifting towards financing agriculture. In 2009 agri-business received just 5% of the bank\u2019s loans. Last year nearly a quarter of its financing went to agriculture, and less than a fifth to industry. The balance is unlikely to shift back under Lula\u2019s government.

They oppose, and sometimes flout, the national forest code, which obliges farmers in the cerrado to maintain native vegetation on 20-35% of their land.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Brazil is one of the few countries where farmland is still expanding. The us Department of Agriculture estimates that by 2031 another 20m hectares, close to a quarter of the area now planted with crops, will be brought into production. Growth need not mean destroying trees. Some 170m hectares of pasture are thought to be under-used. If farmers grew soyabeans on just 10m of those hectares, they could raise output by 40m tonnes a year over the next decade, roughly a tenth of today\u2019s global output, says Daniel Amaral of the Association of Brazilian Vegetable Oil Industries. The productivity of each hectare could also increase. Brazilian maize farmers grow an average of six metric tonnes per hectare, half the yields American farmers achieve. Better infrastructure could boost profits and investment. The lorries that carry Mato Grosso\u2019s grains to port must travel along a single 1,000km pothole-filled road.
