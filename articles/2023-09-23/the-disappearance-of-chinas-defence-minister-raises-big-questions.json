What does that say about his judgment?", "hashTag": "China", "authorName": "The Economist", "publishDate": "2023-09-20T19:13:43Z", "contents": [{"role": "body", "text": "An ability to groom talented officials, China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, once said, \u201clargely determines the rise and fall, as well as the survival or demise\u201d of political parties and countries. After a sweeping reshuffle of ministerial posts in March, the government\u2019s main news agency, Xinhua, recalled Mr Xi\u2019s words in an article aimed at showing how meticulous the selection process had been. Since late June, however, two of the most senior officials who were promoted in that shake-up have disappeared: first Qin Gang, the former foreign minister, and more recently General Li Shangfu, the defence minister. The swiftness of their apparent downfalls has been striking. The questions they raise about China\u2019s politics are big. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is no sign that this is an existential moment for the Communist Party, or Mr Xi\u2019s rule. Adulation of Mr Xi continues unabated in state media. He stayed away from the G20 summit in Delhi on September 9th and 10th\u2014an unprecedented absence. But on September 16th and 17th Wang Yi, who succeeded Mr Qin as foreign minister in late July, met America\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, in Malta. According to Bloomberg, they discussed a possible meeting between Mr Xi and President Joe Biden at a gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders scheduled for November in San Francisco. China\u2019s military activities appear unaffected, too. On September 17th and 18th about 100 Chinese fighter jets flew around Taiwan, an unusually high number in such a space of time. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the churn at the highest levels of the state and military apparatus has been unusually fast, even by the standards of Mr Xi\u2019s purge-filled tenure. General Li has not been seen in public since August 29th, when he appeared at a China-Africa security forum. He was supposed to attend an annual meeting with Vietnamese defence officials on September 7th and 8th. But that plan was scrapped, with Chinese officials citing the general\u2019s health. Unspecified illnesses seem to be a common problem for those in political trouble. Mr Qin was said to have a health condition, too. But according to the Wall Street Journal, senior Chinese officials were told in secret last month that he had \u201clifestyle issues\u201d. They allegedly involved an extramarital affair, resulting in the birth of a child, while Mr Qin was ambassador in Washington before becoming foreign minister. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On official websites, no change has been indicated in General Li\u2019s duties. But American and other officials have told Western media that they believe he has been relieved of his post. Reuters reported that he was suspected of corruption related to the procurement of military equipment, which he oversaw from 2017 to 2022. The news agency said that eight senior officials from the procurement department were being investigated, too. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is also speculation that graft is a reason for the replacement in late July (announced in state media) of General Li Yuchao and General Xu Zhongbo. They were the two most senior commanders of the Rocket Force, which controls China\u2019s nuclear and conventional missiles. General Li Yuchao had been put in charge only last year. A less high-profile but equally unusual personnel change came to light on September 1st with the dismissal of Major General Cheng Dongfang as president of the People\u2019s Liberation Army military court after just eight months in the job. No reason was given. General Cheng had previously served as spokesman of China\u2019s military garrison in Hong Kong. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On Chinese social media, censors have stifled most discussion. Only one comment is visible on the post of a user with more than 670,000 followers who hinted at the defence minister\u2019s absence. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of having your account closed down?\u201d it says. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about him.\u201d But given Mr Xi\u2019s efforts to portray China\u2019s political system as a more stable and effective alternative to liberal democracy, the purges have provided rich pickings for his foreign critics. On X (formerly Twitter) America\u2019s ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, compared the turnover to Agatha Christie\u2019s novel, \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d. He later offered another literary analogy: \u201cAs Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, \u2018Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\u2019.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To be sure, the posts of defence minister and foreign minister are not as critical in China as they often are in other countries. Neither General Li nor Mr Qin are among the 24 members of the Politburo, the apex of political power. But the ministerial jobs involve defending the country\u2019s interests abroad. (In China\u2019s eyes, Mr Qin\u2019s alleged behaviour may have made him a security risk.) And the purges raise questions about Mr Xi\u2019s ability to select the right talent and his capacity to scare officials into avoiding corruption. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The moves have targeted people who were clearly Mr Xi\u2019s men. Mr Qin\u2019s elevation to the rank of foreign minister was unusually rapid, suggesting he may have impressed Mr Xi during a stint as the chief organiser of his foreign trips. He was promoted last year to the party\u2019s Central Committee and in March got the additional title of state councillor (a senior role in China\u2019s cabinet). Only four others hold that rank, including General Li. The defence minister is also a Central Committee member and one of the six officers who work under Mr Xi in the armed forces\u2019 governing body, the Central Military Commission."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Team of no rivals"}, {"role": "body", "text": "General Li and Mr Qin were among many people close to Mr Xi who benefited from the reshuffle in March as well as another one last October involving party jobs. The overhaul produced a ruling team more seemingly in lockstep with the paramount leader than any since the era of Mao Zedong. In China, questions will certainly be asked (in whispers) about how stable it is."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Mr Xi must be used to muttering. His previous purges have affected hundreds of thousands of officials, high and low, including many in the services most vital to maintaining the party\u2019s grip on power: the armed forces, the police and the spy apparatus. Most of the fallen have been accused of corruption, but some, too, of political wrongdoing. Last September courts imposed lengthy prison sentences on several security chiefs accused of being corrupt, as well as members of a disloyal cabal. They included a former deputy minister of public security and a former justice minister. In 2015 Zhou Yongkang\u2014a retired head of China\u2019s internal security services and former member of the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee\u2014was sentenced to life in prison for bribery and leaking state secrets. Mr Xi accused him and other jailed associates of attempting to \u201cseize power\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "If General Li is replaced as defence minister, there could be an upside for America. Last August, in response to a visit to Taiwan by the then speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, China halted regular talks between the two countries\u2019 defence establishments. America is keen to restart them, seeing them as useful for discussing ways of preventing unintended clashes. But while working in procurement, General Li was placed under American sanctions in 2018 for buying fighter jets and missiles from Russia. China wants the sanctions to be lifted before talks resume. Removing the man himself may resolve an impasse. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 17}
