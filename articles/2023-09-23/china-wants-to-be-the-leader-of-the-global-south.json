Yet Zhou\u2019s dapper ghost hung over a recent speech given in Havana to developing-world leaders by Li Xi, boss of the feared Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Indeed, the whole speech was filled with nods to the past. Mr Li recalled mid-20th-century struggles for \u201cnational independence and liberation\u201d. He mentioned the \u201cBandung Spirit\u201d and \u201cFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\u201d. That refers to the Bandung Conference of 1955, at which Zhou committed China to a path of non-aggression and non-interference in the affairs of other Asian and African countries. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The discipline-enforcement boss was sent to Cuba as Mr Xi\u2019s personal envoy to a summit involving China and emerging economies from the G77 group. He promised that China will \u201calways be part of the developing world and a member of the global south\u201d, no matter how advanced it becomes. By way of explanation, Mr Li reached back into history. China is forever bound to other nations that fought colonial-era \u201cexploitation and oppression\u201d, he said. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Li, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the top leadership body, was not speaking off the cuff. Nor was his cold-war history lesson a one-off, inspired by the sight of shark-finned old Cadillacs chugging through Havana. China has launched a new, concerted campaign to present itself as a natural leader for the developing world, starting with countries that have painful memories of bullying by colonial powers or by America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On September 13th the foreign ministry published a \u201cProposal of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Reform and Development of Global Governance\u201d. This urges sweeping changes to the rules and institutions that oversee international development, security and human rights. It finds many lessons in history. America (referred to as a \u201ccertain country\u201d) is told to learn from past wrongdoing, including ignoring Russia\u2019s \u201clegitimate security concerns\u201d, making \u201cwanton use\u201d of sanctions and hampering scientific progress with \u201chegemonic\u201d controls on technology sales."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the name of redressing \u201chistorical injustices\u201d, China calls for developing countries to be given a much greater say at the United Nations, including seats for Africa on an expanded Security Council (the proposal makes no mention of China\u2019s rival, India, a developing giant that has long sought a seat on the council). Restating long-standing Chinese arguments, the proposal calls the rights to subsistence and development \u201cthe basic human rights of paramount importance.\u201d All other rights must bow to \u201cnational realities\u201d. To advance that worldview, China proposes that UN human-rights bodies should employ more citizens from developing countries as soon as possible. More clearly than ever before, the document weaves together Mr Xi\u2019s big foreign-policy proposals, from the Belt and Road Initiative to the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilisation Initiative. It presents them as China\u2019s unified plan for tackling everything from climate change to the regulation of cyberspace. The stated goal: to create a \u201cbetter future for humanity\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The proposal was followed days later by a joint statement issued by Mr Xi and Zambia\u2019s president, Hakainde Hichilema, who was on a state visit to China. The statement names and endorses Mr Xi\u2019s various global initiatives in turn. China\u2019s preferred foreign policies are presented as in the common interest of developing countries. Rich states are reminded of their \u201cinescapable historical responsibilities over climate change\u201d, and told to take the lead in reducing emissions. Zambia declares China a new model for countries seeking independent paths towards modernisation. Independence is relative, of course. Zambia owes China billions of dollars. After long resistance, Chinese lenders agreed to restructure much of this debt in June, but largely by extending maturities and offering to suspend interest payments for some years, rather than by writing off loans.

Many low- and middle-income countries resent Western arguments about right and wrong. They blame sanctions on Russia, imposed by Western countries over its invasion of Ukraine, for high food and energy prices. In response, China is presenting itself as leader of something resembling a new, non-aligned movement. China calls for \u201ctrue multilateralism\u201d, delivered by international bodies, from the UN to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, that are no longer dominated by America and other rich liberal democracies. It talks of respecting the diversity of the world\u2019s civilisations: code for rejecting liberal values as a form of Western-centric racism. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s non-aligned posture does not stand much scrutiny, though. In the original non-aligned movement, Egypt, India, Yugoslavia and others gained clout by forming an ideologically unpredictable and diverse group, says Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. This time, for all the \u201cmood music about anti-colonialism\u201d, what China is offering is \u201ca coalition of states that China would lead\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "By declaring that a rich China would still be a developing country, Chinese leaders are manipulating language so that \u201cdeveloping\u201d ceases to be an economic term and means \u201cnon-Western\u201d, says a diplomat. The goal is to rally non-Western countries around Mr Xi\u2019s favoured vision for global governance. Some will be wary, adds the diplomat, for they wish \u201cto diversify their strategic, economic and political interests\u201d, not sign up to a China-led bloc.
