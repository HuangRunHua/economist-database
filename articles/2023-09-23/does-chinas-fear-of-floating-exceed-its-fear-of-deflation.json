A country might want a stable currency, free capital flows and an independent monetary policy, which can respond to the needs of the domestic economy, regardless of what central banks elsewhere are doing. There are, however, intrinsic tensions between these objectives. And so, sad to say, a country can choose only two of the three."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The trilemma is a canonical bit of theory. In practice, however, the choice is not so stark. No country can have all three blessings in full.

A property slump, low consumer morale and falling exports have marred the economy\u2019s reopening from covid-19, contributing to dangerously low inflation. In response, China\u2019s central bank has eased its monetary stance, even as interest rates have risen dramatically in America and elsewhere. It lowered reserve requirements for banks on September 15th for the second time this year. It has also twice cut interest rates."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s slowdown and its monetary response have, predictably, weighed on the yuan. From mid-January, when euphoria about China\u2019s reopening peaked, to September 8th, the yuan fell by 9% against the dollar. On the face of it, this is a good thing. A weaker currency should boost exports and ward off deflation. According to Goldman Sachs, a bank, a sustained 10% drop in the yuan against China\u2019s trade partners could add 0.75 percentage points to China\u2019s growth, which is struggling to reach 5% this year. It could also increase consumer-price inflation, which is near zero, by one percentage points in the long term."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China, however, would also like a little currency stability to go with its monetary independence. It fears that sharp declines in the yuan can lead investors to expect further falls. It still bears the scars of 2015, when a devaluation triggered heavy capital outflows. The central bank thus feels inhibited in its exercise of monetary autonomy. Its rate cuts have been small\u2014only 0.1 percentage points each time for the short-term rate. They have also been discreet. In June it cut this seven-day rate two days earlier than such moves are normally made, notes Becky Liu of Standard Chartered, another bank, perhaps to avoid too conspicuous a clash with the monetary-policy meeting of America\u2019s Federal Reserve."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s central bank has also tried to prop up the yuan. Officials have told speculators not to take one-sided bets. They have cut foreign-exchange reserve requirements for banks, releasing dollars into the system. The central bank has tightened yuan liquidity offshore, making it harder for speculators to borrow yuan in order to sell it. The central bank\u2019s own foreign-exchange reserves fell by $44bn in August, not all of which can be easily accounted for by changes in the valuation of assets it holds. This raises the possibility that the bank intervened modestly itself."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s distinctive exchange-rate system also gives the central bank a chance to intervene in another way. The yuan is not allowed to float by more than 2% above or below a \u201cfix\u201d, which the bank calculates each morning. The fix is supposed to reflect the previous day\u2019s market forces. But the bank sometimes introduces what it calls a \u201ccountercyclical factor\u201d (ie, a fudge factor) into its calculations. This has allowed it to set the fix at a rate that is stronger than the previous day\u2019s close. Indeed, in recent days there has been more fudge in the fix than ever before.

It tightens financial conditions, undoing some of the monetary easing the central bank is pursuing. Although a slightly more stable yuan can be engineered, it produces a somewhat less powerful monetary stimulus. China can have a little of everything.
