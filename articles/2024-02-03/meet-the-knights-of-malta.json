The meeting, from January 25th-27th, brought together the ambassadors of perhaps the oddest entity in international law, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Once the Crusaders\u2019 medical corps, the order later ruled Malta for more than 250 years. Driven out by Napoleon in 1798, its knights (and later dames) retained that intangible yet priceless asset, sovereignty. That lets the order not only maintain diplomatic relations with other states, but also issue stamps, coins, passports and car number-plates. Its Grand Master is entitled to be addressed as \u201cYour Highness\u201d and what little territory he rules\u2014a villa on the Aventine Hill in Rome and a mansion near the Spanish Steps\u2014is not part of Italy. The Italian soldiers and police guarding the ambassadors\u2019 pow-wow stayed outside the villa\u2019s gate."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today the order is essentially a Catholic humanitarian NGO\u2014and a very big one, with 13,500 knights and dames, almost 100,000 volunteers and more than 50,000 professional staff who care for the victims of natural disasters, wars, epidemics and poverty. In a room decorated with the coats of arms of scores of past dignitaries of the order, Riccardo Patern\u00f2 di Montecupo, its Grand Chancellor (similar to a prime minister), says its members do not proselytise. But, he adds, \u201cIf our work touches the heart of someone, well, we are very happy.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The order also runs permanent structures, notably the Holy Family Maternity Hospital in Bethlehem. It has no diplomatic relations with Israel. But, perhaps ironically in the land of the Crusades, it maintains an ambassador to Palestine: an American, Michele Burke Bowe. Like many other humanitarian outfits, it has been unable to gain access to the Gaza Strip. \u201cBut as soon as the occasion presents itself, we\u2019ll be in Gaza,\u201d says Ms Burke Bowe. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 38}
