Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, recently boasted that Britain had stepped up to the challenge of a more dangerous \u201cpre-war\u201d world: by \u201cinvesting billions into modernising our armed forces\u2026when the world needed us we have risen to the moment\u201d."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240203_BRC243.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 1137.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet for all the billions and the bravado, the British armed forces are stretched perilously thin. The perception within Britain and among its NATO allies, particularly America, is one of relatively declining military power\u2014of forces so small that they risk falling below critical mass, large procurement projects that go horribly wrong, an underfunded defence-equipment plan and a crisis of recruitment. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These problems show up most obviously in the army. In 2021 the then defence secretary, Ben Wallace, decided to reduce the projected size of the army by 10,000, to 72,500 by 2025 (see chart). Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has changed the security environment but not the cuts. General Sir Nick Carter, a recent chief of the defence staff, has warned that they could undermine Britain\u2019s NATO commitment to be able to field a full division in Europe. Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute, another think-tank, says the idea of a smaller but still capable force is all very well but \u201cland warfare requires a bigger orchestra\u201d. One senior officer calls it a \u201chollowed-out shambles\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although the army is getting an upgraded tank, the Challenger 3, it is ordering only 148 of them. By comparison, Poland is aiming for a fleet of 1,600 modern tanks. American generals and other allies have openly questioned whether after decades of cuts Britain\u2019s army can be regarded as even a small top-level fighting force."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are still wide gaps in what it needs to be a credible force against a peer or near-peer enemy, including sufficient air defence, long-range missiles and electronic-warfare assets. There are concerns within the army that it lacks adequate intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and that it does not have enough artillery. The army was short of munitions even before donations from its inventory to Ukraine. Although \u00a32bn was allocated for replenishing its stocks last year, the money is at risk of vanishing into the general maw of the defence budget."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Chalmers says that although the army now has quite a big capital-equipment programme, much of it is not yet on contract and could be cancelled or delayed. History suggests that there is a decent chance things will go wrong. The army has been both victim and culprit in two of the most troubled procurement programmes of recent years: the \u00a33.2bn Morpheus battlefield-communication system and, especially, a \u00a35.5bn contract for the Ajax armoured fighting vehicle. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ajax was meant to be an off-the-shelf replacement for the Warrior armoured vehicle; it was due to start coming into service by 2018. However, it was loaded up with 1,200 \u201ccapability requirements\u201d and ordered with a 40mm gun that no other armies had asked for. The result has been massive delays. The emergence of noise and vibration problems that were a danger to crews took years to resolve. The programme\u2019s failings were laid bare in a 172-page report published last year under the optimistic title of the \u201cLessons Learned Review\u201d. It made 24 recommendations for improving the way the defence ministry\u2019s procurement arm, Defence Equipment &amp; Support, manages major programmes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The navy and air force are suffering similar problems. In 2021 the government conducted an \u201cIntegrated Review\u201d of its foreign, defence, development and security policies (it was refreshed in 2023 because of Ukraine). The defence committee of the House of Commons concluded two years ago that the navy could not fulfil the review\u2019s ambition for a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d with its current fleet, and that it needed more lower-end, adaptable vessels like the planned Type 31 frigate (the first of five is expected to enter service in 2027, four years later than first intended)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The navy is benefiting from significant capital investment, with new frigates and a planned successor to the Astute-class nuclear attack submarine as part of the AUKUS submarine deal with America and Australia. But the running costs and manpower demands of its two aircraft-carriers, first conceived of in the late 1990s, have had knock-on effects. Under current plans, the navy will have just 19 escort vessels. \u201cThe navy is too small by about half. We don\u2019t have the flexibility to carry out full-spectrum activities,\u201d says Tobias Ellwood, a former chair of the defence committee."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nor have decisions taken in 2021 to reduce air power been revisited, despite the war in Ukraine. Those decisions include: early withdrawal from service of the Tranche 1 Typhoons to cannibalise them for spare parts; the early retirement of C-130s, with adverse effects on lift capacity generally and on special forces specifically; and the baffling choice to cut an order for the E-7 Wedgetail airborne-warning-and-control aircraft from five to three, for a saving of only 12% on the capital cost (\u201cLunacy,\u201d says Mr Ellwood). Britain is leading a joint programme with Japan and Italy to develop a sixth-generation fighter to replace the Typhoon in the mid-2030s. But whether Britain will buy enough aircraft to make the project viable is debatable."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Ellwood points out that when the cold war ended Britain had 31 fast jet squadrons \u201cbut now we may struggle to have seven\u201d. The big concern is the loss of \u201ccombat mass\u201d, which has been much steeper for Britain than for France, Germany or Italy. A further cause for concern has been the \u201cpainfully slow\u201d programme to upgrade the Typhoons with AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar, which, says Douglas Barrie of the IISS, is \u201cthe single key sensor on modern aircraft\u201d."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Fit kit?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fixing such problems is made far harder by the ballooning cost of the programme to replace Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent, which has priority over everything else. It is now projected to account for 34% of the entire planned equipment budget of \u00a3289bn for the ten years to 2033. If the cost of the nuclear deterrent is left out, Britain is spending only about 1.75% of GDP on defence."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A report in December by the National Audit Office (NAO), an independent spending watchdog, declared the latest defence-equipment plan, which was recently updated, to be \u201cunaffordable\u201d (see chart). The cost of the plan had gone up to \u00a3306bn, revealing a \u201cblack hole\u201d of \u00a317bn (even this is a central estimate that the NAO thinks underestimates the problem). The main reason is the escalating cost of the Defence Nuclear Organisation, which includes the new attack submarines, four Dreadnought ballistic-missile submarines and the development of a new nuclear warhead. Costs have gone up by 62% since the NAO\u2019s previous report just a year earlier. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To add to Britain\u2019s military problems, it is also experiencing a severe recruitment and retention crisis. The air force lacks the pilots and engineers needed to operate a bigger fleet of aircraft. The navy has been forced to retire older ships from service because it lacks crew. The army is struggling to meet even the reduced numbers that have been set, and may have fewer than 70,000 personnel within two years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some of the problems have been laid at the door of Capita, an outsourcing contractor that uses call centres to interview potential recruits. It can take months before an applicant even meets a serving officer. Low pay, poor food and often lousy accommodation (also largely managed by outsourcing companies) are partly to blame. Hopes of recruiting more skilled women have been set back by a stream of stories about sexual harassment in the forces."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A speech on January 25th by General Sir Patrick Sanders, the head of the army, calling for the training of a \u201ccitizen army\u201d was misinterpreted as a plea for the return of conscription.

Another suggestion is for fit and willing former regular soldiers, of whom there are probably about 200,000, to be invited to exercises once a year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The issues undermining Britain\u2019s armed forces come up time and again: endemic skills shortages across all branches of the services; a culture of applying short-term fixes; a broken procurement system that too often results in poor value for money.
