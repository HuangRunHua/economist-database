It was hit badly by a sharp rise in food prices from the war in Ukraine and its currency is one of the world\u2019s worst-performing (see chart). Repayments on its external debts are forecast to reach $29bn (8% of gdp) this year. To stay afloat Egypt has relied on deposits from the Gulf and frequent infusions from the IMF: it is now the fund\u2019s second-biggest debtor. True to form, imf officials are back in Cairo to stave off a default."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Egypt\u2019s economic problems predate the war in Gaza, but the conflict and its overspill in the Red Sea are threatening to tip it over the edge.

The attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by the Houthis have cut traffic through the Suez Canal by about half. It usually carries some 30% of global container traffic and earned Egypt $9.4bn in transit fees in the 12 months to June. Meanwhile a hot summer drove up electricity use, cutting Egypt\u2019s exports of oil and gas."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Egyptians abroad, nervous of transferring money into a tanking currency, are withholding remittances. In the third quarter of 2022 they fell by about 30% compared with a year earlier. Foreign investors are withdrawing their capital, or demanding high interest rates to keep it there. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since wheat and oil prices spiked in 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, Mr Sisi has devalued the Egyptian pound three times. Officially the currency has fallen by about 50% over this period, but on the black market it is worth 70 to the dollar, less than a quarter of its former value. That is fuelling inflation, which reached an annual rate of 34% in December, up from 6% two years ago. The falling pound also means the government now spends 60% of its budget servicing its debts."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since Mr Sisi took power in 2013, Egypt\u2019s external debt has quadrupled. That is partly because of the president\u2019s costly megaprojects, which include a gleaming new capital, lots of other cities and highways. The capital, into which Mr Sisi has sunk $60bn (15% of gdp), stands empty. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some spending has slowed; work on a monorail to the new capital has stopped. But mostly the president continues to justify splashing his cash on the grounds of social stability, not economics. \u201cI employ 5m-6m people\u2026how could we shut all this down?\u201d he asked in January. Without such jobs, the unemployment rate of 7% would soar, his officials insist. So new projects keep coming and handouts, such as the annual bread subsidy which eats up $2.9bn, or 2.6% of the state budget, persist. \u201cWe\u2019re bankrupt but still spending like no tomorrow,\u201d says one financial analyst in Cairo."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The army is also to blame. Under Mr Sisi, Egypt\u2019s generals have tightened their grip on its economy. They hide away in compounds, ignoring the moans of poor Egyptians beyond their gates.

He recently suggested Egyptians were lucky not to be in Gaza:\u201cThings are expensive and some things are not available? So what?\u201d His security forces guard against trouble. Tens of thousands of suspected opponents languish in jail. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To judge by December\u2019s election, Mr Sisi remains popular. He won the poll, which was surely rigged, by almost 90%, with the highest turnout in years. But the streets heave with discontent. \u201cMay presidents fall,\u201d protesters chanted in January. Support for the army has faded since 2011, when it allowed a revolution to topple Hosni Mubarak. Then, as now, rising bread prices fuelled anger. But the economic crisis is far worse today."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Economic weakness also hampers the army\u2019s ability to project strength abroad. Qatar, a tiny but rich Gulf emirate, is supplanting Egypt as the main negotiator between Israel and Hamas. Despite the threat to the Suez Canal\u2019s revenues, Egypt has recoiled from joining America\u2019s coalition against the Houthis. Mr Sisi has been powerless to stop landlocked Ethiopia damming the Nile and leasing a Red Sea naval base in Somaliland, a breakaway enclave."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, strongmen can benefit from wars. The security forces prey on refugees. Palestinians pay them $5,000 or more to escape Gaza. Egypt hopes to capitalise on fears of the crisis that would follow if conflict spilled over its borders or it defaulted on debt. After the election, the imf had been expected to demand the economic reforms Mr Sisi had promised in late 2022 as a condition for the fund to release most of a $3bn loan. Another devaluation of the pound was widely predicted, or even its free float, together with a shift in investment away from vanity megaprojects."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Instead Mr Sisi appears to have won a reprieve. When so much of the region is aflame, he reasons, its foreign allies will deem Egypt too big to fail. Neither its Western nor Gulf creditors are rushing to collect their debts. And as The Economist went to press, the imf was expected to double or more its original $3bn package, beginning with a $3bn loan with few strings attached. \u201cDive deeply and you\u2019ll see Egypt has benefited a lot from war,\u201d says Ahmed Aboudouh, an Egyptian expert at Chatham House, a think-tank in London. That will bring short-term relief. But it will also further entrench the generals who have hollowed out the economy. \u201cThe same people who are benefiting from the system are asked to change it,\u201d says a former Egyptian finance official. \u201cIn the long term it will never work.\u201d \u25a0"}], "id": 29}
