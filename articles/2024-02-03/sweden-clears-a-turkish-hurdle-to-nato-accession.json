The long wait came to an end on January 25th, when Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, signed off on Sweden\u2019s accession protocols, shortly after his country\u2019s parliament backed the agreement. The ink of Mr Erdogan\u2019s signature had barely dried when America agreed to provide Turkey with 40 new F-16 fighter jets and to modernise another 79, a deal worth some $23bn. America simultaneously approved the sale of up to 40 F-35 stealth fighters to Greece."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The timing was no coincidence. For well over a year Mr Erdogan had used his veto power over NATO\u2019s enlargement to seek concessions from his Western allies. The F-16 sale is the most important of these. Mr Erdogan has not made any new friends in NATO. But he has notched up a number of victories. He got both Sweden and Finland to scrap their arms embargoes against Turkey, imposed in 2019 after Turkey launched an offensive against Kurdish insurgents in Syria. On January 29th Canada, another NATO member, said it would resume exports of drone parts to Turkey, which it had suspended in 2020."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Erdogan waved through Finland\u2019s membership last March, but kept Sweden jumping through hoops. In response to Turkish pressure to crack down against the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), an outlawed Kurdish group, the Nordic country passed a new terrorism law in 2023, a move that needed constitutional changes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sweden\u2019s accession also became entangled in a row featuring America, Turkey and Greece, another member of the alliance. Ever since it was booted from America\u2019s F-35 programme as a result of its purchase of an air-defence system from Russia, Turkey has sought to buy new F-16s and upgrade the ones it bought years ago. Mr Erdogan wanted the Americans to unblock the sale, which had been held up by Congress for years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But America played hardball as well. Its officials made clear they would continue to block the F-16 sale unless Mr Erdogan gave Sweden the green light. They also suggested America would push ahead with the sale of the F-35s to Greece without waiting for Turkey, a move that risked upsetting the balance of power between the two neighbours. That threat helped clear the way for the vote. Sweden is now only a single Hungary-shaped hurdle away from membership in the alliance."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The F-16 sale will not transform America\u2019s relations with Turkey, thanks to continued irritation in Washington over Turkey\u2019s human-rights record, Mr Erdogan\u2019s support for Hamas and his reluctance to stand up to Russia. But the new planes will help anchor Turkey in NATO and strengthen its dependence on America\u2019s arms makers for spare parts and maintenance, at least for a while. Turkey is working on its own indigenous aircraft, known as the Kaan. But it is not likely to enter into service for another decade or so. The F-16s are expected to keep flying well into the late 2040s. Anyone prognosticating too anxiously over Turkey\u2019s imminent departure from NATO might take note. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 39}
