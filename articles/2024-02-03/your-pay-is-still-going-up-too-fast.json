Rich-world prices are rising by 5.4% year on year, down from a peak of 10.7% in October 2022. Although this is impressive progress, the last part of their quest\u2014getting inflation from 5.4% to official targets of around 2%\u2014could be the most difficult. That is because labour markets are not co-operating.

In 2022-23 Google searches related to \u201clabour shortage\u201d jumped to their highest-ever level. With plenty of other options, workers asked for big pay rises. Year-on-year wage growth across the rich world doubled from its pre-covid rate to close to 5% (see chart), adding to firms\u2019 costs and in turn encouraging them to raise the prices they charged consumers.

Given weak productivity growth across the rich world, a 2% inflation target is probably achievable only if nominal wages grow by 3% a year or less. Central bankers hoped that by raising interest rates they would cause demand for labour to fall\u2014ideally cooling wage inflation without wrecking people\u2019s livelihoods. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first part of the plan has worked. Demand for labour (ie, filled jobs plus unfilled vacancies) is now only 0.4% higher than the supply of workers, down from 1.6%. Searches for \u201clabour shortage\u201d have fallen by a third. Almost everywhere you are less likely to see \u201chelp wanted\u201d signs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lower demand for labour has also caused surprisingly little damage to people\u2019s employment prospects. We estimate that, over the past year, falling vacancies have accounted for the entire decline in labour demand across the rich world. During the same period the number of people actually in work has increased. The unemployment rate across the rich world remains below 5%. Some countries are even beating records. In Italy the share of working-age people in a job recently hit an all-time high\u2014the country has swapped la dolce vita for la laboriosa vita."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nevertheless, despite falling labour demand, there is less evidence of the final part of the plan: lower wage inflation. Although American pay growth has subsided from more than 5.5% year on year to around 4.5%, that is probably still too high for the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% inflation target. And elsewhere there is little sign of progress. In recent quarters wage growth across the rich world has hovered at 5% year on year. British wage growth is more than 6%. \u201cVery early indications for January show negotiated pay deals slowing only modestly,\u201d reported analysts at JPMorgan Chase, a bank, last week. Euro-area pay is growing similarly fast."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Is high wage growth, and thus above-target inflation, now baked into the economic cake? Some evidence suggests it is\u2014especially in Europe. Spanish workers, for instance, have used their extra bargaining power to change their contracts, so that the share of workers whose pay is indexed to the inflation rate has risen from 16% in 2014-21 to 45% last year. A recent study by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, on Belgium worries about \u201cmore persistent inflation due to wage indexation\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "More generous wage agreements today could mean higher inflation tomorrow, leading in turn to even more generous agreements. Across the rich world strikes have become more common as workers seek higher wages. Last year America lost almost 17m working days to stoppages, more than in the previous ten years combined. Britain has also seen a surge in industrial action. On January 30th Aslef, a union for train drivers, began a series of walkouts, to the dismay of commuters. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is, however, a more optimistic interpretation of these developments. Just as in 2021-22, when wages took a while to accelerate after labour demand rose, so today they could take time to lose speed. After all, companies and workers renegotiate wages infrequently\u2014often annually\u2014meaning that workers may only slowly realise that they have less bargaining power than before. Indeed, estimates for America published by Goldman Sachs, another bank, suggest that it can take a year or so for declines in labour demand to show up in lower wage growth\u2014suggesting that the final stretch of disinflation will be annoyingly slow, but will pass. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 68}
