Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, has rejected a Palestinian state. Offering Israeli citizenship to the Palestinians is not likely, because they would then have the same rights as Israelis to lease land, and could claim protection against harassment and the confiscation of their land by other Israeli citizens.
