Many people favour his first, \u201cDecline and Fall\u201d; others tout \u201cScoop\u201d, a satire of mid-20th-century journalism. But for sustained comic brilliance our vote goes to \u201cThe Loved One\u201d, published in 1948. During the previous year Waugh had visited California, at the invitation of Hollywood studios. Tiring of agents and producers, he became fascinated by the local mortuary and embalming business. \u201cThe Loved One\u201d, set in the Whispering Glades Memorial Park, was the result. The story concerns a doomed love affair between a failed poet, Dennis Barlow, and a prim funerary cosmetician, Aim\u00e9e Thanatogenos. It\u2019s a hilarious dissection of the English in Hollywood, of American business ethics and of Hollywood itself. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Snippet.

At odds with the modern world, this slothful behemoth of a man-boy farts, belches and bickers his way through a succession of lowly jobs in New Orleans to pay off his drunken mama\u2019s debts, the erratic Mrs Reilly being his only consistent companion. The laughs are all in Ignatius\u2019s haughty, misanthropic reflections on those unfortunate enough to come into his odorous orbit. Several publishers rejected Toole\u2019s book\u2014one reason why he committed suicide in 1969, aged only 31.

Its heroines, like Bridget, are often SINBADS (Single Income, No Boyfriend and Absolutely Desperate). \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary\u201d started the series, but its sequel, \u201cThe Edge of Reason\u201d (published in 1999), is even funnier, partly because Bridget at least starts off with \u201cboyfriends 1 (hurrah!)\u201d, Mark Darcy. This allows Ms Fielding to get into Bridget\u2019s pantomime of a love life that much quicker. Our heroine tries to be a liberated, independent woman, if fortified by chardonnay and self-help books. But too often she slips into slavish dependence on unsuitable men with questionable taste in jumpers. The enemy? Smug Married Girls. It\u2019s not exactly radical feminism, but the combination persuaded women (and men) to buy Bridget Jones books in the millions.

But the tone of \u201cLucky Jim\u201d is not so much angry as irreverent and waspish. It chronicles the misadventures of an inept young history lecturer, Jim Dixon, in a provincial university in repressed, dreary post-war Britain. Academic life, amateur choirs and middle-class sexual mores are all skewered, often in hilarious set-pieces. Just as Bridget Jones inspired chick lit, \u201cLucky Jim\u201d spawned the campus novel.

In terse prose, \u201cDeath and the Penguin\u201d recounts a few weeks in the life of an aspiring writer, Viktor, whose only close companion is Misha, a king penguin he rescued from the bankrupt zoo in Kyiv. The depressive Misha waddles around their small flat, holding up a mirror to his saviour\u2019s own bleak life. Viktor gains a commission from a newspaper to write obituaries, but discovers that his subjects are not necessarily dead yet; rather, they become dead after his obits are published, the victims of mysterious mafia-style executions.

Two feuding sisters, Vera and Nadezhda, conspire to stop their 84-year-old Ukrainian-born father, who is recently widowed, from marrying Valentina, a 36-year-old gold-digger. Infatuated with her \u201cgolden hair\u201d and Botticelli breasts, Viktor assures his daughters that Valentina also has strong views on Nietzsche, and, like him, abhors neoclassicism. They are unconvinced. Set in Peterborough, England, the novel is a riotous depiction of sibling rivalry and masculine pride. It sets the values of the first-generation, immigrant sisters against the materialistic culture of the Ukrainian Valentina. As hostilities unfold, the sisters learn plenty about their own Ukrainian heritage, not least because their father, an engineer, is writing an absolutely riveting history of the country\u2019s tractors.
