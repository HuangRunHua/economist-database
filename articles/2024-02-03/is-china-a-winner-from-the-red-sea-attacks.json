The plot revolves around a naval special-forces operation to rescue a Chinese citizen taken hostage by terrorists in a Yemen-like Red Sea country. \u201cThis mission is a message to all terrorists that you will never harm a Chinese citizen,\u201d intones the commanding officer.

But since mid-November, when Houthi rebels in Yemen began attacking shipping in the Red Sea with missiles and drones, American officials have been prodding China to show some of that great-power spirit by helping to resolve a real-life crisis in the region. During 12 hours of meetings on January 26th and 27th in Bangkok, America\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, tried to persuade China\u2019s foreign-affairs chief, Wang Yi, that China\u2019s influence could be used to stop the threat to a major artery of global trade. China, however, views its responsibilities differently. It does not want to flex muscle in the Middle East. China sees the region\u2019s security as a quagmire of America\u2019s making.

There has been speculation that the Houthis had outdated information about the vessel, which previously had been chartered by an Israeli firm. On January 19th the Houthis said Chinese and Russian ships would enjoy safe passage through the Red Sea. But much of China\u2019s maritime trade involves ships registered in other countries.

According to a senior American official, Mr Sullivan stressed this during his meeting with Mr Wang in Bangkok. Reuters says that during several recent encounters in Beijing and Tehran, Chinese officials have indeed asked their Iranian counterparts to rein in the Houthis. The Chinese message has been that: \u201cIf our interests are harmed in any way, it will impact our business with Tehran,\u201d the news agency quoted an Iranian official as saying. The American official said China had confirmed it was talking to Iran about the attacks. \u201cBut we\u2019re certainly going to wait to see results before we comment further,\u201d he said, seeming unsure of \u201cwhether we think they\u2019re actually raising it\u201d.

In 2022 China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, unveiled a \u201cGlobal Security Initiative\u201d (GSI) that was clearly aimed at rallying support for China, especially among countries resentful of American hegemony. It called for resistance to \u201ccold war\u201d thinking and opposition to \u201cthe pursuit of one\u2019s own security at the cost of others\u2019 security\u201d.

In March last year, China claimed a victory for it in the Middle East, brokering a deal that saw Saudi Arabia and Iran restore diplomatic relations after a seven-year rupture. In reality it was low-hanging fruit. \u201cThey went to China, I think, to get that great-power stamp of approval at the very end of the process,\u201d says Jonathan Fulton of the Atlantic Council, an American think-tank. In the Red Sea, China cannot be expected to work GSI magic. American hopes that China might help end the crisis face several obstacles. One is China\u2019s willingness to use what the American official called its \u201csubstantial leverage\u201d in Iran, which exports about 90% of its oil to China. China welcomes this cheap supply of energy\u2014it accounts for about 10% of its crude oil imports. It relishes friendship with a country that shares its misgivings about American power.
