On January 28th Iran said it had launched three satellites; Western countries fear they could be used in its ballistic-missile programme. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has opened a new chapter in space war. But America\u2019s biggest dread is China, which seeks to match if not surpass America\u2019s primacy in the heavens.

Space planes\u2019 ability to undertake long missions, deliver and capture payloads, change orbit and return to Earth to refuel make them potentially important weapons. Russia launched Cosmos 2570 in October, the latest \u201cnesting doll\u201d in orbit: it released a second satellite, which then let out a third.

Within weeks, however, Ukrainian forces were back online thanks to the vast constellation of smaller Starlink broadband satellites launched by SpaceX, another private company.

Control of space has become as important as dominance on land, sea and air. Space technology makes military forces in all other domains more powerful.

In any future conflict between America and China, for instance, satellites would be essential to finding and destroying targets across the vast distances of the Pacific Ocean (see China section). Much about warfare in space remains hidden, and most of what is known comes from America. What is clear, though, is that America is intensifying its effort to preserve its edge in space."}, {"role": "body", "text": "General John Shaw, a former deputy head of Space Command, argues that the world has entered \u201cthe third space age\u201d. The first, in the cold war, was dominated by superpowers with large national-security satellites. Intelligence-gathering, early-warning and communications spacecraft were bound with nuclear deterrence. In the second stage, private firms became more prominent as they delivered communications, television and other services from space. Satellites such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) revolutionised conventional warfare, starting with the war in Iraq in 1991. Later on, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, they made possible precision bombing and long-distance drone operations. Space itself, though, was regarded as a sanctuary. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not so in the third age. Space services are woven ever more tightly into civilian life\u2014GPS enables everything from financial transactions to mapping apps.

America\u2019s Space Force, the youngest military service, seemed to be a whim of the then president, Donald Trump, when it was launched in 2019. In fact the germ of the idea had been around since at least 2001, when a bipartisan commission warned of a potential \u201cspace Pearl Harbour\u201d. Carved out of the air force, and administratively tied to it, Space Force is by far the smallest American military service, but is growing fast. It counts just 8,600 active personnel, compared with 322,000 for the air force, but is likely to expand by 9% this year. Its budget of $26bn last year, compared with $180bn for the air force, is set to grow by 15%. Some worry about unnecessary duplication. Others question how far it has succeeded in overcoming a legacy of slow and costly procurement.

But Space Command draws data from any radar it can, eg, those on warships. It is placing more sensors in Australia to cover the southern half of the globe, and is working with allies to share data.
