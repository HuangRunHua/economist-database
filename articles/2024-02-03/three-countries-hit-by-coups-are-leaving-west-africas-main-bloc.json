Yet it has been floundering since a spate of coups toppled the governments of Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Niger. Each time, ECOWAS imposed sanctions and demanded elections. Yet the juntas flagrantly broke promises and cosied up to Russia. A return to democracy in the Sahel is now a distant dream. The damage goes wider still.

After last year\u2019s coup in Niger, ECOWAS imposed economic sanctions and threatened to invade if it was not reversed. The junta instead stirred up crowds and the trio formed a mutual defence pact. ECOWAS backed down, though it kept sanctions in place. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s backing matters, too. The three states believe they have enough foreign support to ditch ECOWAS, even though they have also severed ties with France, which had been helping them fight the jihadists. Russian mercenaries have operated in Mali since late 2021. About 100 Russian soldiers arrived in Burkina Faso last week\u2014the first major deployment of Russians in the country\u2014to prevent any counter-coup.

The bloc\u2019s rules say leaving takes a year. Nigeria\u2019s foreign ministry slammed unelected leaders who \u201cengage in a public posturing to deny their people the sovereign right to make fundamental choices\u201d. But a highly-placed Nigerian official sounded more emollient, emphasising that every member country is \u201cvital to our union\u2026All avenues to engage members that are aggrieved will be explored\u201d. But it is unlikely that any of the juntas will reverse course. The real question is what sort of relations ECOWAS will maintain with the leavers.

Though far from perfect, ECOWAS cares about democracy and human rights and carried some influence. Without its involvement there is little hope of restoring democracy. The juntas will also have a freer hand to fight jihadists and target dissidents without pesky complaints about human rights, says Crisis Group\u2019s Ibrahim Yahaya. Human rights are already widely abused. In just one massacre in Mali in 2022 soldiers and Wagner mercenaries killed about 500 people, almost all civilians. In Burkina Faso the junta rounds up critics and sends them to the front."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The exit from ECOWAS will make it harder to stop the jihadists in the Sahel and may threaten the security of the bloc\u2019s remaining members. The border areas between the three leavers and their southern neighbours are already hotspots for jihadists, who are also attacking Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo. Countries need to co-operate closely to beat them. The eviction of French troops and UN peacekeepers has already worsened security. Last year was the bloodiest ever in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Almost 14,000 people, some 5,000 of them civilians, were killed in conflict, "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is also bad news for the trio\u2019s economies, which account for less than a tenth of the bloc\u2019s GDP, as they will lose free movement and preferential trade with Ghana and Nigeria, which account for about two-thirds of it, notes Charlie Robertson of FIM Partners, a fund manager.

Crucially, they will not yet lose trade and free movement to these countries because they (along with Niger) remain part of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, whose eight members share a common currency and allow free movement of people and goods.
