Following the arrival of competitors such as TikTok, powered by artificial intelligence, Facebook and other incumbents have been forced to reinvent themselves. Platforms that began as places for friends to interact and share their own content are turning into television-like feeds of entertainment, for passive consumption. At the same time, users are moving their conversations and arguments off the open networks and into closed, private groups on platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. That migration, in turn, will have big implications for politics, in a year when countries with more than half the world\u2019s population are heading to the polls."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Social media are more popular than ever. The average internet user spent nearly two and a half hours a day on social platforms last year, according to GWI, another data company.

Total time spent using social apps on Android devices, which account for about 70% of the world\u2019s phones and tablets, has risen by 42% since 2020, to 2.3trn hours last year, according to Data.ai."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the sort of social networking that Facebook pioneered is disappearing. The most obvious change is the shift to video on today\u2019s networks. The explosive success of TikTok, a Chinese-owned short-video app which launched in 2017 and quickly had young people hooked, has sparked a wave of copycats. Meta has added a video feature called Reels to Facebook and Instagram. Similar products have been bolted onto Pinterest (Watch), Snapchat (Spotlight) and YouTube (Shorts). Elon Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X, now claims it is a \u201cvideo-first\u201d platform. Of the 64 minutes per day that the average American spent on social media last year, 40 were spent watching video, up from 28 minutes three years earlier, estimates Bernstein, a broker."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The bigger change to social feeds is under the bonnet. At first, social networks showed chronological updates from users\u2019 contacts: their friend just got engaged, their uncle was storming the Capitol and so on. As the volume of posts grew, the networks employed algorithms to prioritise posts that had proved popular among the user\u2019s friends. Now a new phase has begun. TikTok decided that, rather than guessing what people would like based on their \u201csocial graph\u201d\u2014that is, what their family and friends liked\u2014it would use their \u201cinterest graph\u201d, which it inferred from the videos they and people like them lingered on. And rather than show content created by people they followed, it would serve up anything it thought they might like."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Every other big platform has followed suit. In 2022 Mr Zuckerberg announced that Facebook\u2019s feed would become a \u201cdiscovery engine\u201d to seek out engaging content from around the internet. Since last year half of the posts X shows its users come from outside the network of people they follow. Threads, Meta\u2019s Twitter-clone, launched last year with a similar approach. The resulting feeds of unrelated content from strangers can be jarring: \u201cHere\u2019s a healthy breakfast option! You should kill your mom!\u201d quipped Bo Burnham, a YouTube comedian, in a satirical song. But users seem to like it. Time spent on Instagram has risen by 40% since Meta launched Reels.

In a survey last year by Gartner, a market-research company, only 28% of Americans said they liked documenting their life online, down from 40% in 2020. Some 61% say they have become more selective about what they post, finds Morning Consult, another research firm, which speculates that an influx of \u201cinfluencer\u201d content may have made users think \u201ctheir everyday life is too mundane to justify frequent posts\u201d. Video, the new format of choice, is harder to create than dashing off a quick status update. And some platforms, such as X, prioritise posts by users who pay, reducing incentives for the rest."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Instead, conversations have been moving for some time to private groups. In 2021 Mr Zuckerberg wrote that, as well as debating in the \u201ctown square\u201d of Facebook and Instagram, \u201cPeople increasingly also want to connect privately in the digital equivalent of the living room.\u201d Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, said last year that more photos and videos were being shared in direct messages than on the app\u2019s main feed. \u201cAll the friends-sharing is moving in that direction,\u201d he concluded.

Although (and perhaps because) social networks are accused of driving political polarisation, they seem increasingly eager to steer users away from news and current affairs. A study by Joshua Tucker of the Centre for Social Media and Politics at New York University (NYU) and colleagues compared a group of Facebook and Instagram users who were on chronological newsfeeds in the run-up to America\u2019s election in 2020 with another group who used the platforms\u2019 recommendation algorithm. Those using the chronological feed saw 15% more political content on Facebook and 5% more on Instagram than those who were fed by the algorithm.

The firm now says that news makes up less than 3% of what people see on the platform. Mr Mosseri, who is also in charge of Threads, wrote at its launch last year, \u201cPolitics and hard news are inevitably going to show up on Threads\u2026but we\u2019re not going to do anything to encourage those verticals.\u201d A week later he added, \u201cFrom a platform\u2019s perspective, any incremental engagement or revenue they might drive is not at all worth the scrutiny, negativity (let\u2019s be honest), or integrity risks that come along with them.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A campaign by some publishers to make social-media firms pay to share their content has reinforced the networks\u2019 view that news is more trouble than it is worth.

The decline in sharing seems to affect the amount of political content in particular. Mr Tucker and colleagues found that removing shared content from users\u2019 Facebook feeds reduced the amount of political news they saw by more than half. (Again, it also reduced the amount of content from suspect sources, by nearly a third.)

TV ads are still believed to be the best when it comes to persuasion; those on social media are mainly about fundraising.

For one thing, some of the new digital platforms don\u2019t want their money. TikTok bans political advertising altogether. Threads, less than a year old, does not yet sell ads at all.
