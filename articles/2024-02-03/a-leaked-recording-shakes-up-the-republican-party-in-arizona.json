Mr DeWit was hardly \u201cbrand-new\u201d: he had taken over as party chair a year before (with Donald Trump\u2019s backing), promising to unite the party\u2019s feuding factions. More important, he had resigned the previous day, after what amounted to a coup orchestrated by the party\u2019s likely candidate for Senate, Kari Lake\u2014amid drama worthy of reality TV."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Arizona will be a critical state in the elections in November. \u201cThere\u2019s no path to the White House that doesn\u2019t run through Arizona,\u201d says Caroline Wren, an adviser to Ms Lake. \u201cAnd Arizona might well be the 51st Senate seat,\u201d determining whether or not Republicans can wrest back control."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Republican bigwigs were keen to field a Senate candidate with the best chance of winning. The lesson from the midterms was that strident Trump-backed candidates tend to lose. Ms Lake\u2019s own defeat in the Arizona governor\u2019s contest was a prime example: the former TV news anchor was a vocal supporter of Mr Trump\u2019s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. About 11 months ago Mr DeWit approached Ms Lake with a message from \u201cvery powerful people\u201d back east and an offer he hoped she would not refuse: an inducement to sit out the coming election cycle. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unfortunately for Mr DeWit, she not only refused, but recorded the conversation\u2014and last week it was leaked to DailyMail.com, a British news website. In the ten-minute tape Mr DeWit is heard suggesting that Ms Lake \u201cpause\u201d her electoral ambitions for two years. \u201cIs there a number\u201d that would persuade her to do so, he asks? An offended Ms Lake rejects the attempt to buy her off: \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to fucking kill me to stop me,\u201d she says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr DeWit claims that the tape was selectively edited. Yet he felt compelled to go."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Why did Ms Lake wait nearly 11 months to release the recording? Some Arizona Republicans had grown frustrated with Mr DeWit (among his sins, apparently, was being seen at several events of Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who until recently was competing for the Republican presidential nomination) and were preparing to challenge his leadership at a meeting of the state party on January 27th. Ms Lake\u2019s leak was exquisitely timed to bring about Mr DeWit\u2019s resignation and enable that meeting to elect a new leader, Gina Swoboda, a Trump-endorsed conservative praised by her fans for her knowledge of election law. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a text to a local political journalist, Dennis Welch, Mr DeWit complained about \u201cthe total mess that Kari caused\u201d, which had brought \u201cdivisiveness and chaos\u201d. Ms Lake now faces a backlash. At the party meeting \u201cshe was literally booed off the stage,\u201d says Sandra Dowling, a retired school superintendent who has been a Republican Party member since 1981. \u201cWhat you hear in these boos was, Kari, we\u2019re really mad at you, and we\u2019re mad at you for taking out someone we loved.\u201d Ms Dowling reckons Ms Lake has a lot of damage control to do even to win the Senate primary. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The coup leaves Arizona\u2019s Republican leadership, which was already MAGA-aligned, looking Trumpier than ever, and that could be a problem come November 5th. Republicans enjoy an advantage of about five percentage points over Democrats among registered voters in Arizona, and should win statewide elections, points out Samara Klar, a political scientist at the University of Arizona. But more than a third of voters here identify as independents, and many seem put off by Mr Trump. The party badly needs to raise money to help woo them. Democrats achieved surprising wins not only in the presidential election (Joe Biden won narrowly in 2020) but also the race for governor and both Senate seats: a trifecta not seen in Arizona for over 70 years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In office, those Democrats tend to behave like independents\u2014and often to sound like Republicans, notes Professor Klar. In the case of Senator Kyrsten Sinema, that has involved actually leaving the Democratic Party to become an independent. Whether she opts to run for re-election is one of the uncertainties hanging over this year\u2019s contest. Some doubt that she could muster the required number of signatures in time to get on the ballot. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Arizona will be getting a lot more attention from people \u201cback east\u201d. Mr Trump cancelled an appearance at what was to have been a big fund-raiser for the Arizona Republican Party in Phoenix last week. But he is expected to visit soon. Two other former presidents did make it to Arizona: George W. Bush and Bill Clinton took the stage jointly on January 31st at a conference in Scottsdale organised by TIGER 21, a network of rich people. It was a demonstration of civility in stark contrast to the strife within parties\u2014let alone between them. \u25a0"}], "id": 23}
