But satellites in such orbits move across the sky very quickly from the point of view of an Earth-bound user, zipping in and out of range of receivers on the ground. This means LEO satellite systems require antennae which can track satellites as they pass overhead, recognising when one is moving out of range and identifying and switching to another satellite that has come into the picture. Software must repeatedly facilitate these handoffs such that the user never perceives a drop in service.

If China were to attack Taiwan, starting a war that might well involve America, would Mr Musk allow Taiwan access to Starlink? All of a sudden the abstract question of who owns the internet would become a concrete geopolitical crisis. \u25a0"}], "id": 54}
