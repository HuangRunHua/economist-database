To hear American officials talk about the four-month war between Israel and Hamas, and its reverberations that claimed the lives of three American soldiers in Jordan on January 28th, there is a modest but growing chance of turning catastrophe into opportunity. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is working hard to bring it about, with senior figures shuttling between Washington, European and Middle Eastern capitals."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Their immediate aim is to secure a long humanitarian pause in the fighting, lasting a month or two, that allows for the exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. A parallel and more ambitious objective is to turn that pause into a permanent ceasefire and secure a regional peace deal. This package would comprise Israel\u2019s acceptance of a Palestinian state, Saudi Arabia\u2019s recognition of Israel, Palestinian reform and American measures to sweeten the deal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "American officials give even odds on securing the hostage deal in the coming weeks. If it succeeds, they reckon the broader agreement then has a similar chance. They are operating under two clocks. First, they want to calm the situation before Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting. It starts around March 10th and is often a time of heightened religious passion and violence. Second, they think the best opportunity to secure regional peace is before America\u2019s presidential election in November. They also know that the danger of uncontrolled escalation is ever present.

About 250 hostages were seized. Israel\u2019s military campaign to crush Hamas has destroyed much of Gaza and killed almost 27,000 Palestinians (including fighters).

The idf reckons it has destroyed 60-70% of the group\u2019s battalions. But the intense fighting in Khan Younis is evidence that it is far from defeated. The fact that Hamas can still fire the odd rocket at Israeli cities from northern Gaza, where the idf has thinned out its forces, suggests it can reconstitute itself. It is not just Mr Netanyahu, but much of the war cabinet that has pleaded for more time to deal with Hamas."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But some figures are starting to shift. Gadi Eisenkot, a member of the war cabinet and a former idf chief of staff whose son and nephew were killed fighting in Gaza, has said that talk of total victory and rescuing the hostages by military means amounted to \u201ctall tales\u201d; securing the release of captives was more important than continuing the fight. \u201cThe enemy can be killed afterwards,\u201d he said.

The temporary became permanent as security collapsed during the second intifada of 2000-05. Israel left Gaza, and Hamas expelled the pa from the enclave in 2007. Divided and weak, the Palestinians were largely ignored. Instead America promoted the Abraham accords, instigated by the Trump administration, under which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (uae), then Morocco and Sudan, established diplomatic ties with Israel in 2020-23.

The Biden administration talks more pointedly now about the need for a \u201ccredible, irreversible and time-bound\u201d Israeli commitment to a Palestinian state.

A defence treaty would require ratification by a two-thirds majority in the Senate\u2014this in a Congress that struggles to agree on anything, notably Mr Biden\u2019s request for more money to help Ukraine, Israel and others. Nonetheless, a deal done this year under Mr Biden ought to secure bipartisan support, even if some left-wing Democrats and isolationist Republicans oppose it.

The Israeli prime minister has ruled out a Palestinian state, saying Israel must have security control over all lands between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean.

His far-right allies are recycling ideas of the \u201ctransfer\u201d of Gazans to other countries, or at least a return of Jewish settlements to Gaza.

Israeli officials do not exclude the possibility that Mr Netanyahu may be more forthcoming than he sounds. Few world leaders trust him, though. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hamas, for its part, has a history of undermining peace efforts through violence. Its revised charter rejects the Oslo accords and commits itself to \u201carmed resistance\u201d against Zionism. Some diplomats reckon exiled Hamas leaders in Qatar might be biddable. But Mr Sinwar is a hardliner and has become a heroic resistance figure to many Arabs. Israeli officials say he ultimately has only two options: die fighting or go into exile. It seems unlikely that he would emulate Yasser Arafat, the late Palestinian father-figure, who went to Tunis after Israel besieged him in Beirut in 1982. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Sinwar is said to be signalling via Egypt that Hamas is not interested in retaking administrative control of the Gaza Strip.

At most, they will provide short-term humanitarian aid.

In the meantime Israel is telling the Americans it can get by with local potentates\u2014clan leaders or businessmen, say\u2014running particular districts under overall Israeli control.
