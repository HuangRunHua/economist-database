When covid-19 hits in 2020, you do not have the money to escape to a second home in the Hamptons or the Hudson Valley. Instead, in the evening you make your way up to the rooftop of your building, where, to your surprise, other tenants have come, too. You do not know most of them, but after some awkwardness, everyone starts meeting nightly, drinks in hand, to share stories about family, music, September 11th, love and, equally\u2014inevitably\u2014death."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is the premise of \u201cFourteen Days\u201d, a \u201ccollaborative novel\u201d edited by Margaret Atwood (of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d fame) and Douglas Preston (author of \u201cThe Lost City of the Monkey God\u201d). In addition to Ms Atwood and Mr Preston, 34 notable authors of varied genres and backgrounds contributed to the book, including James Shapiro, a playwright, and the novelists Emma Donoghue, Dave Eggers and John Grisham. Reading \u201cFourteen Days\u201d is like sitting by a campfire, with characters taking turns telling tales about their lives. (This conceit is helpful, given the number of collaborators. The book\u2019s plot is simple, so each character\u2019s story can stand on its own.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFourteen Days\u201d is one of a growing number of new works, both fictional and factual, which are written collaboratively in some way. Stewart Brand, a writer and futurist from California, is working on a book entitled \u201cMaintenance: Of Everything\u201d, which allows early readers to comment on draft chapters. In January Audrey Tang, Taiwan\u2019s minister of digital affairs, and Glen Weyl, a noted economist and co-founder of the RadicalxChange Foundation, a group of activists, signed a contract to write a book, entitled \u201cPlurality\u201d, on digital democracy together with dozens of contributors. AI services, such as ChatGPT, have started to become co-authors, too. A more collective approach to authorship is on the rise."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is a rich history of collaboration in writing. Just think of the Bible or the \u201cKalevala\u201d, a Finnish epic, which were both written by many hands. Homer, if he was in fact a single person, probably synthesised bits of oral poetry for his \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cOdyssey\u201d. In the Renaissance plays had many authors, who often added new characters as they saw fit. Only after the invention of the printing press in the mid-15th century did books became a business. Single-author books proved easier to market, and the \u201cmyth of the solitary author\u201d established itself, says Scott Rettberg, who leads the Centre for Digital Narrative at the University of Bergen in Norway. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the 20th century collective authorship made something of a comeback. In the 1960s the idea re-emerged for all sorts of reasons, including as a counteroffensive against cultural conventions. In 1969 two dozen journalists wrote \u201cNaked Came the Stranger\u201d, a deliberately terrible book poking fun at American literary standards. (It became a surprise bestseller.) In the 1990s new technological possibilities prompted writers to work together\u2014or, more accurately, to link to each other. A noted example is \u201cHypertext Hotel\u201d, a collaborative writing space built online in 1991 by Robert Coover, an American experimental novelist, which uses a spatial metaphor to weave stories together. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chances are, your bookshelf contains an example of a literary collaboration, say by Lee Child, who wrote some of the \u201cJack Reacher\u201d series with his brother, Andrew, or James Patterson, whose bibliography of co-authors reads like a name-dropper\u2019s address book. \u201cFourteen Days\u201d nods to this history of collaborative writing. In their foreword Ms Atwood and Mr Preston cite the influence of \u201cThe Decameron\u201d (1353) by Giovanni Boccaccio, a collection of stories about a small group of people who shelter in a villa near Florence to escape the bubonic plague. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even if these projects do not blaze new trails, it is clear that something is different. The tools to write together have improved in recent years. Mr Brand publishes his draft chapters on Books in Progress, a website with a user-friendly commenting tool. He celebrates Google Docs: its features make co-authoring extremely easy. (Economist writers and editors are avid users.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "What Mr Weyl and Ms Tang are attempting is more novel. They intend to employ tools of the kind typically used to develop open-source software to co-ordinate their contributors and even \u201chelp them find a single authorial voice\u201d, says Mr Weyl. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Their point of departure is Microsoft\u2019s GitHub, a website that helps coders collaborate on open-source projects. But they have also added features, such as voting, to make it easier for contributors to agree on wording. Participants can earn a digital currency by doing tasks, too. This rewards their participation (and can be used to determine their share of revenue the book may earn). This set-up is meant to create the right incentives, bribing people to do boring tasks like fixing typos and line editing."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Readers have become accustomed to collectively created works, Mr Brand argues: \u201cWe\u2019re already living in a more interactive collaborative mode.\u201d Social media has conditioned people to multi-author texts. Many have even contributed to collective works, such as Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. But there are also all sorts of manuals, textbooks and writers\u2019 groups for fan fiction, where people add and comment on new twists to existing works. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Generative AI will add more to the mix. It is not just that the algorithms powering services like ChatGPT are themselves collective works of sorts (trained on huge amounts of text scraped from the internet). Such models are also conversational machines, which can suggest phrases, give feedback and answer questions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cCyborg authorship\u201d is what Mr Rettberg of the University of Bergen calls this. He already has more than one tech-supported writing project under his belt (and recently co-curated an exhibition of books written with the help of AI at the University of California, Berkeley, called \u201cMore Than Meets AI\u201d). He published a book jointly with colleagues, in which ChatGPT is invoked to generate reviews of famous works in the style of well-known authors\u2014think Jane Austen writing about William Burroughs\u2019s \u201cNaked Lunch\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Writing with collaborators, be they human or artificial, will only become more common. But individual authors will still dominate creatively.

Recently Kudan Rie, the winner of Japan\u2019s top prize for literature, admitted she used ChatGPT to write around 5% of her science-fiction novel \u201cTokyo Sympathy Tower\u201d. Such candidness is rare. Most would never admit to using AI.
