Theatregoers in Beijing have been mulling that question, with two new stage adaptations exploring themes of injustice, freedom and renewal. \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d (pictured) is set in mid-20th-century America, while \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d takes place in 19th-century France. Both feature characters who are unjustly imprisoned and suffer under cruel jailers and corrupt systems."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The plays, performed in Mandarin, might seem a bit too on the nose for Chinese censors. After all, the Communist Party has been known to play the role of cruel jailer in real life. The party also disputes the notion that freedom and human rights are universal values. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d, based on a novella by Stephen King, was made into an award-winning film in 1994. Though it was not shown in Chinese cinemas, it became hugely popular with locals who bought bootleg VHS or DVD copies. It also caught the attention of censors. In 2012 a blind human-rights lawyer called Chen Guangcheng pulled off a daring night-time escape from house arrest in the village of Dongshigu. (He ended up in America.) This gave rise to chatter about the \u201cDongshigu Redemption\u201d\u2014and led the government to block online searches for \u201cShawshank\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2019 \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d, which is based on a novel by Victor Hugo, got similar treatment. This came after pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong adopted as their anthem a tune from the musical version of the story. The song, \u201cDo You Hear the People Sing?\u201d, was subsequently censored."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet people involved in the Chinese stage productions of \u201cShawshank\u201d and \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d report no problems gaining approval. This is not all that surprising. Censors worry less about plays than films or online content, which can be shared widely. Another factor is the foreign settings of the works, which make their messages easier to dismiss by Chinese officials. The production of \u201cShawshank\u201d even has a foreign cast (all of whom speak Mandarin)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Chinese theatregoers are not being obtuse. \u201cOf course you start to think China is a bit like the prison,\u201d says an audience member at the Beijing premiere of \u201cShawshank\u201d. One of its stars is Mark Rowswell, a Canadian who has enjoyed fame in China under the stage name Da Shan. He admits that the play veers into sensitive territory. \u201cSure, it\u2019s about a corrupt system that makes you think you\u2019re trapped and you\u2019ll never get out,\u201d he says. \u201cBut really, it\u2019s mostly about hope.
