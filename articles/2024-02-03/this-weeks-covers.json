In Britain, America, the Middle East and Africa, we put the conflict in the Middle East on our cover. In the months after Hamas committed the worst atrocity against Jews since the Holocaust, fighting has spread across the region. With ten countries now caught up in the fighting, it is easy to despair. But there is a way out.

This matters, because social media are how people experience the internet. When platforms swing back towards private groups, they inevitably have less oversight. When people escape their echo chambers, they may well face more extreme content. When users embrace harmless entertainment, they see less news.
