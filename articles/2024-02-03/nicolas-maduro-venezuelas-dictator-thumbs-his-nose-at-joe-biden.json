That is especially true were he to face Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a popular conservative leader who won the opposition primary last October with 92% of the vote. One poll in November found that 70% of those surveyed said they would elect her, with just 9% supporting Mr Maduro. So it came as little surprise when, on January 27th, a Supreme Court stuffed with his cronies ratified a ban on Ms Machado seeking any political office for 15 years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The move was swiftly justified by spokesmen spouting the regime\u2019s twisted logic. Prohibiting the country\u2019s most popular politician from being on the ballot papers was nothing other than a valiant defence of democracy, they insisted. \u201cWe want elections which are competitive for everyone, free for all,\u201d claimed Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, the head of the government\u2019s rubber-stamp National Assembly. He then added that there was no way \u201cthat woman\u201d would ever be a candidate. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is just the latest example of Mr Maduro thumbing his nose at the United States. In October President Joe Biden\u2019s administration lifted sanctions for six months on most of the country\u2019s oil, mining and gold sectors in exchange for the regime agreeing, with members of the opposition, to a deal signed in Barbados which includes releasing political prisoners and holding broadly democratic elections this year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since then a handful of prisoners have been freed. But democracy remains elusive in the rogue state. In December Mr Maduro held a dodgy referendum which he claimed gave him the remit to annex two-thirds of neighbouring Guyana, a move designed to create geopolitical headaches. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On January 29th, in response to Ms Machado\u2019s ban, the US Department of the Treasury announced the reimposition of one sanction. American companies transacting with Venezuela\u2019s state-owned mining company, Minerven, would have until February 13th to disentangle themselves from it. The big question now is: will Mr Biden have the mettle to impose more noteworthy sanctions, such as on the oil sector, on April 18th, the deadline for Mr Maduro to play ball?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Machado believes in free markets and calls Margaret Thatcher a hero. That makes her unusual in Venezuela, a socialist state which has been ruled by Mr Maduro since 2013 and, before that, by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, his political mentor. She used to be seen as the hardline fringe of the opposition, and as recently as 2018 tweeted that the only way to rid the country of Mr Maduro\u2019s regime was not via the ballot, but \u201cby force\u201d. She now argues that elections can bring about change. She has also repeatedly said that Mr Maduro runs a \u201cterrorist regime\u201d and should \u201cface justice\u201d for crimes he has committed against humanity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even before the Supreme Court decision, Ms Machado was banned from office on the grounds that she failed to declare some assets when she was a congresswoman (an allegation she says is baseless). Justifying its latest ruling, the Supreme Court cited various reasons, including the fact that she had expressed support for American sanctions. The court also confirmed a similar ban on Henrique Capriles, another opposition politician. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indeed, despite the Barbados deal, the regime is taking a harder-line stance against its perceived enemies. On January 22nd it announced that 32 people had been arrested for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mr Maduro and Vlad\u00edmir Padrino, the defence minister. Detention warrants were issued for a further 14 \u201csuspects\u201d including Tamara Suj\u00fa, a human-rights activist, and Sebastiana Barr\u00e1ez, a journalist, both of whom live abroad. Three of Ms Machado\u2019s campaign directors were detained earlier this month. The government has said it is unleashing what it has described as \u201cFuria Bolivariana\u201d: a \u201cfury\u201d in the name of the country\u2019s 19th-century independence hero, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240203_AMC232.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Others see it as sheer pragmatism. \u201cAllowing Machado to stand was never a possibility in this situation, where the government sets the rules,\u201d says Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, a pollster. He thinks that Ms Machado\u2019s past threats of retaliation meant her candidacy was a non-starter. Given that Mr Maduro\u2019s regime survived an escalation in sanctions under Donald Trump (see chart), it seems it is calculating that it can withstand sanctions once more. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Maduro has used the past few months to consolidate his power further. His regime has more leverage over the United States. On January 30th Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the vice-president, tweeted that if America snapped back an embargo, Venezuela would stop taking repatriated Venezuelan migrants, record numbers of whom arrived in the United States last year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile the deal in Barbados led to a prisoner swap whereby an ally of Mr Maduro, Alex Saab, a Colombian businessman who faced charges in the United States for allegedly helping the regime launder $350m, was granted clemency by Mr Biden and returned to Venezuela. He now runs Venezuela\u2019s international investment centre. Mr Saab was arrested in 2020 in Cape Verde, during a refuelling pit-stop when on the way to Iran. The Iranian regime has helped Venezuela\u2019s, by buying gold, and it could do so again. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even so, the return of sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s oil sector would still be a big financial hit. It would mean that the regime would again have to resort to selling its oil at as much as a 40% discount on the black market, at an estimated loss of $500m per month in a country where GDP was just $92bn last year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One possible compromise being suggested in Caracas, the capital, is that Ms Machado withdraws her candidacy and supports a non-banned candidate. But the opposition leader, whose political mantra is Hasta el final (Until the end), emphatically dismissed that option on January 29th. \u201cThere is no retreat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a mandate.
