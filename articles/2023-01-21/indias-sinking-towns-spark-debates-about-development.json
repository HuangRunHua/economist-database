Satellite imagery suggests the area sank by more than 5cm (2 inches) in 12 days during the new year period, having already subsided by 9cm between April and November last year. The district stopped all construction, declared hundreds of houses unsafe and moved their inhabitants, including Mr Saklani and his family, to temporary accommodation. The five of them are now living in one hotel room. The government has given them 150,000 rupees ($1,800) in compensation.

Melting glaciers have since left behind more loose material which has pushed up the dangers, says Sarswati Prakash Sati, a geologist from Uttarakhand.
