In a Kafkaesque touch, no president has actually lived there in decades. On January 13th and 14th eight candidates vied to become the castle\u2019s next official occupant, and in another Kafkaesque touch, none of them won. Andrej Babis, an oligarch who served as prime minister until the autumn of 2021, and Petr Pavel, a retired general, finished neck-and-neck in the first round of the election. With the second round scheduled for January 27th and 28th, Mr Babis has unleashed a viciously negative campaign. It will be a \u201cuniquely disgusting\u201d two weeks, predicts Karel Schwarzenberg, a former Czech foreign minister who ran for president in 2013 and now backs Mr Pavel."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is the Czech Republic\u2019s third direct presidential election: a constitutional change in 2012 scrapped the previous system, a parliamentary process prone to back-room deals. Fully 68% of voters turned out. The candidates included Danuse Nerudova, an academic who hoped to become the country\u2019s first female president, and Jaroslav Basta, a far-right populist. Mr Pavel got 35.4% of the vote, Mr Babis exactly 35%. Ms Nerudova, whom polls had shown doing well, unexpectedly finished a distant third with 13.9%. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The president is head of state, but has limited powers. They include appointing judges on the constitutional court and board members of the central bank. Most presidents, including Vaclav Havel, a former anti-communist dissident, have been circumspect. But the incumbent, Milos Zeman, a hard-drinking populist who weathered several impeachment attempts, stretched the limits of his mandate. He meddled in foreign policy and flaunted his sympathies for Russia and China. (He changed his pro-Russian stance only after Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Zeman backs Mr Babis. The former prime minister got a boost a few days before the election, when he was acquitted in a long-running fraud trial related to \u20ac2m ($2.2m) in EU subsidies to one of his businesses. Petr Fiala, the current centre-right prime minister who beat Mr Babis in 2021, is tacitly backing Mr Pavel, who promises to back progressive social policies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Otto Eibl, a political scientist, says Mr Babis plays on voters\u2019 fears of inflation and the war in Ukraine. As prime minister he led the country poorly during the pandemic. An admirer of Donald Trump, he handed out MAGA-style red baseball caps emblazoned with the slogan \u201cStrong Czechia\u201d. He embraces anti-immigrant policies and fostered close ties with Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s populist leader."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rural, less-educated and poorer Czechs are drawn to Mr Babis\u2019s populism. Urban, educated, better-off and younger voters backed Mr Pavel or Ms Nerudova in the first round. Many of Ms Nerudova\u2019s voters will switch to Mr Pavel. Mr Babis, who owns two newspapers and the country\u2019s biggest commercial-radio station, kicked off his mudslinging right after the first round\u2019s results were announced. He insinuated that Mr Pavel was a spy and compared him to Mr Putin. He also claimed that he had hailed the Red Army\u2019s invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968; Mr Pavel was seven years old at the time. Mr Babis later apologised."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dirty campaigns are not new to Czech politics. In the presidential campaign of 2008 conservatives attacked Jan Svejnar, a liberal, for having a non-Czech-speaking wife. In the run-up to a parliamentary election in 2021, Mr Babis called the rival Pirate Party a \u201cpro-migrant neo-communist group\u201d. No doubt he has similar lines in store for Mr Pavel.\u25a0"}], "id": 43}
