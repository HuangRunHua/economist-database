By Janet Malcolm. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 176 pages; $26. Granta; \u00a314.99"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Janet Malcolm was a journalist who famously compared journalists to con men, \u201cpreying on people\u2019s vanity, ignorance or loneliness\u2026and betraying them without remorse.\u201d She was a biographer who skewered the \u201cvoyeurism and busybodyism\u201d of biographies. In her books and articles, mostly for the New Yorker, Malcolm used her pen like a knife, trimming fat and gutting pieties. She died in 2021, but her distinctive voice lives on in the syllabuses of writing classes around the world. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "With \u201cStill Pictures\u201d, Malcolm has published a kind of posthumous memoir (though she never would have called it that). Given her critique of the biases inherent in storytelling, and her insights into the ways individuals use stories to obscure what is unknown and unknowable about the self, however could she indulge in that most warped and self-serving genre of them all? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The essays that make up this book all start with the kind of old and unremarkable personal photos that occupy dusty shoe boxes. In an afterword, Anne Malcolm reminds readers that her mother was once the New Yorker\u2019s photography critic, but Malcolm\u2019s observations are not really about the images. Rather, she uses the photos to consider the porousness of memory, the way the mind often seizes and distorts some details while misplacing others. \u201cMost of what happens to us goes unremembered,\u201d she writes. This makes autobiography a kind of \u201cnovelistic enterprise\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Given Malcolm\u2019s preoccupation with psychoanalysis, it is fitting that she spends much of the book revisiting the haze of childhood. She recounts how her Jewish family fled the Nazis in Prague in 1939 and made a home among fellow Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9s in New York. Malcolm\u2019s father worked as a doctor, changed their surname from Wiener to Winn and helped them become the kind of \u201cordinary middle class, middlebrow family\u201d that subscribed to the Book-of-the-Month Club and cooked casseroles with Campbell\u2019s cream-of-mushroom soup. (\u201cDoes anyone say \u2018casserole\u2019 anymore?\u201d) Malcolm internalised the city\u2019s anti-Semitism before her parents told her she was Jewish, so she \u201cresented and hid\u201d this detail about herself for much of her youth."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As a memoirist, Malcolm comes clean about her gaps in memory and her lapses in judgment, and she has characteristically strong feelings about what is moral and appropriate. In writing about her father, for example, Malcolm explains that she is sticking to \u201clovely plotless memories\u201d about him, as the memories with a plot are invariably those of \u201cconflict, resentment, blame, self-justification\u2014and it is wrong, unfair, inexcusable to publish them.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her take on her mother is more complicated. Malcolm writes that she was \u201cwarm and loving and unselfish\u201d, roasting squab and baking profiteroles for her two daughters whenever they fell ill. But her mother could also be needy and volatile\u2014she \u201callowed herself her histrionics\u201d\u2014with a vivacity that perhaps masked \u201can inner deadness of spirit\u201d. It is a compelling portrait, even if it doesn\u2019t quite cohere. As Malcom writes: \u201cDo we ever write about our parents without perpetrating a fraud?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Malcolm overlooks her first marriage and touches only briefly on her second. She worked at the New Yorker for almost 60 years, yet her account of her career is dominated by the decade she spent defending herself from accusations of libel brought by one of her subjects. She laments her initial reaction to the lawsuit, which was to say nothing in her defence \u201cin dogged accord with the magazine\u2019s stance of unrelenting hauteur\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The book\u2019s most charming moments are when the incisive, unsparing adult can be found in the child. About a kindly Czech couple who were friends with her parents, Malcolm writes that their dullness \u201cbrought out an obnoxiousness in my sister and me for which I would blush today if I were a better person. But a child\u2019s cruelty is never completely outgrown.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 83}
