But let\u2019s be clear: Indians are not Asians,\u201d he declared. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The segment provoked a minor backlash in America. But some viewers in Asia nodded along, for Mr Chieng\u2019s tongue-in-cheek rant struck at something they recognised. For centuries the people of the region\u2019s western and southern parts and those of the east and south-east have struggled to make sense of each other. That struggle is at the heart of \u201cHow Asia Found Herself\u201d, a new book by a historian, Nile Green, who teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The term Asia was coined by Greek geographers some two millennia ago and did not appear on the continent it described until the 1600s, at the dawn of the age of European empire. The foreign roots of the word\u2014and the concept\u2014are visible in the transliterations that Asians made as they grappled with the idea: Asiya in Arabic, Persian and Urdu; Esiya in Bengali and Gujarati; Ajia in Japanese; Yaxiya in Chinese. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It took until the 19th century for the term to catch on, and even then its most salient use was oppositional: Asia as an anti-colonial device, as \u201cnot Europe\u201d. Even the \u201cAsian values\u201d promoted by Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s founder, are best understood in opposition to Western ones. The irony, as Mr Green notes, is that it was European colonial infrastructure that in many cases made inter-Asian cultural exchange possible, whether through steamship routes that opened up the ports of the Indo-Pacific to traders, missionaries and intellectuals, or, more notably, through European languages that served as a bridge between the vast number of Asian tongues. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As late as the 20th century there were few dictionaries between major Asian languages such as Japanese, Urdu, Chinese and Persian, let alone between minor ones. Sometimes this led to comic outcomes. When Baha\u2019i missionaries sought to convert Japanese in 1914, they resorted to the use of Esperanto, a language invented in Poland in 1887. Similarly, indigenous literature on other Asian cultures was scant, requiring scholars to look to English, French or Russian sources."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When intellectuals from across the continent chose to engage with the idea of Asia as something that united them, it was often as a form of self-projection. Chinese intellectuals looked upon India, whose people had been unable to fight off colonisation, as a lesson in how not to fail. Indians speculated on the influence of ancient Hindu scriptures on Daoism, or of India\u2019s warrior caste on Japan\u2019s samurai. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Asian Muslims attempted to reconcile the new (to them) religions of Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism and Shinto with their own faith, casting the Buddha as an Islamic prophet or Confucius as a philosopher. Japan\u2019s Asianists saw their own country as a natural leader, notably through the imperialist project of a continental \u201cco-prosperity sphere\u201d. Acceptance of the idea of Asia did not automatically lead to a sense of brotherhood or respect. As Mr Green writes, \u201cthe search for solidarity always raised the question: unity on whose terms?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the 1930s an Indian freedom fighter, Rash Behari Bose (who married a Japanese woman and would die a Japanese citizen), proposed to the proto-Hindu-nationalist Veer Savarkar that \u201cevery attempt should be made to create a Hindu bloc extending from the Indian Ocean up to the Pacific Ocean.\u201d Some 70 years later Abe Shinzo, then prime minister of Japan, extolled to India\u2019s parliament the idea of a \u201cbroader Asia\u201d taking shape \u201cat the confluence of the two seas of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\u201d.
