Mortality in Europe is about 10% higher than expected in a normal year. In mid-December French and German deaths were a quarter higher. The chaos is also damaging in ways that cannot be measured.

The trouble is that \u201call-time high\u201d does not necessarily mean \u201cenough\u201d. Ageing populations increase demand. Health-care systems compete for staff with other parts of the economy, so doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 wages must keep pace with prevailing rates of pay. Costs rise even if health-care productivity stagnates. The unforgiving logic of this \u201ccost disease\u201d means that in ageing societies health-care spending must usually grow as a share of the economy just to maintain a given level of provision. Countries, such as Britain and Italy, that in the years before the covid-19 pandemic cut health-care spending as a share of gdp, or held it constant, were already on a path to worse services. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet squeezed budgets do not fully explain the disarray. Even in places with ample funding, health care is struggling with the unprecedented effects of the pandemic. On the demand side, covid has left behind sicker populations. After years of avoiding flu, many people are now getting it. The world is also discovering some of the costs of lockdowns. In 2020-21 many hospitals and family doctors cancelled appointments for non-covid conditions. People who postponed treatment for other maladies are presenting with later-stage illnesses that need more expensive treatment; they also have poorer chances of recovery. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Covid hits the supply side, too. Many hospitals continue to isolate covid-positive patients and maintain strict cleaning regimes. This eats up time and resources. In addition, staff are burned out. The result seems to have been a decline in productivity.

More money would make little immediate difference. It takes time to hire staff and vacancies are already high. But it may be possible to boost productivity by winding down anti-covid measures that are unnecessary in mostly vaccinated populations. Beyond this year, spare capacity is needed. Governments that cannot find ways to boost productivity will have no choice but to increase funding and therefore raise taxes. Reforms that were already desirable, such as streamlining processes or introducing more competition, may come to be essential.
