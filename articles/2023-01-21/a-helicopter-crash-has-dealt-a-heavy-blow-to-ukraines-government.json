Vera threw herself against one of the walls of their flat and prayed. \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky, I will survive,\u201d she recalls thinking. Yet the explosion that shook Brovary seconds later was from a Ukrainian helicopter, which struck a kindergarten outside their apartment block, then crashed into another building about a hundred metres away. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The crash took the lives of at least 14 people, including Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky; his first deputy, Yevhen Yenin; other senior ministry officials aboard the helicopter; and a child on the ground. Over twenty others are believed to be injured. Mr Monastyrsky is the most senior Ukrainian official to have been killed since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion. At an extraordinary meeting today, the country\u2019s cabinet appointed Ihor Klymenko, the head of the national police, as his temporary replacement. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The cause of the crash remains unknown, although poor visibility may have played a part. Witnesses say there was heavy fog over Brovary at the time. Ukraine\u2019s Security Service said its investigators were looking into technical malfunction, breach of air-traffic rules or sabotage as possible causes. The crash started a fire in the kindergarten; flames were shooting out of the roof, says Yuri, who ran to help survivors."}, {"role": "body", "imageURL": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISAq6nT77Vg", "imageWidth": "640", "imageHeight": "360", "imageDescription": "", "text": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The loss of the leadership of one of Ukraine\u2019s security ministries will have an immediate effect on the war effort. Mr Monastyrsky\u2019s ministry was responsible for co-ordinating the national guard, border-guard service, police, emergency services and part of the country\u2019s territorial-defence forces. Much of these structures worked autonomously, with their own managers. But some of the processes were personalised, so the death of senior officials entails the loss of institutional memory. Many questions are being asked about the wisdom of placing the minister, his first deputy and the ministry\u2019s leading civil servant on one helicopter."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Monastyrsky, 42, was an important player in the country\u2019s National Security and Defence Council, though he had been in his post only since July 2021. He succeeded Arsen Avakov, an influential figure, following a power struggle between the interior minister and presidency. Mr Monastyrsky was seen as a compromise appointment: an MP of President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s party on the one hand, but also someone with close connections to Mr Avakov. Mr Avakov had in the past courted controversy by allowing members of far-right fringe groups into law enforcement. Some suspect he may seek to return to the ministry as Ukraine looks for a permanent replacement for Mr Monastyrsky."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst based in Kyiv, said it was unlikely Mr Zelensky would offer him the chance. The former interior minister is too much his own man, and is still unamused at being pushed out of his post, he said: \u201cZelensky will be looking to keep unity at all costs.\u201d \u25a0"}]}
