Lula, as he is known, sobbed as he talked about the large and growing number of Brazilians struggling with hunger. \u201cIf at the end of my term in 2026, every Brazilian is having breakfast, lunch and dinner once again,\u201d he said, \u201cI will have fulfilled my life\u2019s mission.\u201d At his inauguration in January, he broke down once again and reiterated that his government\u2019s \u201cfirst action\u201d will be to rescue millions from malnutrition."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As Marcelo Neri, an economist, puts it, if China is the world\u2019s factory, Brazil is the world\u2019s farm. The country is the world\u2019s largest exporter of beef and the second-largest exporter of grain. Yet despite the bounty, millions of Brazilians are not getting enough to eat. Partly because of the war in Ukraine, food prices have increased so quickly recently that families who considered themselves solidly middle-class a few years ago are now struggling to put food on the table."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The share of the population that is hungry has jumped from 9%, or about 19m people, at the end of 2020 to over 15%, or 33m people, in 2022, according to the Brazilian Research Network on Food and Nutrition Sovereignty and Security (PENSSAN), a non-profit organisation. The number that face some form of food insecurity\u2014for example, skipping meals or opting for lower-quality food\u2014is around 125m. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The last time Lula was president, from 2003 to 2010, he got some way towards his goal. One campaign, \u201cZero Hunger\u201d, which was launched in his first 30 days in office, became a model for other developing countries. Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, the world\u2019s biggest conditional cash-transfer scheme, ensured families did not starve. By 2010 47m students got healthy free school meals. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The effects were obvious almost immediately. The share of the population that was undernourished fell by half, from around 8% in 2003 to just 4% in 2010, according to the World Bank. A generation grew up with better prospects as fewer children were distracted by rumbling stomachs at school. In 2014 Brazil dropped off the UN Hunger Map, which includes countries where at least 5% of the population face serious food insecurity. But those gains were short-lived. A commodities boom, which boosted growth and funded Lula\u2019s social programmes, came to a crashing halt in 2015. Economic mismanagement by his handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, did not help. GDP per person fell by 8% from 2014 to 2016, leaving millions jobless and unable to feed their families.

Under Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who was elected in 2018, the hungry were initially a low priority. In 2011 Mr Bolsonaro, then a congressman, called Bolsa Fam\u00edlia\u2019s beneficiaries \u201cignorant wretches\u201d. During covid-19, however, he launched a cash-transfer programme that helped many. But these handouts were not enough to stave off hunger for the poorest. Inflation is easing but the prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks were up by more than 11% year-on-year in December."}, {"role": "body", "text": "People from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro are turning up at state hospitals with minor ailments, hoping to be checked in just so they get a hot meal, says Rodrigo Afonso of A\u00e7\u00e3o da Cidadania, a charity.

So far, it looks like the new president and his Workers\u2019 Party will manage to keep their promise to bring hunger down.

"}, {"role": "second", "text": "More on the menu"}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Lula may have a harder time pushing through other pro-poor policies. He won the presidential vote with the narrowest margin\u20141.9 percentage points\u2014since Brazil\u2019s return to democracy in the 1980s. He faces a Congress dominated by conservatives. And the government is desperately short of funds. Among G20 countries Brazil had one of the most generous fiscal responses to the pandemic. Congress declared a \u201cstate of calamity\u201d to bypass a constitutional ceiling on spending, allowing gross public debt to climb to a peak of 88% of GDP in late 2020."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hunger is not the only thing Lula has to worry about. The country has a productivity problem, too. Even in the commodities boom output per worker grew on average at just 1% each year, according to Capital Economics, a consultancy. Analysts expect that output will expand by less than 1% in 2023. Since the election, the government\u2019s borrowing costs have ticked up as lenders worry about soaring spending on social protection. The president faces a tricky balancing act. \u25a0"}]}
