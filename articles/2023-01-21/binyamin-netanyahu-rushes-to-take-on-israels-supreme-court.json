Much attention has been paid to the far right and ultra-religious parties in his coalition, which have won control of big ministries. But the appointment of Yariv Levin, a member of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, as justice minister may have the most profound effect on Israeli democracy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Levin is determined to curb the powers of the country\u2019s robustly independent Supreme Court. The new minister wants to introduce an \u201coverride clause\u201d which would allow a simple majority in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, to pass laws deemed unconstitutional by the court. Under his plans the court would no longer be able to nullify government decisions on the ground of \u201creasonableness\u201d. Politicians would appoint judges. The government\u2019s legal advisers, currently an independent group, would be replaced with political appointees. A ruling by the Supreme Court on January 18th, blocking the appointment of one of the new government\u2019s senior ministers because of his conviction for tax fraud, has exacerbated matters."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Israel\u2019s lack of a formal constitution and its unicameral proportional-representation election system, which usually leads to coalitions with a number of small but politically powerful special-interest parties, mean its Supreme Court has long been highly interventionist. Israeli politicians of all stripes have bridled at the court\u2019s reach. Israel\u2019s founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion of the centre-left Labour party, skipped the Supreme Court\u2019s opening. The new Netanyahu government is made up largely of politicians who object, on principle, to the interventions of unelected judges. They are adamant that they are upholding true democracy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Israel\u2019s judges disagree. On January 12th Esther Hayut, the president of the Supreme Court, in a rare public criticism of government policy, called Mr Levin\u2019s plan \u201ca mortal wound to the independence of the judiciary\u201d. Were it to pass, said Ms Hayut, it would \u201cchange the democratic identity of the country beyond recognition\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The changes would mean the removal of any checks on the government\u2019s power, argues Suzie Navot, a constitutional lawyer and vice-president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a think-tank. The plan has rejuvenated the fragmented centre-left opposition. On January 14th around 80,000 protesters gathered in Tel Aviv and other cities to fight the government\u2019s plans. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Netanyahu is undeterred. The following day he described the election in November as \u201cthe mother of all protests\u201d and claimed millions had voted to reform the legal system. \u201cWe are not even touching the Supreme Court\u2019s powers of administrative review,\u201d insists the chairman of the Knesset\u2019s law committee, Simcha Rothman, a member of Religious Zionism, a far-right bloc. He ridicules cries that these changes will make Israel less democratic. He claims that no other court in the world uses a comparable \u201creasonableness\u201d test, or vets its appointments in the manner of the Israeli one."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the past the independence of Israel\u2019s legal system has allowed it to hold the government, as well as the country\u2019s leaders, to account. One former prime minister was convicted of corruption. A president was jailed for sexual assault. Mr Netanyahu himself is facing charges of bribery and fraud. The proposed changes would not affect his case directly, but it is hard to avoid the impression that he has returned to office with a score to settle with the judges. Mr Netanyahu once presented himself as a champion of the Supreme Court\u2019s independence. Whether he has genuinely changed his mind or done so for political expediency, that position no longer suits him. \u25a0"}]}
