Mursal Nabizada, an activist and former parliamentarian, chose to stay. Afghanistan, as she put it, was not like a restaurant you can leave if you do not like the service. It was her home."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In mid-January Ms Nabizada was shot dead in Kabul, the capital. It is not yet clear who killed her. But her murder provides another appalling glimpse of how life in Afghanistan is deteriorating\u2014for women and girls in particular. Under the Taliban, people who mistreat or attack women have much less reason to fear punishment. \u201cThe gloves have come off,\u201d reckons Ashley Jackson of the Centre on Armed Groups, an NGO based in Geneva. \u201cAnyone can do anything to a woman.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the Taliban\u2019s first press conference after seizing power a spokesman announced that women would be \u201cvery active\u201d in Afghan society. There was some hope that \u201cTaliban 2.0\u201d would set itself apart from the brutish regime that ran the country from 1996 to 2001. But moderate voices are being drowned out by diehard mullahs in Kandahar, the group\u2019s southern stronghold.

Bosses in Kandahar apparently ordered that reversal at the last minute. Since then, new rules have forced women to cover their faces in public, sought to ban them from going out without a male escort, and barred them from parks and gyms (how strictly these rules are enforced varies around the country). In the past month alone, the Taliban has ruled that women may not attend university and may not work for NGOs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These edicts are impoverishing the country. The UN thinks the share of households for whom humanitarian assistance is the main source of income has increased six-fold since 2021. Across the country some 20m people are at risk of severe hunger.

But confusion over whether and how women are permitted to work for such organisations is stopping assistance getting to people who need it. Female aid workers are indispensable in places where women are loth to let unknown men into their homes, or to discuss topics such as their health.
