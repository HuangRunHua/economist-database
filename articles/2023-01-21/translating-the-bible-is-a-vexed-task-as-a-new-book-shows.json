You may be able to work out a new gadget\u2019s instructions even if they are garbled. If the joke you have translated with your smartphone leaves your audience baffled, you risk nothing more than embarrassment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sacred texts are another matter. Some religions eschew translations: faithful Muslims are meant to read the Koran in Arabic. Jews similarly revere their original texts. Reading them in Hebrew (some passages are in Aramaic, a related Semitic language) is the mark of a scholar."}, {"role": "body", "text": "By contrast, the two faiths\u2019 cousin\u2014Christianity\u2014has a long tradition of translation. The Bible not only includes Jewish texts as the Old Testament, but also a New Testament written in Greek. Nearly every quoted word in the gospels is a translation, as Jesus and his followers spoke Aramaic. For centuries the Western church\u2019s Bible was a translation: St Jerome\u2019s Vulgate, the predominant edition until the Reformation, rendered the original Hebrew and Greek into Latin. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Translation is a vexed undertaking as it has theological consequences. In the Old Testament, Isaiah said an almah would give birth. Today most scholars agree that it probably just meant \u201cyoung girl\u201d. The translation of Isaiah\u2019s Hebrew into pre-Christian Greek (in the Jewish text known as the Septuagint) rendered it as parthenos, or \u201cvirgin\u201d. For Christians, this bolsters the idea that Jesus\u2019s birth fulfilled a prophecy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now most people read the Bible in their own language. A new book, \u201cThe Word\u201d by John Barton, an Anglican priest and former scholar at Oxford University, explores the complexities in converting millennia-old texts into modern English. You might think that an excellent knowledge of the source language, the subject matter and English style would be enough, but those are just bare prerequisites for a translator, and will not spare them endless hard choices. Mr Barton distinguishes between \u201cformal\u201d and \u201cfunctional\u201d equivalence. Should a translator try to carry across the language of the original (its form) or its purpose (function)? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some translators have produced a text of such quality that its readers simply consider it \u201cthe Bible\u201d. Martin Luther set the standard for modern High German with his translation; every subsequent German version has been compared with his text as much as with the originals. The same goes for the King James Bible. Expressions such as \u201clong-suffering\u201d passed into standard English from its pages. Few readers today know that they were once strikingly earthy literal translations from Hebrew. (They were also the work of William Tyndale, on whose translation the later King James scholars drew. Tyndale had courted controversy for translating the Bible and was executed for heresy.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most translations aim for a text that belongs to its distant time and place yet is accessible to 21st-century readers. That demands certain decisions. There is no such single thing as \u201cmodern English\u201d: there are many styles and registers. Some translations, intended to reach young or less literate populations, err on the side of slang and read as uninspired. Even when attempting to be neutral\u2014when telling the story of Noah\u2019s ark, for example\u2014should the translator look to the style of a legend, a novel, an eyewitness account, a history or a news report? Each has its particular vocabulary and turns of phrase. (Mr Barton suggests that the Hebrew style of this story is best considered that of a legend.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then there is the question of the variety within the Bible itself. Some translators strive to create a unified style for the whole book. The word biblia was originally a plural, and with reason: the composition of the Old Testament spanned most of a millennium, a fact reflected in its language. The New Testament books may vary less, but vary they do. How might a translator approach the first two chapters of Luke\u2019s gospel, which are so distinct they are thought by some to belong to a different author?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Vladimir Nabokov said that every translator\u2019s job was to \u201creproduce with absolute exactitude\u201d and that anything else is either \u201can imitation, an adaptation or a parody\u201d. Yet when it comes to the Bible, translators must consider whether they regard the text as a \u201csacred script\u201d or a \u201csacred story\u201d, Mr Barton says. Hew to the script, and you create a difficult text that risks excluding readers from salvation. Rework the language and you risk presuming to improve on the word of God. Even staunch atheists will learn a great deal from Mr Barton about the horns of a dilemma that could belong to the devil himself.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Johnson, our columnist on language:And the word of 2022 is\u2026 (Dec 14th)The translator of the future is a human-machine hybrid (Nov 30th)Why do some words sound similar in completely unrelated languages?
