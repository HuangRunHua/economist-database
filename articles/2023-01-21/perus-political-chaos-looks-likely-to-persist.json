Next year it may have a seventh. The latest resident of the presidential palace, Dina Boluarte, took office last month after Pedro Castillo, her predecessor, bungled a coup attempt. She did so in accordance with the constitution, backed by the institutions of state. She was, after all, Mr Castillo\u2019s vice-president, elected to take his place in such circumstances. But in the eyes of many Peruvians her presidency is illegitimate. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since Ms Boluarte took office, the country has been shaken by protesters demanding her resignation, fresh elections and a new constitution. Indigenous and rural people, among whom Mr Castillo campaigned with promises to upend the status quo, are particularly angry. His 16 months in power were marked by corruption scandals, ineptitude and chaos. But many of those who voted for him blame the elites in Lima, the capital. They were furious when he was ousted so swiftly. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The demonstrations were at first peaceful but quickly turned nasty, then deadly. By January 16th, 50 people had died in the unrest, most of them civilians in clashes with the police and army. Several of the victims were not even taking part in protests, such as Yhamileth Aroquipa, a 17-year-old girl killed by a stray bullet."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Boluarte has described the protesters as a \u201cgroup of radicals making the country bleed\u201d. On January 14th she extended a state of emergency in much of the country. Extremists have no doubt been involved in the riots. Mr Castillo and his leftist allies have fanned the flames by insisting he is the victim of a coup. But Gonzalo Banda, an analyst, says that Ms Boluarte is underestimating the muscle of indigenous and rural groups, especially in the south.

If she did, it would leave the speaker of the chamber, a retired military man, in charge of the country.

This is now supported by 40% of Peruvians, double the number in 2021, according to a recent survey.
