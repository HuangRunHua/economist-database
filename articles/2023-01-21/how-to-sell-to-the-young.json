I don\u2019t need to remind you that \u201cmillennials\u201d and, increasingly, \u201cGen Z\u201d are our most important markets. Together they make up a majority of the world\u2019s population and a third of America\u2019s. The trouble is that coming up with rules to define a swathe of humanity is more art than science. It is liable to become an exercise in applying stereotypes; not every youngster is sipping kombucha in a Brooklyn warehouse. Luckily you have me, and I\u2019m here to tell you that much of what is written about marketing to today\u2019s most prized consumers is a myth."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Start with the idea that, glued to smartphones, Gen Z barely notices the physical world and slavishly follows the latest hype from Instagram or TikTok. It\u2019s true that the days of marketing chiefly through television, newspapers and magazines are long gone. Yet social media has not just changed the ways in which people discover brands; it has undermined the power of marketing as a whole. Such is the ease with which digital natives can fact-check our dodgy marketing claims and swipe left on our ads that it is getting harder to build brand loyalty. Online, talk is cheap and prices are readily Googled. Surveys suggest that young Americans are among the most price-sensitive food shoppers. It doesn\u2019t help that they have accumulated less wealth than earlier generations had by the same age."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is a similar temptation to think that physical shops no longer matter. Young consumers love their Amazon deliveries. It makes sense for our company to make sales via social media and ship directly to customers\u2019 homes. But what works best is the seamless combination of the digital and physical worlds. Remember those online-only influencer-backed beauty brands like Glossier, which took the world by storm during the pandemic? It turns out that they struggle to get repeat business and have had to pair up with physical retailers lumbered with bricks and mortar. Remember that most Americans still buy their cosmetics at Walmart. If we want to succeed, we need to offer the best of both physical and virtual worlds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And don\u2019t assume that all young customers are DiAngelo-reading social justice warriors. Four-fifths of America\u2019s Gen Z consider a brand\u2019s sustainability and social impact before checkout, according to one survey. But considering something is not the same as surrendering to it. Gen Z cares less for consumer boycotts than its virtue-signalling parents. It is chiefly youngsters who buy cheap \u201cfast-fashion\u201d outfits to wear once and then send to landfill. And plenty of chains do well among young people without being woke. Just look at Chick-fil-A, which is America\u2019s most popular restaurant among teenagers, according to another survey, despite its chairman\u2019s past opposition to gay marriage and its donations to socially conservative causes."}, {"role": "body", "imageURL": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/uhnrfzqC3v8", "imageWidth": 640.0, "imageHeight": 360.0, "imageDescription": "", "text": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "What really matters is avoiding hypocrisy. Insincerity is easily exposed online, where everyone loves a takedown. Remember the backlash against Boohoo, a fast-fashion firm, when it appointed Kourtney Kardashian, a jet-setting socialite, as a \u201csustainability ambassador\u201d? Don\u2019t post pictures from your private plane, obviously, but don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re Greta Thunberg, either. Avoid platitudes, commit only to causes you can tangibly support and be frank when you are putting profits first. Nobody is perfect. To pretend otherwise is so 2013. We are people just as our customers are and people contain multitudes. Isn\u2019t the story of your life that yesterday\u2019s hippies are tomorrow\u2019s suits? \u25a0"}], "id": 8}
