It is a brooding, scintillating coming-of-age tale, full of delicate fashionings of the macabre. It suggests that it is better to be strange than to conform. Janet, the heroine, is ungainly and unusual. All the same, her obstinate individuality is thrilling today, when teenagers\u2019 need to fit in seems ever more acute and their foibles are constantly displayed on social media. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Elspeth Barker wrote \u201cO Caledonia\u201d, her only novel, in 1991. Critically lauded, it nevertheless fell out of print after 2001. In 2017 Ali Smith called it \u201cone of the best least-known novels of the 20th century\u201d. In 2021, a year before Barker\u2019s death, it was reissued by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson in Britain. Last year it was released in America and Spain; more editions are coming."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The author was eccentric. She grew up in a Scottish castle before studying modern languages at Oxford\u2014though she failed her final exam, as she slept through it. Aged 22, she fell in love with George Barker, a 50-year-old poet and father to ten children from three relationships. (They had a further five children.) She kept a pot-bellied pig called Portia in the kitchen, wrote for literary reviews and taught Latin at girls\u2019 schools. She encouraged her charges to be maverick young ladies, not simpering little girls."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cO Caledonia\u201d is a lyrical evocation of that sensibility. For Janet, conventional girlhood is a half-existence of dolls, ribbons and submission. If to be feminine is to be pretty and motherly, she is not only unfeminine, but half-feral. A haircut makes her look like a \u201cmenacing Hausfrau\u201d. She reads books as though \u201crending the limbs of some slaughtered beast\u201d. At a loss as to how to handle her priggish younger siblings, she nearly maims one, shoves another out of a moving car and attempts to bury a third. \u201cA nasty rat has buried your baby,\u201d she tells her horrified parents. \u201cShe\u2019s gone now.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Frequently hapless and profoundly misunderstood, Janet suffers from the careless cruelties of adolescence. Girls are cliquey and snide, boys are predatory, adults are rarely better. But Janet stays passionate and maintains a love of language. Beth is \u201ca beautiful name, a velvet name, brownish mauve\u201d. Poisonous hogweed is rechristened \u201cLord of Luna\u201d. A darkening Scottish sky in winter \u201csheds an unearthly glory\u201d. Janet perceives strange beauty in the world around her, even if she is derided for it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her short life is a hymn to originality. How much better, Barker implies, to be clever and odd than gormless or dull. Friends are few, yet beloved: Janet\u2019s jackdaw, her sole mourner, searches for her \u201cunceasingly\u201d after her death. Refusing to adopt a lesser companion in her stead, in despair he flies into the castle walls. Dying, but unconquered. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 82}
