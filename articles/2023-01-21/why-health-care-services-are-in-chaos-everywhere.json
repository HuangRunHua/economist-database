Governments hoped to space out infections, buying time to build capacity. In the end, however, much of this extra capacity went unused. England\u2019s seven \u201cNightingale\u201d hospitals closed having received only a few patients, as did many of America\u2019s field hospitals. A study of Europe\u2019s experience in Health Policy, a journal, found only one example where there were more covid patients than intensive-care beds: in the Italian region of Lombardy on April 3rd 2020. Although there are now stories of overwhelmed Chinese hospitals, as the country confronts a great exit wave, it is too soon to know whether these are isolated examples or represent broader, systematic failure."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Outside China, covid weighs less heavily on people\u2019s minds these days. Yet health-care systems in much of the rich world are closer to collapse than at any point since the disease started to spread. Unlike for unemployment or gdp, there are few comparable, up-to-date figures on health-care performance across countries. So The Economist has trawled statistics produced by countries, regions and even individual hospitals to paint a picture of what is going on.

The National Health Service (nhs), the country\u2019s state-run provider, is in dire straits. Just before the pandemic struck, someone with a medical issue requiring urgent but not immediate attention, a category that includes those suffering strokes and heart attacks, waited on average 20 minutes for an ambulance. Now they wait longer than an hour and a half (see chart).

Much of the increased spending has gone on programmes to combat covid, including testing and tracing, and vaccines. But funding is now rising across systems more broadly. In almost every rich country more people are working in health care than ever before. Total employment in hospitals in 2021 was 9% higher than in the year before the pandemic in the six oecd countries we surveyed. The latest data suggest that in Canada 1.6m people now work in health care, the most ever. In the eu more than 12m people work in \u201chuman-health activities\u201d, a record.

In England elective-care activity (ie, surgery planned in advance) is slightly lower than it was before the pandemic struck. In Western Australia the share of delayed elective surgeries jumped from 11% to 24% in the two years to November. Put simply, hospitals are doing less with more.

In 2020-21 many people delayed seeking treatment for fear of catching covid, or because their local hospital was shut to non-covid conditions.

Many of the people on the list, and on similar ones in other countries, are likely to be sicker, and thus to take up more resources than if they had received care in 2020.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, estimates that the disease is cutting the number of available beds in the nhs by 2-7%. As covid-positive patients draw resources, providers offer everyone worse care.

If you live in a rich country and fall ill, you expect someone to help. And someone is definitely supposed to help when the tax burden is at or close to an all-time high, as it is in many places. In time, the backlog created by the pandemic will disappear. The surge in respiratory viruses in adults and children has probably peaked. Administrators have made progress in tackling enormous waiting lists. But with an ageing population, and covid now an ever-present threat, pre-pandemic health care may come to seem like it was from a lost golden age. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}]}
