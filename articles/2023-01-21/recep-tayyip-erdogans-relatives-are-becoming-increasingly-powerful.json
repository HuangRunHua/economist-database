Mr Albayrak took over the finance ministry in mid-2018 after a few years as energy minister. By the time of his shock resignation two years later, the central bank\u2019s foreign reserves and its credibility were depleted, and the lira had lost nearly half its value. Yet his legacy lives on. Insiders say the finance ministry is still staffed by Mr Albayrak\u2019s allies. Nureddin Nebati, now the finance minister, is a close friend. On his watch, the country has resumed Mr Albayrak\u2019s policy of cutting rates to stoke growth while selling foreign reserves to support the lira. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Albayrak is Mr Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law. His career is emblematic of the Turkish leader\u2019s tendency to dump technocrats and former AK heavyweights in favour of yes-men, opportunists and relatives. The coup attempt in 2016 was a turning-point, after which Mr Erdogan began to prize family and loyalty over expertise, says one former palace official. His coalition with MHP nationalists in parliament and with supporters who favour closer co-operation with Russia and China has sealed the fate of other former allies. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since 2016 Turkey\u2019s leader has parted ways with Ali Babacan and Mehmet Simsek, architects of the boom of the 2000s, with Abdullah Gul, his predecessor as president, and with Ahmet Davutoglu, a former foreign and prime minister. Mr Davutoglu and Mr Babacan have set up two separate opposition parties, Gelecek (Future) and Deva (Democracy and Progress). Mr Davutoglu accuses Mr Albayrak of engineering his ousting. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And he is just one of Mr Erdogan\u2019s relatives. One of his sons, Bilal Erdogan, commands a following among AK officials and the party\u2019s youth wing. Last year, the younger Mr Erdogan popped up at a summit in Tehran, alongside Ebrahim Raisi and Vladimir Putin, the Iranian and Russian presidents, and also accompanied his father on an official visit to Uzbekistan. The biggest star, however, is the president\u2019s other son-in-law, Selcuk Bayraktar, the chief technology officer of Baykar, a defence company, and the face of Turkey\u2019s successful drone programme. Though popular, even among opposition supporters, Mr Bayraktar has so far steered clear of politics. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Albayrak retains influence through his former ministry, some AK MPs and his older brother, Serhat, who runs Turkuvaz, a media group known for hyperventilating pro-government coverage. But his stock has taken a beating. Many Turks blame him for burning through $165bn in foreign reserves and for the state of the economy. The man once touted as Mr Erdogan\u2019s possible successor could yet turn out to be a cause of the Turkish president\u2019s undoing.\u25a0"}], "id": 56}
