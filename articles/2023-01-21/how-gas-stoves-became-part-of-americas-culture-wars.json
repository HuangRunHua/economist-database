On January 9th Richard Trumka junior, a commissioner at the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), a federal agency, told Bloomberg that the organisation was considering a ban on gas hobs, describing them as a \u201chidden hazard\u201d. That sparked outrage among many conservatives, many of whom blamed President Joe Biden. \u201cIf the maniacs in the White House come for my stove, they can pry it from my cold dead hands. COME AND TAKE IT!!\u201d tweeted Ronny Jackson, a Republican congressman from Texas. Andrew Gruel, a television chef, taped himself to a stove in protest. Even some Democrats were riled. Joe Manchin, a senator from West Virginia, called a ban a \u201crecipe for disaster\u201d. Why have gas stoves become part of America\u2019s culture wars\u2014and could they actually be banned?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Around 38% of American households have gas stoves, although that varies among states. Proponents say that they are cheaper and more efficient than electric alternatives\u200b\u200b\u2014and even that food cooked on them tastes better. The gas industry has good PR. \u201cCooking with gas\u201d, an advertising slogan from the 1930s, is baked into the American psyche. The American Gas Association, a trade group, publishes recipes on cookingwithgas.org. In sponsored social-media posts, influencers rave about their gas stoves. But the appliances, which emit nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and other pollutants, also carry environmental and health risks, including asthma. The dangers can be mitigated with good ventilation, yet indoor pollution is not heavily regulated. Burning gas also releases greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane.

For stoves, rebates of up to $840 are available. Since 60% of American electricity is generated by burning gas and coal, the alternative is not always greener. In an effort to reduce the use of fossil fuels some Democratic city councils have passed legislation to limit use of gas. In 2019, when Berkeley became the first American city to prohibit the fuel for heating and cooking in new buildings, California\u2019s restaurant association tried to sue. (A judge dismissed the lawsuit.) This year New York City will ban gas in some new buildings. A similar plan proposed for New York state failed to pass its legislature last year, but Kathy Hochul, New York\u2019s Democratic governor, may try again. Since 2021 more than 20 states, many of which are governed by Republicans and some of which are also producers of gas, have introduced laws to block local bans."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The federal threat to Americans\u2019 cooking habits is not imminent. On January 11th a White House spokesperson said that the Biden administration had no plans for a ban. Nor is the CPSC, which is independent of the administration, \u201ccoming for anyone\u2019s gas stoves\u201d, Mr Trumka tweeted. Any national ban, if it ever happens, will be on new cookers, not on ones already in people\u2019s kitchens. The CPSC\u2019s current priority is to improve standards for new products. That should allow time for the most heated defenders of gas stoves to simmer down. \u25a0"}]}
