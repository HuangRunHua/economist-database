Being prime minister requires you to have \u201ca full tank, plus a bit in reserve for those unexpected challenges\u201d, she declared at a meeting of her Labour Party in the city of Napier. After five years as New Zealand\u2019s leader, the tank had run dry. Ms Ardern announced that she would step down as prime minister no later than February 7th, and perhaps as soon as January 22nd. \u201cI am human. Politicians are human,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it\u2019s time.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Few saw that coming. Since being elected prime minister in 2017, at the age of 37, Ms Ardern has steered her country through a mass killing, a volcanic eruption and the covid-19 pandemic. At a time of rising populism, she gained a reputation for kindness. When a white-supremacist shot dead 51 mosque-goers in Christchurch in 2019 she donned a headscarf, embraced grieving families and coined a national refrain by declaring: \u201cThey are us.\u201d In early 2020 she was quick to close New Zealand\u2019s borders in response to covid. The death toll from the pandemic stayed low. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her prowess also puffed New Zealand\u2019s reputation overseas. At home, Ms Ardern won the last election in 2020 with 49% of the vote\u2014the best result for any party since 1951. However, her pulling power has lately weakened. Successive polls have shown that Labour is trailing National, the main opposition party. One poll conducted in December found that 38% of New Zealanders would vote for the conservatives in the coming election, compared with 33% for Ms Ardern (though she was still their preferred prime minister)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That reflects an increasingly gloomy mood. Inflation in New Zealand is above 7%. Between 2020 and 2021 house prices rocketed by 25%, leaving New Zealand with some of the most expensive homes in the English-speaking world. Many Kiwis grumble that they cannot afford to buy or rent a property.

She came into office with lofty plans to \u201cbuild a fairer, better New Zealand\u201d by slashing child poverty, ending homelessness and erecting 100,000 cheap houses. But that \u201cidealism collided hard with reality\u201d, in the words of David Seymour of the right-wing ACT Party. Labour\u2019s affordable-housing targets were scrapped. A well-intentioned policy to put homeless people into emergency accommodation is blamed for causing crime. Gangs are warring. Kiwis have been getting worried about a spate of ram-raids\u2014an ostentatious kind of theft that involves driving cars through shop windows. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whoever succeeds Ms Ardern will have an awful lot to do ahead of a general election which is due to take place on October 14th. The most obvious replacement, Grant Robertson, the deputy prime minister, has already ruled himself out. The \u201ccontinuity candidate\u201d would therefore be Chris Hipkins, a 44-year-old who oversaw New Zealand\u2019s pandemic response, argues Neale Jones, Ms Ardern\u2019s former chief of staff.

If two-thirds of them agree on a new leader, that person will immediately replace Ms Ardern as prime minister. If they do not, Labour\u2019s members will also get a vote. Do not expect the kind of mania that accompanied Ms Ardern\u2019s rise. She pulled her party out of the doldrums in 2017, and catapulted it to victory amid a bout of \u201cJacinda-mania\u201d. Her successor might be lucky just to limp back into office. \u25a0"}], "id": 17}
