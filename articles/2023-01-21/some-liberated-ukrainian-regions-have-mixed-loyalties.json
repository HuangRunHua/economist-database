Officials think some still send information on Ukrainian deployments to Russian troops, less than 10km (six miles) to the east. Some Ukrainian troops say they were told not to accept food from locals, for fear of poisoning. A broadcasting tower in Belgorod, a city north of the border, pumps Russian propaganda into local homes. The Ukrainians have been unable to block the signal. \u201cA large majority of the people here were pro-Russian\u201d before the war, says Mr Besedin, and not much has changed."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230121_EUM918.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 781.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russian forces entered Kupiansk without resistance days after the invasion began. The former mayor and most of the city council collaborated with the invaders. Over 200 of the 214 city-council employees, along with the mayor, are believed to have escaped to Russia. The Russians launched a new radio station, distributed copies of the Russian constitution and Russian tabloids, and began to publish their own newspaper, Kharkov Z, packed with stories about Russia\u2019s heroic campaign to save Ukraine from \u201cNazis\u201d. To block news from the rest of Ukraine, they cut off mobile, television and internet access. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not everyone bought into the propaganda. The locals your correspondent encountered mostly backed Ukraine; many of those who sided with Russia have fled.

Vitaliy Sayapin, one of the few officials who refused to side with the Russians, spent over 100 days in a cell so crowded the inmates had to sleep standing up.

In between torture sessions, the Russians would stroll the corridor proclaiming that Ukraine\u2019s leadership had fled.

Oleh Synehubov, the head of the military administration in Kharkiv, the regional capital, says foreign donors offered books in Ukrainian for schools and libraries around Kupiansk. \u201cI said it\u2019s a nice idea, but we don\u2019t have schools and libraries left.\u201d \u25a0"}]}
