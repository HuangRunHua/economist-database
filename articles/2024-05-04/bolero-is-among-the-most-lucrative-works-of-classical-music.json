Originally the score to a ballet, it is catchy and keeps running in the listener\u2019s head long after it ends. \u201cBol\u00e9ro\u201d, a new French biopic about Ravel\u2019s struggle to compose the work in 1928, also employs repetition. Anne Fontaine, the director and co-writer, returns to Ravel\u2019s tortured sexuality, fascination with mechanical noise and slow mental deterioration. He died in 1937 of a brain disease; neurologists think it may have been frontotemporal dementia, which is associated with obsessive repetition."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cBol\u00e9ro\u201d is among the most famous tunes in classical music. The royalties it has generated from live performances, recordings and film soundtracks are estimated at more than $100m. The question of who got all that money is complicated. Ravel had no descendants. On his death the copyright passed to Ravel\u2019s brother, who married his caretaker after a car accident. She then left the rights to her first husband, who married his manicurist. Ultimately the copyright wound up belonging to that manicurist\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage, Evelyne Pen de Castel. "}], "id": 71}
