Turnout averages 75%. More than half of the country\u2019s voters are affiliated with a political party, most of which are centre-right and pro-business. Strong economic growth, which averaged 5.9% over the 20 years after the country took ownership of the Panama canal at the turn of the century, led to calm politics. With few ideological snags, politicians could choose the party which suited them best. \u201cPanama\u2019s political parties are like baseball teams,\u201d says R.M. Koster, a journalist and novelist from the United States who has lived in Panama since the 1950s. \u201cThey play the same game and the star players switch between them.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But now Panamanians are fed up. The canal\u2019s water levels are dwindling, threatening flows of trade and government revenue. Billions of dollars must be spent on dams or underground pipes to keep it full.
