An index of American big pharma rose by a third, outperforming the broader stockmarket thanks to robust sales of blockbuster drugs. One made up of smaller biotechnology companies sank by roughly as much, weighed down by rising interest rates and dissipating pandemic-era euphoria for all things medical.

On April 30th Eli Lilly, maker of a popular weight-loss treatment, delivered another dose of strong quarterly results.
