Around 80 countries, home to some 4bn people, are holding elections in 2024. Some chief executives may already have drafted their compliments for Narendra Modi, who is near-certain to keep his job as prime minister of India, where citizens are now casting ballots in a weeks-long poll. After Mexico\u2019s election in June corporate leaders expect to be congratulating Claudia Sheinbaum, the anointed successor of the incumbent, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Western firms working to reduce their reliance on China have turned to India and Mexico. But neither electoral prospect fills them with unadulterated delight. Mr Modi has made his country an easier place to do business, by simplifying its tax system and investing in infrastructure, among other things. But he has also raised tariffs on goods like cars and increased domestic firms\u2019 tax advantage over foreign ones.

Indonesia, another market that has caught the eye of Western bosses, elected a populist of its own, Prabowo Subianto, in February."}], "id": 51}
