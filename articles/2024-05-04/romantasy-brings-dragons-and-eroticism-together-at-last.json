Perhaps it is because orcs are not that erotic. Perhaps it is because too many characters sing songs containing words like \u201cmerry-o\u201d and \u201cdeedle-dum-diddle\u201d. Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d is rarely considered an erotic romp. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fantasy books generally are not.

One exception is \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d, which does contain lashings of sex.
