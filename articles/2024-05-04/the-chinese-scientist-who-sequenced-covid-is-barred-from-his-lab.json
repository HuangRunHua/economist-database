Take Zhang Yongzhen, a Chinese virologist whose team sequenced the genome of the virus that causes covid in early 2020. Days later he granted permission for a British scientist to publish the groundbreaking work. This allowed the world to design covid tests and begin developing vaccines. But to party officials, hell-bent on deflecting blame for their missteps in managing the outbreak, it was a betrayal. Dr Zhang\u2019s lab was investigated for wrongdoing."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today China remains ill-prepared for a covid-like outbreak\u2014and the party continues to torment scientists whose work might expose its shortcomings. In late April Dr Zhang was informed that his lab in Shanghai, which was examining the origins of covid, would be shut down. In a post on Weibo, a Chinese social-media platform, he said he had been barred by guards from entering the facility. So on April 28th he and some colleagues began a sit-in protest at the lab\u2019s doors. \u201cI won\u2019t leave or quit,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am pursuing science and the truth!\u201d Photos circulating online appear to show Dr Zhang sitting defiantly in a wicker chair or sleeping on the ground outside the lab, as guards watch over him in the background (pictured).
