But it is becoming clear that they might have to. The contest between the two powers is going global. This is an age of political turmoil, economic angst and rising barriers to trade. In Beijing and Washington leaders see opportunities to blame rivals in the other capital for making the chaos worse. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For now, this contest often sounds surprisingly high-minded. Because so many countries fear a conflict between China and America, the two giants have cause to play the responsible, constructive great power. China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, duly adopted a gracious tone when he hosted America\u2019s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Beijing on April 26th. Earlier China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, had accused the Biden administration of trying to contain his country with \u201cendless measures to suppress China\u2019s economy, trade, as well as science and technology\u201d. But Mr Xi wished to talk about the \u201cbigger picture\u201d, namely that \u201cthe world today is undergoing transformation not seen in a century\u201d, and that \u201cwe live in an interdependent world and rise and fall together.\u201d He suggested that China and America should help one another and avoid \u201cvicious competition\u201d. Amid the warm words, Mr Xi offered a rebuke, noting that China opposes alliances and American-led \u201csmall blocs\u201d. That is code that China uses when accusing America of endangering peace by maintaining defence alliances with Atlantic partners in NATO, and with its Indo-Pacific partners, Japan, the Philippines and South Korea.
