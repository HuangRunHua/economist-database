The operation included spreading rumours that dengue fever, a mosquito-borne illness, was created by an American NGO, and that Africans who received treatment were being used as test subjects by American military researchers. The campaign, based around a Russian-funded news site, was intended to sow division and harm America\u2019s reputation. Discouraging Africans from seeking health care was collateral damage along the way."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The campaign was brought to light through the work of the Global Engagement Centre, an agency in the US State Department. Once a false story is detected, the agency works with local partners, including academics, journalists and civil-society groups to spread the word about the source\u2014a technique known as \u201cpsychological inoculation\u201d or \u201cpre-bunking\u201d. The idea is that if people are made aware that a particular false narrative is in circulation, they are more likely to view it sceptically if they encounter it in social-media posts, news articles or in person."}], "id": 66}
