Nearly 40% of South Koreans over 65 live below the OECD\u2019s poverty line, set at half the national median income. In Japan that rate is 20%. The OECD average is 14%. South Korea\u2019s and Japan\u2019s abundance of old people and lack of young ones, combined with changing labour markets and inflexible pension systems, mean the problem is likely to worsen. Other rich countries will soon face similar issues. East Asia provides an example of what works\u2014and what doesn\u2019t. "}], "id": 17}
