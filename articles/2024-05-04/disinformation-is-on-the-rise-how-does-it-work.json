News anchors, speaking English and Chinese, made a series of false claims about Ms Tsai, the outgoing president, and her ruling party. On election day itself, January 13th, an audio clip began to circulate in which Terry Gou, a candidate who had dropped out of the race in November, seemed to endorse the candidate of the China-friendly KMT party (in fact, Mr Gou made no endorsement).
