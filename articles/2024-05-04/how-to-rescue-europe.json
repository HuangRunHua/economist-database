The leader who sat down with The Economist on April 29th is an altogether graver figure. He has lost none of his combative energy. But his analysis of the threats encircling Europe is resolutely bleak. At stake is the survival of Europe as a safe place, a guarantor of prosperity and the liberal democratic order. \u201cA civilisation can die,\u201d Mr Macron warns, and the end can be \u201cbrutal\u201d. \u201cThings can happen much more quickly than we think.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Macron is speaking just days after giving a speech at the Sorbonne in which he first said that \u201cour Europe can die\u201d. In our interview, conducted in the first-floor salon dor\u00e9 of the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the French windows thrown open to the broad lawns below, the president stresses far more starkly the urgency and gravity of the moment. His worry concerns not just the European Union, or even the defence of European territory. It is about the durability of a set of rules and values, underpinned by economic wealth and physical security, which bind all Europeans. "}], "id": 37}
