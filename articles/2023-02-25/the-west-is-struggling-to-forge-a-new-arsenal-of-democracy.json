The factory in Scranton makes the steel casing of M795 155mm howitzer shells, of which America has given Ukraine more than 1m over the past year. But even such prodigious quantities of ammunition are not enough: Ukraine is firing roughly as many shells in a month as America can produce in a year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The process of making shells is quite involved. Thick, 20-foot long solid steel cylinders are first cut into stubby billets.

One end is \u201cnosed\u201d into a precise cone shape\u2014a process that Rich Hansen, who supervises the plant for the army, likens to cutting the top off a Coke can and squeezing the remaining part into a narrow point without leaving a single crease.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The fighting in Ukraine has come as an unpleasant reminder that high-intensity warfare, which the West has not really experienced since 1945, swallows up munitions at an extraordinary rate. A similar lesson had to be learned in the first world war, when the French faced shortages of shells after only six weeks and the British and Germans soon after. This munitions crisis led to the fall of the British government in 1915. As Hew Strachan, a historian, has observed, what started as a military problem quickly became an industrial and then a political one.

America has started sending shorter-range 105mm howitzers and shells to make up for the shortfall in larger calibre rounds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ukraine will soon be dependent on what the American and European arms industries can manufacture (plus a few shells scrounged by America from allies in Asia, such as South Korea, which has a sizeable arms industry but strict export rules). Currently, America can make about 180,000 155mm shells a year, while Europe, according to Bastian Giegerich of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank, produced about 300,000 last year.

That means, in effect, that contractors usually have the capacity to make munitions only at the pace needed to replace those expended in training."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Western governments and defence contractors are now scrambling to increase their output. The rush has echoes of the early days of covid-19 when countries found they had hardly any reserve stocks of protective clothing or ventilators. Unfortunately, it takes a bit longer to set up production lines and supply chains for weapons than it does for rubber gloves and face masks. Doug Bush, the US army\u2019s acquisition chief, says the Pentagon has learnt from the experience of the pandemic to issue contracts with unprecedented speed and give industry a clear \u201cdemand signal\u201d. Congress, meanwhile, has authorised greater use of multi-year contracting to give firms more certainty about that demand. However, until now, such contracts have been used mainly for expensive planes, ships or tanks, not the munitions they fire.

It\u2019s not a new thing. Industrial mobilisation in world war two and the Korean war also took time.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A similar process is under way in Europe. Armin Papperger, boss of Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall, says his firm can quickly lift production from 70,000 to 450,000 shells a year or more, having recently agreed to buy Expal Systems, a Spanish ammunition producer. Rheinmetall is also setting up a new munitions plant in Hungary. CSG, a Czech arms manufacturer that produced 100,000 shells last year, is hoping to boost its output to 150,000 this year. A Norwegian firm, Nammo, could also increase production. Former Warsaw Pact countries are even toying with reopening factories to make 152mm munitions, so Ukraine can keep using its Soviet artillery.

Mr Papperger has said he is prepared to \u201cpre-finance\u201d some of the investment required to accelerate production of shells and missiles, but there are limits to what private companies will do without firm orders. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ukraine, meanwhile, needs weapons now, both to fend off a Russian offensive and to launch one of its own. Shells are the most pressing requirement, but the rapid depletion of guided munitions, particularly Javelins and Stingers, may cause even greater problems in future. Even at newly accelerated rates of production, according to Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), an American think-tank, replacing the 8,500 Javelins that Ukraine has received will take nearly seven years. As for Stingers, Ukraine has already received as many (1,600) as all buyers bar America over the past 20 years. The Pentagon will probably order more advanced alternatives instead of Stingers for itself, but to replace those used in Ukraine would take more than six years."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230225_FBP501.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The root of the problem is the fragility of the defence industry. Both in America and in Europe, the state of the supply chain can be surprisingly opaque, even to prime contractors making the weapons and government departments ordering them. The difficulties often lurk in the second and third layer of suppliers. They are often highly specialised but small enterprises. The barriers to entry for new firms are high because of the exacting certification required to provide equipment to the armed forces and other peculiarities of doing business with defence ministries. This means that particular widgets in weapons are often made by only one firm, raising the risk of a breakdown. Bottlenecks include shortages of labour, semiconductors, tools, sub-components and more. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For old technology, such as 155mm shells, the main obstacle to increasing production is brute industrial capacity\u2014notably the machinery required to forge and machine shell casings. There is also a need to boost the supply of explosives: IMX-101, which is made at only one factory in America, and TNT, which is imported."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For guided munitions, meanwhile, the multitude of components makes for many potential constraints. A shortage of just one or two parts can hold up production of an entire type of weapon. If the maker of a simple bracket goes out of business, a new supplier must be certified and its product tested for compatibility. Chips for weapons\u2014often requiring the ability to withstand extremes of heat, humidity and vibration\u2014are a perpetual headache. The problem is not usually the most advanced semiconductors, but older chips that may have gone out of production. \u201cThere is no drop-in replacement,\u201d notes a Pentagon official. Increasing production of the Stingers, for instance, required a redesign of parts of the missile so that it could use newer chips."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Of particular concern among missile-makers is the shortage of rocket motors. Only two firms in America make engines for small missiles. One is a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. The other is Aerojet Rocketdyne, which has been the object of several takeover bids and which Greg Hayes, boss of Raytheon, a big arms manufacturer, describes as a \u201cweak link\u201d in the supply chain. Establishing an alternative supplier could take years, however. Rocket propellant is yet another worry."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon\u2019s under-secretary for acquisition, says America will increasingly have to think of including surge capacity when it buys weapons. \u201cWe have to be comfortable with the fact that what we may be building may not be used.\u201d Industry executives note that, with foresight, it is cheaper to store tools than to build them anew. In the end, though, the capacity to surge will come at a cost; maintaining the ability to build weapons quickly tomorrow means having more expensive ones today."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr LaPlante also wants the industry to adopt more standardised, modular designs to allow a plug-and-play capability akin to consumer electronics. Most precision weapons, he notes, have three main elements: a sensor to detect the target; a command-and-control system, be it an algorithm or a \u201cman in the loop\u201d; and an \u201ceffector\u201d, ie, a warhead or other device to destroy the target. If the interfaces between these can be standardised, the components can be swapped easily as weapons are improved or new ones developed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A third way to enhance greater resilience is for America to work more closely with allies, Mr LaPlante says. They could co-operate in setting common standards, produce weapons in more than one country and develop new ones jointly. Australia, for instance, will work with America and Britain to develop hypersonic missiles, and is thinking about making munitions for the HIMARS launchers it is buying. Industry insiders say Norway\u2019s Nammo could become a third source of rocket motors for America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But standardisation and joint procurement are hard, all the more so when they are attempted across national borders. NATO has been banging the drum for it for as long as anyone can remember. The European Defence Agency was set up in 2004 to boost collaboration among European Union members. But it has no authority, and must rely on persuasion. Only about 18% of EU defence procurement is collaborative.

Sanctions may be impeding them from buying the microprocessors needed for precision munitions (hence reports that allies of Russia, such as Kazakhstan, have been taking huge orders for Western domestic appliances to strip them of their chips and pass them on to Russian arms firms), but few would bet against Russia scraping together enough shells for the next offensive and the one after that.
