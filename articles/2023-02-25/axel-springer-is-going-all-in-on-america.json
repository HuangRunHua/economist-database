Lefties loathe him for leading Axel Springer, a publishing giant, because of the aggressive gutter journalism of Bild, its flagship tabloid that helps set the tone of the political debate. Conservatives take umbrage at his provocative pronouncements. And jealous types of all stripes envy his transformation from music critic to media mogul, who in 2020 received Springer shares worth a cool \u20ac1bn ($1.1bn) from Friede Springer, widow of the firm\u2019s eponymous founder, as a gift. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Across the Atlantic Mr D\u00f6pfner does not provoke similar passions. That is about to change, because his ambition is to turn his company into America\u2019s top digital publisher, from number four today. \u201cAmerica has become the main heart chamber and the growth engine of our publishing business,\u201d says Mr D\u00f6pfner. Springer already owns Politico, an American website for political news junkies, Insider, another news site, and Morning Brew, which offers business news. It is all part of Mr D\u00f6pfner\u2019s plan to return to Springer\u2019s origins as a news publisher, except mostly American, not German\u2014and all digital. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He can think boldly about expansion because Springer had a good 2022. Sales by the group, which owns 150 media brands in more than 40 countries, increased by 13% to \u20ac3.9bn, the second straight year of double-digit growth. Operating profit edged up to \u20ac750m. Digital activities accounted for 85% of revenues and more than 95% of profits. While many American rivals were shedding staff, the group hired 400 journalists in America in 15 months to shore up its newsrooms."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr D\u00f6pfner was an early convert to online business. He sold off some of Springer\u2019s print newspapers and magazines. He used the proceeds for digital acquisitions, such as StepStone, one of Germany\u2019s most-visited sites for jobseekers; Idealo, a price-comparison service; Awin, a marketing platform; and Aviv, a property portal. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The next step is to take StepStone public, maybe this year, followed by Aviv, Idealo and Awin. The money from the sales could then be used to buy out kkr, the American private-equity giant which took Springer private in 2019 and became its biggest shareholder, with a 35.6% stake. This would make Mr D\u00f6pfner, who owns 21.9% and exercises the voting rights of Ms Springer\u2019s remaining 22.5% stake, the firm\u2019s incontrovertible owner. That, in turn, would give him free rein to pursue his digital American dream. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s a big bet,\u201d says Douglas McCabe at Enders Analysis, a research firm. Digital news publishing is not yet a strong and sustainable business. Mr D\u00f6pfner paid more than $1bn for Politico, Springer\u2019s biggest-ever acquisition, and top dollar for Insider, too. Although both made money last year, it may be a while before Springer sees a return on those investments."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As for party-neutrality, Mr D\u00f6pfner\u2019s strategy is a response to the perception, shared by many readers, that American publishers have in recent years nailed their colours to the mast not just in their outlets\u2019 opinion pages, which is nothing new, but in their reporting, too. There certainly is room in America for non-partisan news. However, it is unclear whether Mr D\u00f6pfner can pull it off. His German journalists agree to abide by the five \u201cessentials\u201d of Axel Springer\u2019s constitution, which include support for the transatlantic alliance and the right of Israel to exist. In Germany he is renowned for his anti-woke, sometimes libertarian views, which in American eyes are bound up with the Republican Party. Mr D\u00f6pfner insists he does not interfere in the editorial process and encourages disagreements with his opinions. But his world view prevails both at Bild and Welt, a broadsheet. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Springer\u2019s American rivals will not cede ground to it willingly, either. Their journalists are already making him feel unwelcome. Two months after his Politico acquisition, the New York Times ran a story headlined \u201cAt Axel Springer, Politico\u2019s New Owner, Allegations of Sex, Lies and a Secret Payments\u201d, about trysts with employees of Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild. Mr D\u00f6pfner sacked Mr Reichelt the day after the story was published. But the saga has damaged Mr D\u00f6pfner more than earlier controversies. In spite of evidence of Mr Reichelt\u2019s misdeeds unearthed by a compliance investigation, he hung on to the editor for months, and defended him privately as a courageous journalist who had the guts to rebel against woke conformism. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "After months of fierce criticism about his handling of the affair, last November Mr D\u00f6pfner resigned as head of the German association of publishers. He put this down to the need to focus on his \u201ccontrarian bet\u201d on non-partisan journalism in democracies around the world, America chief among them, at a time of polarisation and populism. Given the scale of the task he has set himself, the media baron certainly needs all the time he can get. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}]}
