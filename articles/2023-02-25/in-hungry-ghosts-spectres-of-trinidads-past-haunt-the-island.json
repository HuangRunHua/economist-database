The upside, from their perspective, is that they can survive on carrion that would poison most other animals. \u201cKnowing to savour bowels and maggoty flesh,\u201d each scavenger that swoops into Kevin Jared Hosein\u2019s novel is \u201chated by the world that it will eventually eat\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ghosts, it turns out, have similar powers. The dead consume the living much as vultures devour corpses. Grief engulfs people, resentments harden and trauma echoes across generations. The ravenous ghosts in Mr Hosein\u2019s novel are spectres of the Indian labourers shipped to Trinidad to toil on sugar plantations after the abolition of slavery in 1833. Along with their offspring they haunt the dilapidated barracks on the island\u2019s defunct estates."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Hosein joins a line of Indian-Trinidadian writers, including V.S. Naipaul and Sam Selvon, who have grappled with the country\u2019s history of indentured labour. He connects this past to Trinidad today. \u201cPassage\u201d, his short story of 2018, told of a Trinidadian family who illegally cremated a dead child in the early 2000s. \u201cHungry Ghosts\u201d darts back to the 1940s to explore the ancient Indian mythology that underpins such rituals. The narrative unfolds in a sugar-cane barrack, beside a river \u201cblack with the ashes of babies\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The ghost of Hema Saroop, an infant cremated by her mother, Shweta, after dying from a waterborne disease, leads a cast of immaterial characters. She is \u201ca preta\u2014a hungry ghost\u201d, her spirit cursed with an insatiable appetite. She eats her mother so ferociously that Shweta never utters her daughter\u2019s name again. But the baby still hungers for company, and brings other ghosts with her."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What follows is a deft merging of the dead and the living. Shweta\u2019s \u201csunken eyes\u201d struggle to fend off a fatal slumber. Her husband, Hansraj, impersonates his wealthy boss after he is murdered. Her son, Krishna, joins a gang of boys who are fascinated with death. Vultures circle overhead. Life is liminal, Shweta thinks, \u201call shall breathe in death and breathe out death onto everybody they meet.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gloomy as all this may sound, the author\u2019s bravura style illuminates the story. A passage describing the landscape around the barrack, a \u201cplace of lesser lives\u201d, is luminously sketched in \u201cshades of green soaked with vermilion and red and purple and ochre\u201d. A dead rabbit seems almost to be reanimated in Mr Hosein\u2019s staccato sentences, its bones snapping like the \u201cstalks of sugar cane\u201d, as if \u201cthe body refused to surrender to death.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The hungry ghosts in this story refuse to succumb to oblivion too. The barracks are ramshackle palimpsests of their histories and hopes. In the Trinidad of the 1940s, it seems, it is the imperialists who are on their way out. By contrast, the shades of the indentured feed and grow, like \u201cbright pink lotuses in night soil\u201d. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
