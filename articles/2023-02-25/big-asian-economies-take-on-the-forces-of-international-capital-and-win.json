Officials in many emerging economies deployed their holdings to defend local currencies.

The combined holdings of large Asian reserve holders\u2014China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan\u2014have risen by $243bn since October, through a combination of revaluation and new purchases, to a total of $5.6trn.

Countries that entered 2021 with larger reserves and greater credibility in their capacity to intervene saw smaller depreciations in their currencies, all else equal. The authors calculate that additional reserves worth ten percentage points of national gdp were associated with 1.5% to 2% less depreciation in the domestic currency, relative to the dollar. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile, a number of countries which began this period with modest reserves have suffered deep depreciations. The Egyptian pound, which traded at 16 to the dollar at the start of 2020, now trades at 31. The official exchange rate of the Pakistani rupee has also weakened, from 154 to the dollar at the start of the covid-19 pandemic to 278 more recently. In both places black markets offer even weaker rates. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Ahmed and co-authors note that healthy foreign-exchange reserves could have another benefit. Removing the need for interest rates to be used to defend the currency enables \u201cdomestic monetary policy to better target domestic objectives\u201d.

Although the imf is not as vehemently opposed to foreign-exchange intervention as it once was, it still draws some limits. As recently as October, around the time when the dollar peaked, Gita Gopinath, the institution\u2019s deputy managing director, and Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, its chief economist, warned developing economies not to use currency intervention in place of tighter monetary and fiscal policy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The experience of large currency-reserve holders during the dollar\u2019s recent surge might give governments other ideas. Being able to resist the pressure to follow the Fed\u2019s interest-rate movements is a goal held by many developing economies\u2014and the more reserves they hold, the more resistant they seem to become. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 61}
