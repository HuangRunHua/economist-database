In Gonzalez v Google the parents of a woman who was killed in a terror attack on Paris in 2015 claim that YouTube aided the terrorists by recommending the group\u2019s videos to users. The case focuses on the legal protection from liability given to internet companies under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. In Twitter v Taamneh the family of a man killed in an attack in Istanbul in 2017 allege that Twitter, Google and Facebook should be held accountable for spreading terrorist propaganda. The court\u2019s decisions are expected in June.

It is not unusual for businessmen to be suddenly detained by the Chinese authorities when an investigation has begun into a company. Officials have so far kept tight-lipped about Mr Bao\u2019s whereabouts. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Bank of Israel lifted its main interest rate by half a percentage point, to 4.25%. It was the eighth consecutive rise, prompting a rebuke from Israel\u2019s foreign minister, who called on the government to put a stop to the increases.
