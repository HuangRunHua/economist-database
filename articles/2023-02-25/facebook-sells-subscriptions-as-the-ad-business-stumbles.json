The world\u2019s largest social network still is. But from this week its users and those of its sister app, Instagram, will have the option of paying $11.99 a month for a \u201cverified\u201d account, buying them better customer service, more widely distributed posts and a blue badge next to their name."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The subscription is the latest example of a growing trend. Last June Snapchat, a messaging app popular among 20-somethings, launched a $3.99 plan called Snapchat+. In December Twitter relaunched Twitter Blue, an $8-per-month service. Like Meta\u2019s offering, both offer an assortment of perks, the most significant being a more prominent place for the user\u2019s posts in the feeds of others."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is hardly surprising that ad-supported networks are looking to diversify their sources of revenue. After years of non-stop growth the online-advertising business has hit a speed bump. The great one-off shift of ad budgets from offline locations, like newspapers, to the web is mostly complete. And since 2021 mobile advertising has been hampered by anti-tracking rules pioneered by Apple, which make it harder for apps like Facebook to target ads and measure their effectiveness."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The results have been painful. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, has reported falling revenue in each of the past three quarters. Despite a recent rally its stock is trading at less than half the value at its peak in 2021. Snap, which owns Snapchat, has lost nearly 90% of its market value in the same period. Twitter, which was bought last October by Elon Musk, a mercurial self-styled \u201ctechnoking\u201d, is \u201ctrending to breakeven\u201d having previously faced bankruptcy, its owner tweeted this month."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscriptions are no substitute for ads. Snap said on February 17th that 2.5m people had signed up to Snapchat+, less than 1% of its app\u2019s 375m daily users. That implies annual subscription sales of no more than $120m, or less than 3% of Snap\u2019s total revenue last year. Though Twitter has not said how many have joined Blue (its entire press office seems to have been sacked), a recent leak put the figure at below 300,000. The product remains a work in progress, with promised features such as fewer ads still billed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d. On February 17th Twitter adopted a new approach to driving sign-ups, announcing that two-factor authentication by text message, a security feature, would shortly be turned off for those who don\u2019t cough up."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meta says its offering is aimed at \u201ccreators\u201d, who use its platforms for work and might be most willing to pay for verification and extra reach. Whereas \u201cElon has a plan for everyone to buy Twitter Blue (but has yet to give good reasons why), for Meta it is about a scalable way to prevent impersonation of businesses [and] celebs,\u201d suggests Benedict Evans, a tech analyst. Rob Leathern, a former Facebook executive, rejects the idea that the plan is a copy of Snap\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s efforts: Facebook has been working on verification for years, he says, citing its acquisition in 2018 of Confirm.io, a biometric-ID startup."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To the extent that social networks embrace subscription it will mean a windfall for the mobile platforms that host their apps. Google, which runs the Android operating system, and Apple, which runs iOS, make no money from apps\u2019 advertising revenue, but take a cut of consumers\u2019 in-app purchases, including recurring subscriptions. Having whacked the mobile ad business with new privacy rules, Apple and Google stand to profit from the resulting move to subscriptions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There may be a sting in the tail. Whereas Meta\u2019s new service costs $11.99 for those signing up on the web, the price if paying via the app is $14.99. Similarly, Mr Musk, who has called Apple\u2019s fees \u201ca 30% tax on the internet\u201d, charges $8 for Twitter Blue online and $11 in the app. Such two-tier pricing has proved controversial, with Apple blocking apps such as Fortnite, a video game which told users they could pay less in a browser. But as more large companies embrace differential pricing, consumers may learn that they can get a big discount by signing up outside Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}]}
