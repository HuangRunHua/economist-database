Ambling across the courtyard of the grandest mosque in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, he stops to greet a group of men who are sitting on benches under a tree. Their response is familiar and warm. He reaches into his bag, brings out a small box and coaxes a black scorpion into the daylight, perching it on his hand. The men are fearful and fascinated, but keep their distance. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "They know the bagman as Usman Maikunama, the self-proclaimed Scorpion King of Gwoza, a town in the far north-east of Nigeria, where the murderous jihadists of Boko Haram once held sway. His surname means scorpion-owner in Hausa, the main language of the Muslim north. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone calls me,\u201d he says. \u201cThat black one has enough poison to kill a man,\u201d he declares, putting a scorpion back in its bag, where it nestles with a host of others. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Evidently he has no fear of the arachnids. He feeds them liver and cow dung \u201cto boost their poison\u201d. He has spent his entire life, gloveless, among scorpions. His father bred them. He has brought up his children among them, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "His grandfather taught him how to handle and care for them, not as pets but as a source of income. \u201cUnder the rocks, in the forest, anywhere I find a scorpion I take it,\u201d he says. His grandfather also taught him how to make herbal remedies from tree bark and roots. He would sell the scorpions\u2014along with their antidote. He would make potions to fend off a variety of afflictions, including the effects of sorcery. Mr Maikunama offers other services, such as smoking out snakes from people\u2019s houses. He has taught the secrets of his trade to his sons."}, {"role": "body", "imageURL": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/O8-uCob-_XE", "imageWidth": "640", "imageHeight": "360", "imageDescription": "", "text": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "His prices vary according to the status and needs of his customers. \u201cI don\u2019t sell them without selling the inoculations,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I give you the medicine, you can even put the scorpion in your mouth and it won\u2019t harm you.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The scorpion man has plied his trade all over the region\u2014in Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, even as far as Ethiopia and Sudan. But these days he stays closer to home, limiting his trips to Abuja, where he has found useful patrons such as the Guards Brigade, the unit responsible for protecting Nigeria\u2019s president and much of the capital. Its insignia is a black scorpion. Some officers, he proudly reveals, now keep the biting creatures as mascots and pets."}]}
