He was also, at the time, an editor of the European Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and frequently also a peer reviewer for papers submitted to other journals. Sure enough, two papers containing apparently fabricated data soon landed on his desk. He rejected them. But, a year later, he came across them again, except with the fishy data changed, published in another journal.

He did so, he said in his confessional memoir, \u201cFaking Science\u201d, because they otherwise failed to provide a solution that was \u201csimple, clear, beautiful and elegant\u201d. Like many similar fabulists, however, he was also driven by career incentives. The aphorism \u201cpublish or perish\u201d reflects an academic truth. A long publication list is crucial for promotion, or for switching institutions to get a better job. But journals prefer studies that show strong, positive results\u2014meaning much of a researcher\u2019s effort is, in terms of career advancement, wasted. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Publishing lots of studies has enabled some fraudsters to be perceived as leading experts in their fields, with the perks of professional prestige which go with that\u2014at least until things unravel.

Unrealistic publication quotas are often needed to obtain the best jobs in hospitals, and those who publish in top journals also get big cash bonuses. Not surprisingly, China is thus a country that has developed a thriving paper-mill industry. Indeed, almost all retractions linked to paper mills list Chinese authors. Of papers submitted to journals, about a fifth have at least one contributor from a Chinese institution, yet this fifth accounts for nearly half of papers subsequently retracted.

In 2009 PLOS ONE published a round-up of 18 surveys of scientists, mostly in America, that had asked about fraud. Though only 2% of respondents admitted falsifying data themselves, 14% said they knew someone who had. Similarly, a third of those asked confessed to other questionable research practices, such as dropping inconvenient data points based on \u201cgut feeling\u201d, or making important changes to a study\u2019s protocol while it was in progress.

This was based in part on seven now discredited studies by Joachim Boldt, a German anaesthesiologist.

By one estimate, this approach may have caused 10,000 deaths a year in Britain alone.

So if you had one paper, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily identify them,\u201d says Alison Avenell of the University of Aberdeen, who is part of a team that has raised concerns about hundreds of clinical trials published by several research groups. Common patterns in dodgy papers, she opines, include unusually big effects of the reported treatments, peculiar drop-out rates among participants, or the same data appearing in different trial reports. \u201cYou see things that are virtually statistically impossible,\u201d she says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dr Carlisle and others have devised various statistical checks to catch unusual numbers in single papers.

When he looked at papers for which the authors had not submitted individual patients\u2019 underlying numbers, he found that 2% included false data.

Yet, though reviewers who vet journal papers for publication \u201cget all of these supplemental files and links to data sets\u201d, says Lisa Bero, of Cochrane, \u201cmost of them don\u2019t look at it.\u201d Moreover, though authors often say that the backup data for their papers will be made available on request, a study conducted in 2022 reported that 93% fail to provide them when so requested by other researchers. \u201cYou ask for the original data and then, my goodness, you realise we live in a dangerous world,\u201d says Ian Roberts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

But that is rare for these types of reviews, partly because retracted papers are often not flagged prominently as such in online libraries and so continue to be cited as if they were valid research. Indifference plays a role too, with many researchers reluctant to set things straight even when told their reviews included fabricated studies. The attitude is, \u201cit was right at the time\u201d, says Jack Wilkinson, a biostatistician at Manchester University. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For example, Dr Avenell and her colleagues assessed the impact of 27 retracted clinical-trial papers, covering several medical conditions. These papers were included in 88 systematic reviews and clinical guidelines. The researchers reckoned that in half of those the conclusions were likely to change if the retracted trials were removed. They notified the authors of all the reviews about the retractions. Only half of them bothered to reply. A year later, in 39 of the 44 reviews that would have been affected, no action was undertaken."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Similarly depressing discoveries have been made in recent years for paper-mill articles. Though lots of these are so sloppy that any serious researcher would consider them a joke, and they are thus often published in obscure periodicals which would print anything for a fee, some look solid enough to be accepted by leading scientific journals. These are now discovering they have published hundreds of them. One analysis of 53,000 papers submitted to journals in a variety of disciplines, spanning six publishers, flagged between 2% and 46% of them as suspicious.

Elisabeth Bik, a Dutch microbiologist turned full-time detective hunting for fabricated papers, has an exceptional talent for doing just that. Using her \u201cpattern-matching eyes and lots of caffeine\u201d, as she put it in a recent opinion piece, she has analysed more than 100,000 papers, and found blot-based evidence of error or cheating in 6,500 of them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Studies with falsified Western blots may seem less consequential than fabricated clinical trials.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dr Bik and others have recently found what they say is evidence of image-manipulation, including of pictures of blots, in these studies. And other scientists have tried and failed to replicate the results of a landmark study Dr Lesn\u00e9 published in Nature in 2006, which appeared to provide crucial evidence concerning a hypothesis that links the disease with so-called amyloid plaques in the brain, and which is one of the most cited papers in Alzheimer\u2019s research. This particular article may have sent an entire line of scientific inquiry into that hypothesis in the wrong direction, by pointing a finger at one particular form of amyloid beta, the plaque-forming protein. In July 2022 Nature published an expression of concern, while it investigates. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Similar patterns are emerging in genetics. In a study published last year Jennifer Byrne, a cancer researcher at the University of Sydney, led a team that screened nearly 12,000 papers using Seek &amp; Blastn, a piece of software they developed themselves, to check details of substances called nucleotide-sequence reagents (NSRs).
