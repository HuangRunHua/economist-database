The kingdom has sought to keep Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s blood-soaked dictator, a pariah. Asked about rumours that his country may change course, though, Prince Faisal bin Farhan hinted that Mr Assad\u2019s isolation was nearing an end. \u201cThere is a consensus growing that the status quo is not workable,\u201d he said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has spent tens of billions of dollars working to overthrow two unfriendly regimes: Mr Assad\u2019s, and that of the Houthis, a Shia rebel group that controls much of Yemen. In the coming months it will probably admit that both efforts have failed. This is not because the Saudis have developed an affinity for their foes. Rather it is another sign of how the kingdom, like some of its Gulf neighbours, increasingly sees the rest of the Arab world as a tiresome nuisance."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Saudis were early supporters of the uprising against Mr Assad. They began sending arms and money to Syrian rebels in 2012. The insurgency, of course, would go on to end in defeat: light arms from the Gulf and the West could not match a larger investment by Iran and, later, Russia. But even after Mr Assad\u2019s Pyrrhic victory, the Saudis (along with Qatar) refused to restore ties with him, or to allow him to resume his place at the Arab League, from which Syria was suspended in 2011."}, {"role": "body", "text": "They are no longer so adamant. Prince Faisal said in Munich what other Gulf diplomats say in private: there is no longer any clear route to remove Mr Assad. \u201cWe all have policies, but we don\u2019t have any strategy to implement that policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no pathway towards achieving the maximalist goals that we all have.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Diplomats think the kingdom could announce a rapprochement with Syria at the next Arab League summit, which is usually held in March (and this year will be hosted by the Saudis).

The country has been in turmoil since the uprising in 2011 against Ali Abdullah Saleh, its longtime dictator. His replacement, Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi, was an empty suit who proved incapable of holding the country together. That left a vacuum, eagerly filled by the Houthis, who had fought an on-and-off insurgency since the 1990s."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In late 2014 they marched on the capital, Sana\u2019a, and then Hodeida, the main port on the Red Sea. By March 2015 they had reached the southern city of Aden. Mr Hadi fled on a boat. That drove the Saudis to intervene at the head of an Arab coalition. Operation Decisive Storm, as it was called, has dragged on for eight indecisive years and plunged Yemen into humanitarian crisis. An estimated 19m Yemenis need food aid to survive; three-quarters of the people live below the poverty line."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It has been costly for the Saudis, too. There are no official figures, but the kingdom has spent tens of billions of dollars on the war. Some put the tab as high as $1bn a week in periods of the heaviest fighting."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Saudis are negotiating a deal that would allow them to withdraw. It would not remove the Houthis from power, nor end Yemen\u2019s messy internal civil war.

They are reluctant to pour more money into Egypt, which is now struggling through its second economic crash since 2016: it seems a bottomless pit of need. They may offer a fillip to Tunisia, which is mired in its own debt crisis\u2014but only because the price tag (perhaps $1bn or so) is, relatively speaking, not that big."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Restoring ties with Mr Assad does not mean the Saudis would pour money into rebuilding his ruined country.
