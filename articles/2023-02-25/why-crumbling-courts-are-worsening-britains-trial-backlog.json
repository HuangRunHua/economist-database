As the set of a period legal drama, Inner London Crown Court looks the part. As a modern workplace, it\u2019s struggling to fit the bill. The staff canteen, shut during the pandemic, has been abandoned. The basement is prone to flooding and the ceiling is prone to leaking. Like much of the court estate in England and Wales, it\u2019s slowly falling apart.

Government figures to September 2022 show that 28% of crown-court cases have been outstanding for over a year, with a growing proportion of cases now waiting longer than two (see chart). Crunching through the backlog depends principally on the availability of barristers and judges: shortages of both are the most pressing constraints on progress. But the state of the courtrooms is not helping.

According to the report, 64% of lawyers surveyed had experienced delays within the past 12 months due to the state of the courts. The issues range from the banal to the farcical. Nick Barraclough, a criminal-defence lawyer, describes how, during a cold snap, his trial had to be postponed because there was no heating. \u201cWhen you think of the expense and the delay\u2026it\u2019s just mad that we\u2019re not sitting in court because they wouldn\u2019t service the boiler,\u201d he says.

Its budget was reduced by 25% in real terms between 2010 and 2019. Cuts have rippled throughout the system. Funding for criminal legal aid has fallen by 59% in real terms since 2010-11. Between 2010 and 2022, 244 courts and tribunals\u2014roughly a third of courts in England and Wales\u2014were closed. The maintenance budget has not been spared.

Lawyers describe how, for crimes with prison sentences of less than a year, the incentives to take plea deals become perverse once pleading guilty could mean giving up less time than proving innocence.
