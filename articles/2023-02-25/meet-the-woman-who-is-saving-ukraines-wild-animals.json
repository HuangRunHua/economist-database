The bloody welts that covered his body when he arrived at Natalia Popova\u2019s shelter in January are gone.

A shed on the outskirts of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, is no place for a white tiger.

Ukrainian soldiers accompany her, often under fire, and help her load the animals into her van. Recently, while she was preparing to anesthetise a bear in Bakhmut, the bombing became so intense they ordered her to pull back. She refused. Moments later, a grenade landed metres away. \u201cWe\u2019ll die together,\u201d she remembers telling the bear. The grenade failed to explode. \u201cSince then,\u201d she laughs, \u201cthe soldiers say I\u2019m crazy.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some of her rescues end up at the Kyiv Zoo, which has its own problems. Blackouts mean some of the animals have to spend much of the day in the dark. One of the elephants has learned to take cover during Russian missile attacks, says Kyrylo Trantin, the director. Other animals continue to panic. The zoo has stocked up on firewood, in case the heating stops working.
