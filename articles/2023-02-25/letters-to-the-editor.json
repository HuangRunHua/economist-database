South Korea\u2019s participation in the Vietnam war began by sending aid. That was followed by dispatching non-combat soldiers, and then the deployment of at least 200,000 fully fighting troops. And unlike Vietnam, South Koreans do not see the incentive in engaging in a war in a distant land. Nor does the Ukraine war create a security anxiety for South Koreans. Ukraine\u2019s political and economic interactions with South Korea are almost non-existent. Trade between both countries is a smidgen of South Korea\u2019s overall international trade.

To understand why, consider that AI depends on network effects. To increase its (artificial) intelligence, an algorithm needs loops of predictions and responses. As you point out, ChatGPT was built on a large but outdated data set. Worse, you can\u2019t ring the alarm bell when it provides hallucinatory answers. To increase its nous, OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, is obliged to seek user responses. Hopefully, Microsoft\u2019s customers will oblige. The broader lesson is that even the best algorithm depreciates quickly without feedback. Google has both users and their data.
