Ukraine, after all, posed no military threat to Russia. And a vast and sparsely populated country, spanning 11 time zones, could scarcely be said to need more territory. Rather, it was the gradual emergence in Ukraine of a vigorous civil society that successfully demanded reform of the state, and the inklings of a similar process in Russia, that Mr Putin found threatening. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Before the tanks rolled into Ukraine, Mr Treisman notes, liberal values were spreading fast in Russia. The share of people who told pollsters that freedom of speech was important to them rose from 34% in 2017 to 61% in 2021. Use of the internet was rising rapidly (see chart 2); record numbers were watching Mr Navalny\u2019s YouTube channel. Meanwhile, television viewing, the government\u2019s main tool for shaping Russians\u2019 outlook, was in sharp decline. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The shift is largely generational.

In 2017 some 70% of older Russians told the Levada Centre, a polling group, that they could not survive without the government\u2019s help, whereas only 27% of people under 35 felt the same. And in 2020, despite the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda, some 60% of young Russians told Levada that they had a positive view of America.

This week Mr Navalny echoed that sentiment in a statement conveyed from his prison cell by his lawyers. Alexander Gabuev, who worked for a think-tank in Moscow forced to close last year, laments, \u201cThis is a war against Russia\u2019s future\u2026And Russia\u2019s future will now be very different, regardless of the outcome of the war, from the one it might have been had February 24th not happened.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For one thing, the 500,000 people who have fled are among Russia\u2019s best educated and most dynamic.

Political debate, to the extent there is any in Russia now, occurs not between those who oppose the war and those who support it, but between \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cturbo-patriots\u201d, who criticise Russian commanders for not being brutal and aggressive enough. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "By amplifying pro-war voices and silencing common sense, Mr Putin has achieved an illusion of total support for the war. People are wary of expressing criticism of it in any form but, even so, some 20% of Russians tell pollsters they are against it. It is safe to assume that disquiet is far more widespread than that. \u201cPutin has managed to persuade the minority that it represents a majority, and the majority that it is a minority,\u201d says Leonid Volkov, Mr Navalny\u2019s chief of staff."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Polling conducted by Mr Navalny\u2019s team, which operates from outside Russia, suggests that even among supporters of the war confidence in Mr Putin\u2019s wisdom is fast evaporating. Since the summer, the share of people who think that the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d is going as planned has declined from 40% to about 15%. This is hardly surprising, given the rising death toll. In October 6% of Russians said they knew someone who had been killed in the war; by January that figure had doubled. Two-thirds of Russians know someone who has been mobilised or is fighting in the war. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a recent interview Oscar Kuchera, an actor and television host, neatly captured the inchoate views about Ukraine that are typical of many Russians.

The idea of annexing Ukrainian territory is especially puzzling to him: \u201cDon\u2019t we have enough problems of our own without having to feed someone else?\u201d he asked.

On the surface, Moscow looks much as it did before the war. Some popular Western brands\u2014McDonald\u2019s, IKEA\u2014have disappeared and some martial symbols have materialised. The economy contracted by a little over 2% last year, with the harm inflicted by sanctions largely offset by the benefit of massive export earnings thanks to high prices for oil and gas (see chart 4). Those were equivalent to about $230bn (10% of GDP), according to Re: Russia, a research network, almost compensating for the $275bn of capital that fled the country. The bonanza has allowed the government to boost its spending by a quarter, injecting an extra 5.5trn roubles ($74bn) into the economy. That will only reinforce the state\u2019s growing hold over the economy (see chart 3)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Monthly output in some import-dependent and consumer-facing industries, such as cars and pharmaceuticals, was 50% lower by the end of 2022 than at the beginning.

The government wants to expand the army from its current 1m soldiers to 1.5m. That is 4% of the male, working-age population, a higher share than in any other country bar North Korea. A third of the national budget goes to men in uniform. Spending on the armed forces this year has been revised up by 40% compared with pre-war plans. Spending on domestic security\u2014the machinery of repression\u2014is up by over 50% (see chart 5). Meanwhile, spending on health care has fallen by 9%.
