Nearby, it explains, lies buried Alamayu\u2014the son of Tewodros II, Abyssinia\u2019s king of kings\u2014who died in 1879. \u201cThis tablet is placed here to his memory by Queen Victoria,\u201d the plaque records, sentimentally concluding: \u201cI was a stranger and ye took me in.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is one way of putting it. The story of how Alamayu came to be buried at Windsor Castle is a wild, sad saga of violence and looting. Today Ethiopia (as Abyssinia became) wants his remains back. Unusual as his case is, it cuts to the heart of the wider, ongoing row over the restitution of colonial-era plunder."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A sometime moderniser and now a hero to many (though not all) Ethiopians, Tewodros became irked with Britain and held several dozen Europeans captive at Maqdala, his highland citadel. In 1868 an Anglo-Indian military force, complete with elephants and artillery, freed the prisoners and killed hundreds of Tewodros\u2019s men. He shot himself as his fortress fell. Crowns, robes and jewellery were pillaged by the British, along with sacred artefacts and manuscripts."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As Andrew Heavens relates in his vivid new book, \u201cThe Prince and the Plunder\u201d, they also grabbed Alamayu, then seven years old. Photos of him taken soon after his father\u2019s demise suggest a heartbreakingly glum child. His mother died on the march from highlands to coast, having supposedly requested that he be cared for in Britain. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Alamayu means \u201cI saw the world\u201d. He did, but it was an unhappy odyssey with no homecoming. Back in Britain, Queen Victoria took a shine to him. He crossed paths with Tennyson and Darwin. After brief stints in India, Singapore and Malaysia, he had testing spells in British boarding schools, then a miserable one at Sandhurst military college\u2014officialdom having decided he should join the British army, which, writes Mr Heavens, had \u201cinvaded his country, killed his father and blown his first home to pieces\u201d. He died of pneumonia at 18 and, at Victoria\u2019s behest, was buried in the catacombs at Windsor."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As for the rest of the Maqdala loot: in 1871 Gladstone, then Britain\u2019s prime minister, decried the pillage in Parliament. A few items have trickled back to Ethiopia, including hair cut from the king\u2019s corpse. But much of the booty remains in British institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) and the British Museum (BM), which in 1868 even sent a collector on the raid. The BM holds\u2014but does not display\u201411 tabots, plaques that are supremely sacred to the Ethiopian Orthodox church, itself a pillar of national identity for many Ethiopians. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "All this is part of \u201cthe history and story of Ethiopia\u201d, comments its embassy in London, which has asked for its treasures, too, to be returned. Both the V&amp;A and BM say that, as it stands, British law prevents them releasing the objects from their collections\u2014as with other contested items such as the Benin bronzes and Parthenon sculptures. As for the tabots, the BM says it aspires to lend them to an Ethiopian Orthodox church in Britain."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The basic problem, thinks Frezer Haile, a former adviser to the Ethiopian government, is that there is no effective international mechanism for resolving claims over colonial-era plunder. The UN\u2019s culture agency, UNESCO, has a sleepy committee on the subject, but redress tends to come through ad hoc concessions by individual countries or museums. The widely agreed principles on dealing with art stolen by the Nazis offer a model, he reckons."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is a sensible if ambitious aim. Yet quite apart from the bureaucracy and the rules, there are other hurdles, emotional and political, in this and similar discussions\u2014hard, unpalatable truths to which poor Alamayu testifies. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The authorities at Windsor say it would be difficult to exhume him without disturbing the resting places of others (some hope Britain\u2019s new king will take a different view). While his remains are there, though, immured in the walls of the royal chapel with English monarchs, Alamayu embodies a key historical fact: responsibility for the sins of empire goes right to the top. Museums like the BM take a lot of flak for retaining looted goods, but the ultimate culprit, in this and other ransackings, was the state."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Alamayu bears another message too. Many objects taken from places such as Maqdala are precious and revered. But the pain and debt of imperial exploits are measured not just in artefacts but in people; not in treasure, but in blood."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:The genius of Johannes Vermeer is on display as never before (Feb 8th)A Broadway musical updates \u201cSome Like It Hot\u201d (Jan 26th)The truth about Stone Mountain\u2019s giant Confederate memorial (Jan 12th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
