This landmark book, published in 1989 and named as a finalist for the Pulitzer prize, provides a sweeping account of the period between 1914 and 1922, ranging from the Mediterranean to Afghanistan. It astutely traces the Allies\u2019 motivations for carving up the Arab world and shows why the West\u2019s imperial vision was doomed to fail."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Enemies and Neighbours: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017.

In its first charter Hamas styled itself as the \u201cIslamic Resistance Movement\u201d and declared Israel illegitimate. In 2006 Hamas became the first Islamist movement to ascend to power in the Middle East by winning an election. The authors interviewed hundreds of people over three decades, including the group\u2019s leaders, fighters, opponents and victims.
