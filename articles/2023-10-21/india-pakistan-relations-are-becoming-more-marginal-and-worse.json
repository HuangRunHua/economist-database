For once they were not exaggerating. Cricket contests between the South Asian giants have been their main interaction off the battlefield for three-quarters of a century. Into them each has poured subcontinental volumes of love and hate, nationalist chest-beating, aching for peace, addiction to the fray\u2014and the wholehearted commitment of two great and fascinatingly contrasting cricket cultures. Even for cricket ignoramuses, India-Pakistan bouts are an essential window onto South Asian politics and culture. What, then, to make of the Ahmedabad match, which was attended by Banyan and ended in an easy Indian victory?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mostly that the rivalry has become extremely lopsided, in cricket as otherwise. India\u2019s win was its eighth on the trot over Pakistan in World Cups. And it was significantly crushing. The contest was held in the recently opened Narendra Modi Cricket Stadium, the cricket world\u2019s biggest, and attended by over 100,000 raucously partisan Indian fans. It was an illustration of the demographic and economic heft powering India\u2019s rise in cricket and beyond. Pakistan\u2019s players, only a couple of whom had visited India before, visibly wilted in the arena. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This denotes a big change. In the decades after British India\u2019s bloody partition, Pakistan outperformed India off and on the field. Its GDP per head was 50% more than India\u2019s in 1970. Its cricketers, led by dashing fast-bowlers such as Imran Khan, beat India\u2019s much more often than they lost to them. But Indians are now much richer than Pakistanis, and their cricketers among the world\u2019s wealthiest and best, while Pakistan\u2019s are struggling. Three decades of jihadist violence have made foreign sports teams afraid to visit Pakistan, giving it near-pariah status. By banning Pakistanis from its lucrative domestic tournaments, India has compounded the problem. The team trounced in Ahmedabad had no star approaching the stature of Mr Khan (a great cricket captain, though an awful prime minister, who is now in prison)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pakistan\u2019s relative decline has changed the bilateral relationship. Contemptuous of its neighbour, and now globally minded, India has downgraded it. The days of expanded transport links and people-to-people exchanges, generally for cricket games, are over. Indian diplomats spend more time on Bangladesh than Pakistan\u2014never mind China and America, the great powers India increasingly counts itself among. \u201cNo one is thinking about Pakistan,\u201d says an official in Delhi. Save in one regard: India\u2019s fear of Pakistani terrorism."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That most divisive facet of the relationship has become more dominant as others, including economic ties and cultural affinity, have fallen away. This helps explain why polls show Indian public sentiment towards Pakistan growing more hostile, even as the country fades from view. India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which has risen by peddling fear of Muslims, has encouraged this. Its supporters are the most hostile of all. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "All these changes were evident at the match in Ahmedabad\u2014the sixth India-Pakistan clash your columnist has witnessed on the subcontinent and by far the most depressing. The first encounters were during an uplifting Indian tour of Pakistan in 2004, part of a promising peace process. India\u2019s cricketers and thousands of Indian fans were embraced by Pakistani crowds as long-lost cousins. By contrast, there were no Pakistani fans in Ahmedabad, because India had refused to give them visas. And the Indian fans Banyan spoke with expressed only disdain for their neighbours. Asked what they knew of Pakistanis, three students from Mumbai said only \u201cterrorism\u201d. \u201cEveryone hates them,\u201d a middle-aged man, listening in from the row in front, volunteered. Meanwhile, the crowd screamed abuse at the visiting players. After one, Mohammad Rizwan, was dismissed, jubilant Indians chanted a Hindu victory cry, \u201cJai Shri Ram\u201d, at him.

The security threat to India from Pakistan, though real, is diminished. The potential benefits of co-operation between the world\u2019s most populous country and, soon enough, its third-most populous are growing as environmental and population pressures bite.
