The question is whether Israel should provide electricity to areas which are clearly controlled by Hamas, and where Hamas will use the electricity in order to attack Israel.\u201d Others, such as Tom Dannenbaum, a law professor at Tufts University in Boston, argue that Mr Gallant\u2019s order plainly violates a prohibition on starving civilians\u2014even if the goal is to squeeze Hamas. That may be one reason why, despite Mr Gallant\u2019s combative rhetoric, Israeli officials are privately working with Egypt to ensure that some supplies can come in from the south."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A second source of legal dispute is the idf\u2019s decision, late in the evening of October 12th, to tell 1.1m civilians living in the northern part of Gaza to move south.

But the legal aspects are more complicated."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lawyers distinguish between temporary evacuation of civilians in warzones, which can be lawful, and permanent displacement, where the intent is to prevent them from returning, which is not. However the International Committee of the Red Cross (icrc), a humanitarian group, says that the evacuation instructions, combined with the siege, \u201care not compatible with international humanitarian law\u201d. It is also not always safe to move while the bombardment continues. Video footage verified by the Washington Post showed a number of people including several children who had been killed, apparently by an Israeli strike while they were fleeing to the south on Friday."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The question of evacuation is tangled up with the specific conditions of Gaza, where Hamas is deeply intermingled with the civilian population. ihl, which governs the conduct of armies once they are waging a war, demands that soldiers distinguish between combatants and military objects on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other. Targeting the latter on purpose is always illegal. But an attack that kills civilians\u2014even lots of them\u2014can be legal if it is necessary for some military purpose and proportional \u201cin relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Israel\u2019s targeting is \u201cbroadly within the mainstream of contemporary state practice\u201d and in line with American doctrine, argued Michael Schmitt of the University of Reading and Lieutenant-Colonel John Merriam, a us Army Judge Advocate, in papers published after they visited the idf\u2019s headquarters and studied its procedures shortly after Operation Protective Edge, Israel\u2019s 50-day war on Hamas in 2014."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the same legal principles, even interpreted in broadly the same way, can result in different and sometimes jarring outcomes because of local circumstances. Hamas\u2019s large rocket force, capable of striking most of Israel, means that the anticipated \u201cmilitary advantage\u201d of attacks is seen to be high, note Mr Schmitt and Lt-Col Merriam. That can justify, in the idf\u2019s view, high levels of collateral damage that would appear excessive to an army whose civilian population did not face a comparable threat\u2014though, conversely, the effectiveness of the country\u2019s Iron Dome missile-defence system can have the opposite legal effect. Similarly, Israel\u2019s conscript-heavy armed forces are casualty averse and sensitive to soldiers being taken prisoner. That can result in a greater reliance on firepower."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hamas\u2019s way of war also plays a role in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s not a regular city,\u201d argues Avichai Mandelblit, who served as Israel\u2019s chief military advocate general (mag) from 2004 to 2011 and attorney-general from 2016 to 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s a military city.

You cannot distinguish them.\u201d Israel\u2019s war aim is to destroy Hamas. \u201cIf you want to do it,\u201d says Mr Mandelblit, \u201cthen you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas.\u201d Evacuation of civilians is thus unavoidable, he says. \u201cThere is no other way\u2014the other way is they\u2019re going to be killed.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The law nonetheless demands discrimination. Each target must be judged individually.
