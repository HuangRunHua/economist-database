Then to put the data to work to see who gets sick, with what, and when, and why\u2014and if intervening early can help. The aim is simple. To save them\u2014and the NHS.

Its successes are harder to see\u2014but are there in those same lists, queues and costs. For all exist, in part, because the NHS is keeping many alive who would, without it, be dead. But not being dead is not the same as being healthily alive: an average Briton may reach only 60 or so in good fettle (see chart.

When in 1943 Winston Churchill promised Britain a health service \u201cfrom the cradle to the grave\u201d no one dreamt that Britons would spend so long with one foot in that grave, or cost so much as they stood there. On the contrary: it was thought that the NHS would get cheaper over time as Britons\u2014laid in their cradles by NHS midwives, fortified by NHS vaccinations\u2014would gaze through their newly issued NHS spectacles to a bright, healthy future. The NHS\u2019s very existence, wrote William Beveridge, its architect, would lead to \u201ca reduction in the number of cases requiring it\u201d. It was, one politician later said, \u201ca miscalculation of sublime dimensions\u201d.

Its prognosis is \u201chopeless, actually\u201d, says Sir John. People tend to use the verb \u201ccollapse\u201d to describe the end of the NHS. It will not. It will do something worse: it will ebb. Those who can afford to leave, will. Those who can\u2019t will stay and queue and suffer. \u201cOur NHS\u201d will, almost imperceptibly, become \u201cTheir NHS\u201d.

The NHS must stop mainly treating people who are manifestly very sick and get them when they still, ostensibly, seem well. Which is why, on a rainy Friday afternoon, Dr Ali, slight, clever, softly spoken, is standing in an unprepossessing Tesco car park in Watford outside a yellow van. On it is the Our Future Health logo\u2014and the NHS one.

The life-expectancy gap between Britain\u2019s richest and poorest local authorities is ten years. Yet the gap in expectancy of life without ill health is 20. And those at the bottom of such ranges tend not to volunteer for medical studies. Dr Ali is obsessed by ensuring that they do. Which is why those yellow vans are drawing up in the car parks of Tesco, Asda, Lidl and Morrisons. \u201cNot Waitrose.\u201d Medical trials don\u2019t need more Waitrose shoppers.

The NHS\u2019s size is its great weakness\u2014it is unwieldy and all but impossible to reform\u2014but also its strength. The RECOVERY trial, which found that a cheap steroid cut covid deaths by a third, yielded a result within 100 days. Sir Martin Landray, a professor of epidemiology at Oxford who ran RECOVERY and now runs Protas, a not-for-profit founded to improve clinical trials tackling common conditions, says that in its breadth (almost 70m people) and length of coverage (from cradle to grave) the NHS is \u201calmost unique\u2026The opportunities are really enormous.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Our Future Health is trying to make the most of them. Each volunteer will generate hundreds of data points for researchers immediately; billions when their genomes are sequenced. That data will be married to their NHS data; AI will be used to crunch the lot.

It remains to be seen whether the NHS\u2014a cantankerous, intransigent 75-year-old patient\u2014will accept its medicine. Dr Ali is optimistic: \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to see how the study could fail.\u201d And in Watford and in Grimsby and in Manchester, volunteers queue, and roll up their sleeves. Some to help the NHS. Some to help themselves. Some to help both. Because we are all in this together.
