In a referendum on October 14th Australian voters rejected their Labor government\u2019s proposal to establish an indigenous advisory body, or \u201cVoice to Parliament\u201d. On the same day New Zealanders elected the most conservative governing coalition since the adoption of proportional representation in 1993. The new prime minister, Chris Luxon, pledges to scrap policies designed to boost Maori influence in politics. Have the two countries moved right on race? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Australians certainly moved against the \u201cVoice\u201d, which was meant to give Aboriginal people more say in policymaking. Polls last year suggested two-thirds would approve the necessary constitutional amendments. Yet over 60% voted \u201cno\u201d, rejecting the proposal in every state. Similarly, in dismissing their Labour government, New Zealanders rejected its schemes to promote the Maori language and hazy plans to \u201cco-govern\u201d with tribes. The country\u2019s right-wing minor parties, ACT New Zealand and New Zealand First, called these \u201cdivisive race-based policies\u201d. Both increased their vote. Results are still coming in, but Mr Luxon\u2019s centre-right National Party may need both minnows for a majority."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Critics on both sides of the Tasman had the same complaint, that \u201cindigenous policies risk dividing the nation along racial lines\u201d, notes Dominic O\u2019Sullivan of Charles Sturt University in New South Wales. These naysayers (some of them indigenous) objected to special rules for any group. The opposition campaigns also saw \u201can awful lot of race-baiting\u201d, notes Mr O\u2019Sullivan. Maori leaders complained in September of \u201cdog whistling and outright public displays of racism from political candidates\u201d. Australians displayed \u201ccontempt for us\u201d, said an Aboriginal academic, Marcia Langton, after the referendum. Decades-long reconciliation efforts are in ruins, she and other activists say."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet many Australians see the verdict differently. It \u201cdoesn\u2019t indicate that Australians are unsympathetic\u201d to Aboriginal people, argues Greg Melleuish of the University of Wollongong, but that \u201cthey did not think this was the way to solve their problems.\u201d Aussies are always reluctant to change their constitution; only eight of 45 referendums on doing so have succeeded. And no-campaigners could cite particular reasons for caution in this case. Important details of the Voice were unclear, they noted, including the issue of how its members would be elected and held accountable. Had the government of Anthony Albanese been more willing to negotiate on such issues, the centre-right parties might have been persuaded to back it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The debate is in a sense starker in New Zealand, because it has made far more progress on relations with indigenous people. It had been almost two decades since race was a big electoral issue there. In contrast to Australia, New Zealand\u2019s 19th-century colonists signed a treaty with Maori leaders, recognising Maori rights. Though they were flouted, this provided a legal basis, way back in 1970, for New Zealand to investigate and provide redress. It has reached settlements with almost 90 Maori tribes, or iwi, offering apologies and compensation of NZ$2.6bn ($1.6bn). The process has had bipartisan support for decades\u2014yet now faces scrutiny. ACT New Zealand\u2019s leader, David Seymour, wants a referendum on the extent of its powers. \u201cNo one should be treated differently based on who their ancestors were,\u201d he says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The final make-up of New Zealand\u2019s coalition will not emerge until November. But Mr Luxon is already expected to axe a new Maori Health Authority, intended to give tribes more power over health policy and close a seven-year life-expectancy gap. He will also scrap unpopular plans to share management of water infrastructure with iwi. Whether he might end some of his predecessor\u2019s more cosmetic measures, such as pushing civil servants to speak Maori, is unclear\u2014but many Labour supporters would not mind if he did. \u201cLabour brought the race issue to the forefront because they moved at a pace that is not in line with the public,\u201d says Sir John Key, a former conservative prime minister. Much the same happened in Australia. \u25a0"}], "id": 22}
