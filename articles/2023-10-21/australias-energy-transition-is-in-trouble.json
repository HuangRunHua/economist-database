For decades the fuel extracted from them has been hauled by train to nearby power stations, keeping lights on across south-eastern Australia. But their turbines are winding down. One ageing coal plant shut in April. Three others in New South Wales are due to close within a decade. The state is jettisoning coal so fast it is attempting an \u201cindustrial revolution in 15 years\u201d, said its energy minister, Penny Sharpe."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Australia, the world\u2019s second biggest coal exporter, is finally trying to clean up its power sector, its biggest source of greenhouse-gas emissions. It still relies on coal for 57% of electricity generation and emits more from burning it, per person, than any other G20 country. But its states and centre-left federal government have set targets to slash emissions to net zero by 2050 or earlier. The Labor prime minister, Anthony Albanese, aims to get 82% of electricity from renewables by 2030. That is ambitious\u2014and the transition is already running into problems."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The most pressing is that Australia has deployed enough cheap renewables to undercut its ageing coal plants, but not to replace them. Clean power generation, mostly from wind and solar, has more than doubled in a decade, to 37% of the total. One in three Aussie households has installed PV panels on its roof\u2014more, per person, than any other nation. By comparison, Australia\u2019s coal plants are old, expensive to maintain and power firms are hastening their closure. Over half the 15 stations on the eastern seaboard are due to shut by 2035."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That could leave a big generation gap. State governments which share responsibility for energy with the commonwealth, are stepping in to prop up ailing coal plants to avert blackouts. On September 5th the Labor government of New South Wales said it would negotiate to keep its biggest coal power station, Eraring, open beyond 2025, which is when its owner, Origin Energy, wants to close it. Victoria, another Labor-held state, is paying two power companies not to close their stations early."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Australia\u2019s bounteous renewables resources should help it adjust. It is as rich in sun and wind as fossil fuels. Yet the task is daunting. The federal government estimates that to meet its targets, Australia must install around 44GW of renewables, plus batteries and reliable sources of power such as hydro. Meanwhile, investment in green energy is flagging. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is partly due to years of stop-start climate policy, which tied up parliament and toppled three Australian prime ministers. Between 2013 and 2022, conservative governments tore up a carbon price scheme created by Labor and resisted emissions cuts. \u201cThe problems we face now are a legacy of that dysfunction,\u201d argues Kane Thornton of the Clean Energy Council, a renewables association. Australia still lacks an overarching policy to support its renewable targets, relying instead on a tangle of state and federal incentives."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Power lines are another problem. The national grid may need 10,000km of new cables to link up solar and wind farms. The federal government has allocated A$20bn ($13bn) in low-cost debt to draw investment. But Australia\u2019s size makes the project hard and NIMBY-ist farmers are fighting it. Some protested in tractors at Victoria\u2019s parliament in August, waving signs saying \u201cdon\u2019t fight the hand that feeds you\u201d. Landowners are a \u201chuman toll\u201d in a \u201creckless race to renewables\u201d, said David Littleproud of the rural National Party. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The hold-ups leave state governments little choice but to prop up coal plants. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone appreciated how difficult this would be,\u201d says Tony Wood of the Grattan Institute, a think-tank. He argues for a policy to boost renewables investments, for example by putting a price on carbon emitted from coal plants, or making retailers buy more clean power. \u201cWe need levels of co-ordination between the states, industry and government that we haven\u2019t seen since wartime\u201d, he says. Indeed it is hard to match Australia\u2019s ambitions on the energy transition with its progress. It will not become a renewables superpower if it cannot keep the lights on. \u25a0"}], "id": 23}
