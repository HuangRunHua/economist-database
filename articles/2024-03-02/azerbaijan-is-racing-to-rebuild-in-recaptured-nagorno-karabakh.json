For three decades, however, he was unable to set foot there. In the early 1990s, Agdam fell victim to the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, a multi-ethnic region claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia. Its Azeri population fled, and the town was looted and landmined. But in November 2020, Azerbaijan won back much of the territory, including Agdam. Now, Mr Hajiyev says, a new era has arrived. \u201cI am more than excited to be moving back,\u201d he says, gazing at the ruins of his former high school."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Agdam is the centrepiece of Azerbaijan\u2019s reconstruction of Nagorno-Karabakh: a huge project to rebuild towns and villages and resettle some 700,000 Azeris who fled the region during a war with Armenia in the early 1990s. An area covering 4,400 square km was largely abandoned and militarised, and by the time Azerbaijan took back control there was barely a house left standing. (In September 2023, 120,000 ethnic Armenians fled a second Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh; their homes are now abandoned as their Azeri neighbours\u2019 once were.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "President Ilham Aliyev has pledged that 140,000 Azeris will return to the region by 2026. He is earmarking $2.4bn for reconstruction in 2024, more than a tenth of the country\u2019s annual budget. Roads and railways as well as housing need rehabilitation, and the spending spree is bringing rewards for Mr Aliyev\u2019s friends. Allies of Azerbaijan, a bewildering spectrum including Hungary, Israel, Japan, Britain and Iran, have expressed interest in bidding. Turkish firms have been prioritised, in return for Ankara\u2019s decisive military support in Karabakh over the past four years; by the end of 2023, Turkish firms had won $3.4bn in contracts.

Huge new buildings\u2014a high school and residential blocks\u2014already loom over the remains of the old city, and a tourist path has been marked out with multilingual signs. Several villages have already been completed, and families who have returned display photos with Mr Aliyev in their pristine new houses.
