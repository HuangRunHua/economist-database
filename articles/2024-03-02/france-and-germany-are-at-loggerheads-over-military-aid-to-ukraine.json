Instead it seems to have resulted in an unseemly spat with Germany and raised awkward questions over the extent of both countries\u2019 military aid. Mr Macron, who has taken an increasingly hawkish tone on the issue, declared that Russia\u2019s \u201cdefeat\u201d\u2014his first unambiguous use of that word\u2014was \u201cindispensable to security and stability in Europe\u201d and promised missiles for \u201cdeep strikes\u201d into Russia. But he also criticised those \u201cwho say give them just sleeping bags and helmets\u201d\u2014a swipe at Germany\u2019s initial policy\u2014and said he did not rule out the deployment of ground troops to Ukraine (for non-combat tasks, officials later clarified)."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240302_EUC617.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 739.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The backlash was immediate. \u201cIt is clear,\u201d tweeted Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, who had attended the summit in person. \u201cThere will be no ground troops from European countries or NATO.\u201d That position was echoed by several other governments. Robert Habeck, Mr Scholz\u2019s deputy, was even sharper. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that France is thinking about how to increase its support for Ukraine,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if I could give it a word of advice\u2014supply more weapons.\u201d Mr Habeck\u2019s rebuke reflects mounting criticism among German and other European officials that France has failed to pull its weight in Ukraine, despite Mr Macron\u2019s grandstanding."}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to widely cited figures collected by the Kiel Institute, a think-tank in Germany, France has committed just \u20ac1.8bn ($1.94bn) in aid to Ukraine, including \u20ac640m of military assistance. The institute puts it in 14th place among allies. On Kiel\u2019s count, its total pledges, military, economic and humanitarian, add up to around 0.1% of GDP, a dismal figure compared with 0.5% for Britain, 0.6% for Germany and a remarkable 3.6% for Estonia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "French officials vehemently dispute these numbers, however. They argue that many French deliveries are secret; that the Kiel tracker looks at pledges rather than actual deliveries; and that France has channelled a lot of its support though the European Peace Facility, an EU fund for Ukraine. Last year Sebastien Lecornu, France\u2019s defence minister, insisted that his country would be in the top five if the latter were included. Mr Macron, eager to dispel the accusation of stinginess, has said that French aid in 2024 will hit \u20ac3bn this year, up from \u20ac1.7bn in 2022 and \u20ac2.1bn in 2023."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even going by those figures, though, France\u2019s pledged military aid, totalling \u20ac6.8bn, is still modest as a proportion of GDP and relative to both Britain (\u20ac9.1bn) and Germany (a whopping \u20ac17.7bn, albeit stretching to 2027). French deliveries have included highly impactful weapons like CAESAR howitzers and SCALP cruise missiles, according to Rym Momtaz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank, but only in limited quantities. \u201cThe amount of kit France has supplied isn\u2019t commensurate with its rank as a military power,\u201d she argues, emphasising its \u201cbelow par\u201d donation of shells. \u201cFrance was late to the party.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Macron\u2019s increasingly robust stand on Russia\u2014which marks a sharp divergence from his views early on in the war, when he called on allies not to \u201chumiliate\u201d Russia and proposed security \u201cguarantees\u201d for the country\u2014have been welcomed in eastern Europe. \u201cMacron is for real,\u201d says one Baltic diplomat. \u201cTimes like these require political leadership, ambition and courage to think out of the box,\u201d wrote Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cThe initiative behind the Paris meeting\u2026is well worth considering.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The view from Berlin is less charitable. For Germany, the key outcome of the Paris summit was that Mr Macron dropped what was seen as France\u2019s egregious veto on the use of EU funds to buy ammunition from outside the bloc. Yet the post-summit friction also had other causes. Mr Macron\u2019s emphasis on building a missile coalition was seen as an effort to cajole Germany into sending its Taurus cruise missile to Ukraine. Taurus would not only supplement a dwindling stock of British and French missiles, which have been used to devastating effect, but is also thought to be particularly well suited to destroying the Kerch Strait bridge from the Russian mainland to Crimea."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Scholz has long resisted these calls, fearful that sending Taurus would lead to escalation with Russia. That is not just because of concerns over the sensitivity of Crimea or the fact that the missile could theoretically strike Russian cities. It also reflects a conviction\u2014hotly contested by his many critics\u2014that Germany would need to send troops to monitor how the missiles were used. That is not so much for technical reasons as political ones."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWhat is being done in the way of\u2026targeting support on the part of the British and the French can\u2019t be done in Germany,\u201d said Mr Scholz on February 26th, referring, obliquely, to the widespread belief that British and French special forces in Ukraine exercise oversight by identifying, vetting and programming targets into Anglo-French missiles. Britain and France can deploy such troops with virtually no political or parliamentary oversight. Germany cannot. Merely hinting at this, however, has been seen by some as an outrageous \u201couting\u201d of what his allies are up to."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Moreover, some Germans worry that if the issue were to become a matter for the constitutional court, it could act to jeopardise support for wider German aid. \u201cGerman soldiers\u201d, insisted Mr Scholz, \u201cmust at no point and in no place be linked to targets [Taurus] reaches.\u201d In theory, Germany could send the missiles to Britain or France, allowing their personnel to monitor the weapons\u2019 use. In practice that would require a level of trust that, on the evidence of this week, is sorely lacking. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
