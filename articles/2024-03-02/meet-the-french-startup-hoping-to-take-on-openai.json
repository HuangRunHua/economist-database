So it can seem in the contest to make large language models (LLMs). These algorithms power ChatGPT-like \u201cgenerative\u201d artificial intelligence. OpenAI, the human-sounding chatbot\u2019s American creator, appears leagues ahead. It has made the world\u2019s most powerful LLM, called GPT-4. The firm is gobbling up talent, data and computing power to build cleverer models. That allows it to attract more users, and with them more capital to pour into even more sophisticated algorithms."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But a French startup called Mistral is trying to throw a spanner in this AI flywheel. On February 26th it released a new LLM. Mistral-Large is smaller than GPT-4, measured by the number of parameters it uses (a common gauge of model power). Even so, it nearly rivals GPT-4 in its ability to reason. Mistral also unveiled a ChatGPT competitor, Le Chat (pronounced le shah, like the French word for cat rather than the English homograph). And it announced a deal with Microsoft, an AI juggernaut which already has a deep partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant will take a small stake in Mistral and make the French firm\u2019s models available via its Azure cloud."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mistral is proof that the industry is becoming more open\u2014and less American. If it can mount a serious challenge to OpenAI, this could show once and for all that in generative AI, size is not everything. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer about being bigger\u2014it\u2019s about being creative and being fast,\u201d says Arthur Mensch, Mistral\u2019s chief executive."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The French firm\u2019s rise has been as brisk as the northwesterly wind after which it is named. It was founded less than a year ago and has just 25 employees. Yet its LLMs are leading the growing pack of open-source models, the statistical innards of which are, in contrast to proprietary black boxes like GPT-4, publicly available and can be modified by anyone. That has allowed Mistral to tap an impressive \u20ac490m ($531m) in funding, valuing the company at more than $2bn. Big investors include leading Silicon Valley venture capitalists such as Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst, as well as tech luminaries like Eric Schmidt, a former boss of Google. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mistral owes its early success to cleverly mixing the key technical ingredients of AI\u2014talent, data and computing power\u2014with politics, which is growing in importance as governments ponder the technology\u2019s potential. When it comes to talent, Mistral is a \u201cmatch made in heaven\u201d between French engineering education and American big-tech firms, says Stanislas Polu, a co-founder of Dust, another Parisian AI firm. Three of Mistral\u2019s six founders, and its technical brains\u2014Mr Mensch, Timoth\u00e9e Lacroix and Guillaume Lample\u2014are products of France\u2019s elite technical schools. Like many top AI scientists they have worked at the research labs of Google and Meta, another American tech titan\u2014though in the trio\u2019s case they were building LLMs at those labs\u2019 offshoots in the French capital rather than in London or Silicon Valley. This places them among the 100 or so people worldwide who really know how to train cutting-edge models. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "They appear particularly adept at marshalling training data\u2014the second ingredient of AI success. Mr Mensch will not say how exactly Mistral curates its training sets; it is the source of his firm\u2019s competitive advantage, he explains. But industry insiders confirm that Mistral is, in the words of one, \u201creally clever\u201d at filtering out information that is repetitive or does not make sense. This has allowed Mistral\u2019s models to be much smaller: their parameters number in the billions, compared with an estimated 1.8trn for GPT-4 (both firms are mum on the precise sizes). This allows customers to run them on their own computers rather than in a vast data centre, which many proprietary models require."}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to Mr Mensch, Mistral\u2019s focus on data curation lets the firm use computing power, AI\u2019s third crucial component, more efficiently than its competitors. Training Mistral\u2019s latest model cost much less than the $100m that OpenAI apparently spent to develop GPT-4. Mistral\u2019s approach also makes it cheaper for customers both to fine-tune its models with their own data and then to run them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In technical terms, startups like Mistral enjoy a \u201csecond-mover advantage\u201d, benefiting from all the work OpenAI and others have done, argues Jeannette zu F\u00fcrstenberg of General Catalyst. Critically, in Mistral\u2019s case these technical chops are complemented by political nous, which is helpful given many governments\u2019 belief that home-grown LLMs confer economic and strategic advantages. Another of Mistral\u2019s co-founders is C\u00e9dric O, a former French digital minister. Mr O retains a direct line to the country\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron. When a draft of the EU\u2019s AI Act last year threatened to force Mistral to divulge its data recipe, Mr O co-ordinated, with Mr Macron\u2019s backing, a Franco-German effort to oppose such provisions. These were duly excised from the bill. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The question now is whether Mistral, which has yet to generate meaningful revenues, can transform this enticing techno-political mix into profits. The firm\u2019s bet is that many businesses, especially in Europe, want more control over LLMs than OpenAI is willing to give them, and do not want to be locked into another American tech platform. Such customers, the thinking goes, would be willing to pay Mistral to maintain and run their models. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One worry potential customers may have is how the world will regulate open-source models. A heated debate about whether they will enable bad actors to build bio- and cyber-weapons has died down. The discussion among policymakers is turning from risks to possible rewards: greater transparency, more innovation and less reliance on a handful of powerful companies that have controlled the technology. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have so far tolerated open-source LLMs. But Mr O may have his hands full if the models keep getting cleverer or are found to be misused, for instance helping to spread disinformation during this year\u2019s welter of elections around the world."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Avoiding a political backlash is, obviously, in Mistral\u2019s interest\u2014but lobbying success has a flipside. Regulatory forbearance may lead to more open-source competition. On February 20th Silo AI, a Finnish firm, unveiled a new LLM that is even more open than Mistral\u2019s, furnishing information about the data on which it is trained and the software that did the job. A new version, due out in a few months, will be as good in most European languages as it is now in Finnish and English."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most important, it is still unclear if size matters for generative AI. A test will come when OpenAI at last releases its next model, GPT-5. If it leaves Mistral-Large in the dust, then Mr Mensch\u2019s talk of creativity and speed may ring hollow. Until then, Mistral\u2019s story will continue to resonate. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 45}
