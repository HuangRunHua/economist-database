Mary Cassatt, Edouard Manet and John Singer Sargent took the Netherlands\u2019 first train line to Haarlem. There, in a small museum attached to the town hall, they could admire and copy the works of that city\u2019s greatest artist, who more than 200 years earlier had achieved a freedom of style they strove to emulate, with bold strokes, rough fields of colour and a vivid sense of movement.

James McNeill Whistler stayed late and persuaded a guard to let him touch one of the most famous works, a portrait of \u201cregentesses\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The artist was Frans Hals, who is the subject of a new exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. (A different version was previously shown at the National Gallery in London.) Hals, who died in 1666, was among the most celebrated portraitists in Holland. He was renowned for his technique, which created shimmering effects at a distance but left his dynamic brush strokes visible from up close\u2014a style resembling that of Rubens (whom he knew) and, later, Rembrandt. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such roughness fell out of favour, but in 1868 Hals\u2019s reputation was resurrected by Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger, an influential French journalist. Around the same time Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger wrote effusively about a then little-known Dutch artist whose work he had seen in The Hague: Johannes Vermeer. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the turn of the 20th century Hals, Rembrandt and Vermeer were considered equals, the \u201cbig three\u201d of the Dutch Golden Age. Yet Hals does not have the same standing today. Most people know Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cThe Night Watch\u201d and Vermeer\u2019s \u201cGirl with a Pearl Earring\u201d; few would recognise \u201cThe Regentesses\u201d. Following big exhibitions of Rembrandt and Vermeer, the Rijksmuseum\u2019s show of Hals\u2019s paintings tries to repair that neglect. Its 50-odd works include rarely seen paintings from private collections and several portraits of couples that normally hang separately.

Another merchant wryly tilts his chair back on two legs. The sumptuously clad nobleman known as the \u201cThe Laughing Cavalier\u201d, whose portrait helped resurrect Hals\u2019s fame when it was bought in 1865 for a then extravagant 51,000 French francs (roughly $230,000 in today\u2019s money), looks down with amused satisfaction."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Why did Hals\u2019s reputation ever wane? One explanation is that in an age of ubiquitous snapshots, people had less appreciation for one of Hals\u2019s great strengths: his ability to convey fleeting expressions, especially smiles. These are tricky to pull off, with wrinkled eyes and curled lips, and most artists of the period avoided them.

In a study of a child playing the flute, the subject gazes out of frame, ignoring the viewer entirely; so does a jester playing the lute (pictured). Hals could create conventional, polished works, too: of sober Mennonites in black cloth, their lace ruffs evoked in meticulous detail. Yet he could also render those frills in what looks like a whirlwind of virtuosic brushstrokes. From a distance his portraits of officers, like Rembrandt\u2019s, are convincing tableaux of strutting musketeers and shimmering fabric.
