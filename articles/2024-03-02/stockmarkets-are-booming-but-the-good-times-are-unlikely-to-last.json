The same day, Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 set its own record. Even before Nvidia\u2019s results had been announced, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 had surpassed its previous best, set in 1989. Little surprise, then, that a widely watched global stockmarket index recently hit an all-time high, too (see chart 1).

Despite middling economic growth and the covid-19 pandemic, stockmarkets have offered annual returns, after inflation, of more than 8% a year since 2010, including dividends (cash payments to shareholders, funded by company profits) and capital gains (when the price of a share increases). These returns have been better than those produced by bonds and housing.

The most closely followed measure of them was devised by Robert Shiller of Yale University. It compares prices with inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous decade\u2014a long enough period to smooth out the economic cycle. The resulting cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE, has never been higher than 44.2, a record reached in 1999, during the dotcom bubble.

And the outlook for the profits themselves is also challenging. To understand why, consider the fundamental sources of their long-term growth. We have employed Mr Smolyansky\u2019s methodology to examine national-accounts data for American corporations. Between 1962 and 1989 net profits increased in real terms by 2% a year. After that, profits accelerated. Between 1989 and 2019 they increased by more than 4% a year. We find similar trends across the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries.

Politicians have reduced the tax burden facing corporations (see chart 4). From 1989 to 2019 the effective corporation-tax rate on American firms dropped by three-fifths. Since companies were giving less money to the state, corporate profits rose, leaving them with more money to pass on to shareholders. Meanwhile, over the same period borrowing became cheaper. From 1989 until 2019 the average interest rate facing American corporations fell by two-thirds.

Extending this analysis to the rich world as a whole, we find similar trends. The surge in net profits is really an artefact of lower taxes and interest bills. Measures of underlying profits have grown less impressively. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now companies face a serious problem. The decades-long slide in interest rates has reversed.

True, Donald Trump may see fit to cut America\u2019s corporation-tax rate if he wins in November. But our analysis of 142 countries finds that in 2022 and 2023 the median statutory corporate-tax rate rose for the first time in decades. For instance, in 2023 Britain increased its main rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25%. Governments have also established a global minimum effective corporate-tax rate of 15% on large multinational enterprises. Once it has bedded in, such companies will probably pay between 6.5% and 8.1% more tax, leaving a smaller pool of net profits.

In a world where interest and tax bills remain constant for the next decade while real earnings grow at 6% a year\u2014an optimistic scenario\u2014America\u2019s CAPE would need to rise to 51 to reproduce the overall returns seen between 2013 and 2023. That would be higher than it has ever gone before. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now make things grimmer and assume that valuations revert towards their mean. The CAPE drifts towards 27, near the average since the end of the dotcom bubble. Assume, too, that interest and tax bills rise. Rather than clocking in at 25% of earnings, they drift up to 35%, or around the level in the first half of the 2010s. In this more realistic world, to generate even half the returns equity investors enjoyed since 2010, real earnings would have to grow at 9% a year. Only twice in the post-war period has America achieved this sort of growth, according to Mr Brooks, and in both cases the economy was rebounding from busts\u2014once from the dotcom bubble and once from the global financial crisis of 2007-09."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many investors hope ai will ride to the rescue.
