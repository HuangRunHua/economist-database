When a missile hit nearby she grabbed her six-year-old son and put him in the bathtub, covering him in blankets for protection. A second explosion peppered her with shards of glass. They survived, but Ms Popova is sending her son out of the city. A renewed wave of attacks since December has shaken the confidence of this north-eastern Ukrainian city and region, leaving its people angry and dejected.

No, he would not!\u201d yelled an angry woman your correspondent spoke to in a market at the time. Ten days later Russian troops entered Kharkiv, only to be beaten back by Ukrainian forces. They then spent six months shelling it from the outskirts.

When Ukraine\u2019s army forced the Russians out in September 2022, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians returned. Now Mr Syniehubov says that there are 2.3m people in Kharkiv province, compared with 2.7m two years ago. Shops and businesses began to reopen last summer, and people in Kharkiv shared the country\u2019s widespread belief that a Ukrainian victory was within reach.

Some who returned have begun to leave again, though so far the numbers are small. \u201cCompared with autumn, business is down by 50%,\u201d says Lilia Muntian, co-owner of Pakufuda, a board game-themed caf\u00e9. She says some people have left because their companies have relocated to safer parts of the country. Anna, a teacher, says her 12-year-old son is panicked by the missiles. She plans to send him to family hundreds of kilometres away on Ukraine\u2019s border with Romania.

The drones hit a nearby fuel depot, unleashing a torrent of flaming petrol that killed seven people in total. Since December 30th some 300 city buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and about 200 people injured. At least 20 have died. \u201cIt is not normal to live like this,\u201d says Mr Syniehubov, an air-raid siren wailing in the background. People have grown used to war, but it is taking its toll. In the Victory metro station, a passageway has been converted into subterranean classrooms.

Some rural parts of the province are barely hanging on. In Mala Komyshuvakha, 140km south-east of Kharkiv, seven villagers stand awaiting visitors from the International Rescue Committee, an aid organisation, to register them for a modest cash grant. Only 15 residents remain of the 80 who lived here before the invasion. Every house was destroyed or damaged during the Russian occupation. Sixteen months later there is still no electricity, gas or mobile signal. The stoical villagers make do with occasional aid and pensions, whatever produce they can grow and the chickens, rabbits, geese and goats they keep. For heating, they salvage logs once used to fortify Russian trenches. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
