He suspected that the version of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict he saw portrayed in the media was not the full story. For two months he travelled through the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, talking to wounded children, bereaved mothers and broken men. A Palestinian man urged him to write \u201csomething about us\u201d. Mr Sacco promised, \u201cI will alert the world to your suffering!

There may be hardship, but good always triumphs over evil. Even \u201cMaus\u201d, Art Spiegelman\u2019s dark, Pulitzer-prizewinning graphic novel about the Holocaust, ends with the liberation of the camp\u2019s survivors. Mr Sacco\u2019s \u201cPalestine\u201d, a graphic novel that examines the lives of Palestinians under occupation, offers no such comforts.

Now, 30 years later, demand is so high that \u201cPalestine\u201d has been out of stock both online and in shops. The publisher, Fantagraphics, says interest surged after October 7th, when Hamas terrorists murdered 1,200 people in Israel. Google searches for the comic book shot up to their highest level since 2004, during the second intifada. As the conflict rages on, the book\u2014a 285-page volume collecting all nine issues\u2014has been rushed back into print in America and 11 other countries.

The form has its roots in coverage of the American civil war, when photography was not advanced enough to capture battles, and newspapers sent illustrators to the scene instead.

A Palestinian boy shot by an Israeli settler bleeds to death in his parents\u2019 arms because a curfew imposed by Israeli soldiers prevents them from taking him to hospital.
