His predecessor, far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro, allowed destructive development of the Amazon rainforest and aligned himself with autocrats. He told Brazilians to \u201cstop being a country of sissies\u201d during the covid-19 pandemic, urged them to take hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, and speculated that vaccines might cause AIDS (they do not).

Analysts initially reckoned GDP might grow by just 0.8% in 2023, the year he took office. Official figures, due to be published as The Economist went to press, are expected to show it grew by 3%. Growth is likely to slacken in 2024 due to a weak harvest, but Elijah Oliveros-Rosen of S&amp;P, a ratings agency, thinks Brazil is relatively well placed for strong performance in this decade (see chart).

Affordable green technology of all kinds is pouring in from China, as is money, which is being invested into everything from telecoms infrastructure to mining and hydroelectricity generation.

Both had recently joined the BRICS, a group of emerging economies, and Lula was promoting Brazil as a leader for the global south.
