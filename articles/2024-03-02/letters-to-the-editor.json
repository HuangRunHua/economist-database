Another consistent failing has been the lack of a coherent mission since the end of the cold war. Many people praised the integrated reviews and associated defence command papers of 2021 and 2023. Yet, reflecting the long-term over-ambition of each of the services, these reviews were conveniently ambiguous about whether Britain\u2019s armed forces should commit to the defence of NATO or to global, Indo-Pacific operations (with little consideration of the actual resourcing available). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Reform of the armed services cannot even start until Britain develops a coherent, sustainable military strategy, which unites the efforts of all of its now very limited forces on a specific mission. It is up to the service chiefs to define that mission and to concentrate every activity and all their resources to its achievement.

Some of this expenditure is directly related to the war in Ukraine but, tested in the crucible of that war, Russia is rearming and restructuring its armed forces. Within three years, Vladimir Putin will have a modernised, and puissant, army at his disposal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To counter this, Britain needs a radical uplift in defence spending. Rishi Sunak\u2019s feeble 2.5% of GDP when \u201cthe fiscal and economic circumstances\u201d allow is clearly inadequate. Many defence economists have suggested that 3% of GDP, sustained over a number of years, is a reasonable starting point. At the least, this would enable Britain to tackle issues quickly, such as poor housing and inadequate pay, that are contributing to poor recruiting and the haemorrhaging of trained personnel. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Any increase must also be focused on current warfighting-capability gaps. Britain may need to upgrade its nuclear deterrent, but that should not come at the expense of spending on weapons that are more probably going to be needed now. It cannot be said loudly enough.

Whether because of regulatory arbitrage, riskier or illiquid investments, and other factors, private-equity-backed insurers are deemed riskier than traditional insurers, as measured by the credit spread of their bonds. Conveniently, many insurers issue Funding Agreement-Backed Notes (FABNs) to the institutional bond market.
