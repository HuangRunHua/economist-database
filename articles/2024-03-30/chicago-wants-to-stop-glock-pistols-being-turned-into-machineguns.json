That gun on the hip of a police officer? It\u2019s probably a pistol made by Glock, an Austrian manufacturer. That weapon in John Wick\u2019s hands during a heart-thumping scene? One of them is definitely a Glock. From law enforcement to Hollywood lawbreakers, Glocks are everywhere in pop culture. They are also the gun of choice for real-life criminals.

Using cheap add-ons, criminals are transforming Glock pistols into machineguns.

The District of Columbia and others have also reported problems with these illegal add-ons. Chicago is the first city to sue over the devices.
