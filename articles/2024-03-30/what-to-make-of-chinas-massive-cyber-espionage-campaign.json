On March 25th and 26th America, Britain and New Zealand did so in a co-ordinated blast against Chinese cyber-espionage. American federal prosecutors accused China\u2019s cyber-spooks of waging a campaign for years against a wide range of targets in the West, including critics of the Chinese Communist Party. Britain\u2019s deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, said China showed \u201congoing patterns of hostile activity targeting our collective democracies\u201d. New Zealand blamed state-linked hackers in China for a cyber-attack on the country\u2019s parliament. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Both America and Britain placed sanctions on an alleged front company for one group of Chinese hackers, which they called APT31. They also imposed sanctions on two of the group\u2019s alleged members, while America laid criminal charges against them and five other men. These actions are unlikely to have much impact on China\u2019s efforts. The letters APT stand for \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d. This is technical jargon for an attack that involves lurking undetected in a target\u2019s network. The words also happen to convey the West\u2019s gloomy view of China\u2019s cyber-onslaught. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Spotting a cyber-intrusion, let alone identifying those responsible, can take time. The incidents revealed by the three Western countries mostly occurred two or three years ago. Mr Dowden told Parliament that \u201cChinese state-affiliated actors\u201d had penetrated the Electoral Commission\u2019s email and file-sharing systems in 2021. The breach was first publicly declared in August 2023, when officials revealed that suspicious activity had not been identified until October 2022\u2014more than a year after the hackers had broken in. The perpetrators would have had access to the addresses of Britain\u2019s voters. Mr Dowden did not specify the group involved in that attack. But he said APT31 was \u201calmost certain\u201d to have been behind \u201creconnaissance activity\u201d aimed at MPs\u2019 email accounts in 2021. Most of those targeted were prominent critics of China. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The indictment filed in a New York court against the alleged seven members of APT31 offered rich detail of this team\u2019s activities. The 27-page document said the group operated under the Hubei provincial branch of China\u2019s Ministry of State Security (MSS), the country\u2019s main civilian spy agency. Its front company, Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science &amp; Technology, was set up around 2010. Since then it has allegedly targeted thousands of politicians in America and elsewhere, as well as academics, journalists and pro-democracy activists. According to the document, it has also taken aim at people and companies in American industries deemed of \u201cnational importance\u201d, including those relating to defence, IT and telecommunications."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The British played down the impact of the Chinese hacking it had detected\u2014no elections had been affected and the targeting of MPs\u2019 emails had been \u201cblocked by Parliament\u2019s cyber-security measures\u201d. New Zealand said another MSS-linked group, known as APT40, had been involved in the cyber-attack on its parliament in 2021, but this had not caused the leak of sensitive information. The American indictment, however, said APT31\u2019s activities had \u201cresulted in the confirmed and potential compromise of work and personal email accounts, cloud-storage accounts and telephone-call records belonging to millions of Americans, including at least some information that could be released in support of malign influence targeting democratic processes and institutions\u201d.

Some of them specialise in spying on different parts of the world, says Nigel Inkster, a former deputy head of Britain\u2019s spy agency, MI6. They have considerable leeway to do as they wish, he says: \u201cI\u2019m not even sure that there is any kind of formal political clearance mechanism.\u201d Much of their work is subcontracted to private firms. Last month a huge online dump of documents from one such company, I-Soon, showed its involvement in large-scale cyber-snooping on behalf of a variety of government agencies.

In January the head of the FBI, Christopher Wray, said that China\u2019s state-sponsored hackers outnumbered his agency\u2019s cyber-personnel by \u201cat least 50 to one\u201d. He added that China\u2019s hackers are laying the groundwork for a possible Chinese strike, \u201cpositioning on American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chinese diplomats have dismissed such accusations.
