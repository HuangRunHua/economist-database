The country\u2019s embrace of the dish is a lesson in how traditions are forged and how a nation\u2019s cuisine evolves. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nikolaos Tselementes is considered the godfather of Greek moussaka. In the 1920s he published the first complete Greek cookbook, \u201cOdigos Mageirikis\u201d (\u201cCooking Guide\u201d), which included six recipes for moussaka. His creations contained none of the pungent flavours hitherto used by Greek cooks, such as bay leaf and cinnamon. These were \u201ccontamination\u201d from nearly four centuries of Ottoman rule, Tselementes wrote. He hated garlic and\u2014unusually for a Greek\u2014olive oil. The chefs of antiquity had not tossed cumin or other \u201ceastern\u201d spices into their pots, he said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "His efforts to bake politics into food were successful. \u201cOdigos Mageirikis\u201d became a staple of wealthy urban kitchens and the word \u201ctselementes\u201d synonymous with a recipe book for a while. By tapping into patriotism and Hellenising the hearth, Tselementes revolutionised Greek cuisine. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not all foreign influences were anathema. Like many culinary contemporaries, Tselementes was besotted with French gastronomy. This may have been what inspired him to coat his moussakas in velvety b\u00e9chamel. His Gallic-Greek creations also featured aubergine, as well as fried courgette and, in winter, artichoke. The French gratin\u2014a vegetable casserole enveloped in white sauce and breadcrumbs\u2014was a more likely source of inspiration than versions of moussakas cooked in the Middle East, says Aglaia Kremezi, a food writer. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As chefs and food historians seek to revive lost recipes and resurrect culinary traditions, moussaka proves that authenticity is an elusive concept in food. Cultures have long borrowed from one another, and gastronomy is all the richer for it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A dish ripe for reinvention is also more likely to endure. Tselementes\u2019s moussaka is still served in tavernas around the world. Nowadays there is no single way to prepare it. A restaurant in eastern Corfu bakes crayfish between layers. In Britain cooks might chuck in roast goose: lo and behold the \u201cgoussaka\u201d. As for the b\u00e9chamel, it is best kept light by whipping tangy yogurt with olive oil. If he knew, Tselementes would be whipped into a frenzy. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from The World in a Dish, our column on food:For a Christmas drink, eggnog does not have a heartwarming history (Dec 15th)Lebkuchen, a Christmas biscuit, is a window on German history (Dec 13th)Dave Portnoy, an internet personality, has become pizza\u2019s kingmaker (Sep 28th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 72}
