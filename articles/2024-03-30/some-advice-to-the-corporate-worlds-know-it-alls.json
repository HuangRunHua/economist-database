Only two years ago you were reaching for the stars. Clients jolted by the covid-19 pandemic sought you out as a supply-chain savant and a doyen of digital businesses. The craze over environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations turbocharged your bottom line. Unfortunately, you went on a hiring binge."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now the good times are over. Growth has slowed as clients have cut back on splashy projects. Workforce optimisation has been widespread\u2014though at least you gave something back by hiring extra security staff to see the ex-partners off the premises!

You might go so far as to say the consultants need some wise counsel. That is where my firm\u2014the premier consultant to the world\u2019s consultancies\u2014comes in. I append a 367-slide presentation that goes into the detail, but my diagnosis is simple: you are all too big. The combined revenue of the eight leading firms in your industry is now double what it was a decade ago. Partly that reflects growing demand. But it is also middle-age spread: you are bloated, my friend.

Bain, BCG and McKinsey, the best-of-breed strategy advisers, increasingly string out a contract for guidance into months or years of work helping clients to implement their brainy ideas\u2014an incentive to make their advice even harder to understand. The \u201cbig four\u201d accounting giants, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC, are taking this a step further by running activities from supply-chain management to cybersecurity on clients\u2019 behalf. They call this \u201cmanaged services\u201d; to me it seems like outsourcing on steroids, and about as good for you.

The first is that clients begin to question the value of all those pimply 20-somethings you are billing them for (be assured, our team is staffed exclusively with jaded 50-somethings).
