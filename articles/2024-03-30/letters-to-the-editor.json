Such framing removes any agency and responsibility from the Western businesses that chose to remain in a country that shows no respect for human or investor rights.

Because of its lawlessness, the Russian government already de facto controls the assets of all remaining businesses. The list of companies expropriated by the Kremlin extends far beyond the cases of Danone and Carlsberg, to include firms such as Uniper and Fortum, as well as attempts to arrest the assets of the Russian subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and others. As of November 2023, the Russian courts imposed 93 seizures on the assets of foreign firms. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Values matter too.

The remaining Western firms are facing the consequences of their short-sightedness and greed. Foreign companies in Russia have always had a choice and they still do now. Instead of trying to remain and navigate Russia\u2019s state-controlled chaos, they should drop their keys and leave, writing off the losses and maybe taking their cases to international arbitration.
