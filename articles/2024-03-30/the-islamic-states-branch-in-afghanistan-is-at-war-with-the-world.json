Yet even the Taliban are not radical enough for the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), an offshoot in Afghanistan of the group that established a \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Iraq and Syria in 2014. ISKP propagandists rubbish the Taliban as sell-outs to the West because, among other sins, they meet non-Islamic diplomats and allow unbelievers to supply aid."}, {"role": "body", "text": "During its nine-year existence, ISKP has mainly killed Afghans. The group\u2019s global ambitions burst into view on March 22nd, when at least four gunmen killed 139 people at a concert in Moscow. American officials blamed ISKP for the attack; Russia later arrested suspects from Tajikistan. If the charges are proved they will underscore the group\u2019s expanding record of strikes beyond Afghanistan. It cultivates a long list of enemies, including America and China. In January its recruits hit a church in Turkey and carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in Iran in decades. Two of the suspects spent time in Turkey before travelling to Russia. The Turkish government says that it has made a wave of arrests."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia is in ISKP\u2019s crosshairs because it maintains an embassy in Kabul and has accepted a Taliban military attach\u00e9 in Moscow. It also provides aid to Syria, where Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime helped dismantle ISKP\u2019s parent organisation. The attack in Moscow may also reflect ISKP\u2019s recruiting among Tajiks, Uzbeks and Kazakhs. The group\u2019s in-house media arm, al-Azaim, distributes content in Central Asian languages. Until his arrest last year, Abu Miskin, a Tajik militant, was among its \u201cmost active propagandists and high-ranking recruiters\u201d, according to the UN."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Estimates of the ISKP\u2019s strength vary from fewer than 2,000 to 5,000. Taliban offensives have taken back territory the group once held in Afghanistan. According to Riccardo Valle, director of research at Khorasan Diary, an Islamabad-based group, ISKP\u2019s strength these days is \u201cits ability to find and connect with small numbers of disaffected people\u201d. The current leader is believed to be Shahab al-Muhajir, a 29-year-old of Arab descent. He is rarely heard from, but he can be certain that his disparate organisation will now be at the centre of global attention. \u25a0"}], "id": 14}
