Ms Donaldson, a British author who wrote songs for children\u2019s television, had been inspired by a Chinese fable about a girl who escapes death by convincing a tiger that she is the queen of the forest. But there was a problem: Ms Donaldson wanted the book to be in rhyming couplets, and not a lot rhymes with tiger. She decided it would be more pragmatic for the beast\u2019s name to end with the sound \u201coh\u201d. And so, with the help of Axel Scheffler, a German illustrator, one of the most lucrative monsters in children\u2019s publishing was born."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe Gruffalo\u201d, which was published 25 years ago in March, has achieved such great success that tired parents everywhere have considered jacking in their boring jobs to write children\u2019s books. To date it has sold 11.6m copies worldwide, according to the publisher. Last year Ms Donaldson\u2019s whole oeuvre\u2014now 200 books and counting\u2014brought in \u00a315.6m ($19.6m) in sales, with \u201cThe Gruffalo\u201d leading the pack."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whereas some books cause grown-ups to groan inwardly when a child selects them at bedtime, \u201cThe Gruffalo\u201d is almost as fun to read aloud as it is to listen to. Like most fables featuring animals, it has an unspecific setting and universal themes\u2014the triumph of the underdog, brains over brawn\u2014that help it resonate with both young and old audiences. Credit is also owed to Mr Scheffler, an illustrator with the most recognisable style since Quentin Blake (who collaborated with Roald Dahl). Mr Scheffler has said initial sketches \u201cwere deemed to be \u2018too scary for tiny children\u2019 by the editor so I had to make him a bit rounder and more \u2018cuddly\u2019.\u201d The result resembles one of the terrible creatures from Maurice Sendak\u2019s \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are\u201d (1963), another classic.

Many fans think that the book\u2019s sequel, \u201cThe Gruffalo\u2019s Child\u201d, is\u2014like \u201cThe Godfather Part II\u201d and \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d\u2014even better than the original.

Only \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, first published in 1943, has racked up more foreign editions, says Michele Young, rights director at Macmillan Children\u2019s Books, the publisher of \u201cThe Gruffalo\u201d in Britain. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Because its fame now seems like a foregone conclusion, it is easy to forget that the book defied early expectations. Before Ms Donaldson \u201cpaved the way\u201d for other authors, editors were nervous about books that rhymed, according to Ms Young. It was hard to sell the rights to international publishers, because poetry is notoriously difficult to translate."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Vladimir Nabokov thought translating rhyme was so challenging that writers should not bother. In the introduction to his translation of \u201cEugene Onegin\u201d, which rendered Alexander Pushkin\u2019s Russian verse into English prose, the novelist spelt out his belief that translators should be as faithful to the original text as possible. \u201cTo reproduce the rhymes and yet translate the entire poem literally is mathematically impossible,\u201d he wrote. Happily for children and parents who do not speak English, most translators of \u201cThe Gruffalo\u201d ignored Nabokov\u2019s pleas. Instead they have chosen to channel poets such as Alexander Pope, whose translation of Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad\u201d captures the spirit of the original rather than striving for verisimilitude.
