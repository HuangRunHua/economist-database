Gangs control large parts of the capital, Port-au-Prince. The government of Kenya, which has proposed leading a UN-approved mission to secure Haiti, has said it will not send any forces until a transitional government is in place to take over from Ariel Henry, the exiled prime minister. More than two weeks after Mr Henry said he would step down, a newly formed transitional council has not been able to agree on who would lead it in order to form that government. Two of its members have already dropped out.

In the meantime it is left to Haiti\u2019s ragtag police force to prevent gangs taking complete control of the country. That is not going well. The main port is all but closed, as is the capital\u2019s airport. Aid agencies say that no food has arrived for two weeks. Fuel is running low.
