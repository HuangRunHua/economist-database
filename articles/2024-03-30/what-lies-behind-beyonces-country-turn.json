In 2021 she launched a clothing collection inspired by the \u201coverlooked history of the American black cowboy\u201d. She sat astride a crystal horse for the album cover of \u201cRenaissance\u201d (2022) and wore a white, wide-brimmed hat to the Grammy awards. Her lyrics have frequently referred to her upbringing in Houston. \u201cEarned all this money,\u201d she sang on \u201cFormation\u201d in 2016, \u201cbut they never take the country out\u201d of her."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her new album, \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d, released on March 29th, evokes a honky-tonk. The record is the second instalment in a three-part project conceived during the covid-19 pandemic, in which Beyonc\u00e9 pays tribute to the black roots of musical genres. (On \u201cRenaissance\u201d she focused on disco and house music.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The album is as perfectly timed as a line dance: Americana is flourishing in popular culture. Models have been strutting down Louis Vuitton\u2019s catwalk wearing snakeskin cowboy boots, and Prada is selling bolo ties. Western sagas such as \u201cYellowstone\u201d have drawn millions of viewers. Last year country-music tracks accounted for more than a third of streams of the top 50 songs on Spotify in America, up from 2% in 2016."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s experimentation with country is part of a tradition of artists crossing into new genres in search of new audiences. Bob Dylan forsook acoustic folk for electrified rock (and was called a \u201cJudas\u201d for his efforts). David Bowie tried on a wardrobe of looks and produced different sounds to match. Dolly Parton, Taylor Swift and Shania Twain all left country behind for mainstream pop. Coldplay have moved away from the sometimes dour indie rock of their early albums for more upbeat pop and electronic tunes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those who adapt to new musical trends thrive. Coldplay and Ms Swift are in the midst of lucrative concert tours\u2014which have brought in an estimated $810m and $1bn, respectively\u2014while many of their contemporaries have faded into obscurity. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Beyonc\u00e9 has also evolved to meet changing tastes. In the 1990s, as the lead singer of Destiny\u2019s Child, a girl band, she sang rousing anthems of female empowerment. After striking out on her own, she added soulful ballads to her repertoire to show off her powerful voice and later incorporated reggae and trap. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Country allows Beyonc\u00e9 to experiment with a new style of songwriting again. On early R&amp;B hits she bragged of having too much money to spend. By contrast, on \u201c16 Carriages\u201d, one of the new country tracks, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s lyrics are more down-to-earth: she remembers the toil of her early career and being \u201coverworked and overwhelmed\u201d. Tonally, these songs are better suited to an era of inflation and cost-of-living crises."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As well as being an astute commercial choice, crossing over allows artists to make a statement about their own value. Lady Gaga, for instance, was a pop hitmaker and chose to release an album of jazz standards to prove her vocal chops. Having range has long been important. In the early 20th century, when record labels made and marketed music along racial lines, experimentation became a way for black artists such as Louis Armstrong to \u201cassert that no one should reduce them to a stereotype\u201d, says Eric Weisbard, a music historian. By turning her talents to a host of genres, Beyonc\u00e9 is showing that she has \u201cno limit artistically\u201d, he adds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d has been at the top of the charts in America and Britain. But some have questioned whether Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s tracks are authentic country music. One country radio station even refused to play it. This is a fraught subject in a heavily white genre, which originated 100 years ago and has roots in African-American folk music. Beyonc\u00e9 hopes her work will help to nullify \u201cthe mention of an artist\u2019s race, as it relates to releasing genres of music\u201d. Posting an image of her on yet another horse, she declared: \u201cThis ain\u2019t a country album. This is a Beyonc\u00e9 album.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 70}
