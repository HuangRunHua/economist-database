One is fiscal stimulus during covid-19, which was 40% larger in the Anglosphere than elsewhere. The boost to demand is still visible in \u201ccore\u201d inflation data, which strips out items such as energy, and indicates underlying inflationary pressure. British core inflation is close to 5%.

The public believes prices will rise by 5.3% over the next 12 months, more than in any other country in our ranking.
