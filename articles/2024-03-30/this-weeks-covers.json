Artificial intelligence is generating excitement and hyperbole everywhere, but in health care it has the potential to be transformational. As the TQ describes, it promises better diagnoses, personalised support for patients, faster drug discovery and greater efficiency. In Europe analysts predict that it could save hundreds of thousands of lives each year. There is already evidence that AI systems can enhance diagnostic accuracy and disease tracking, improve the prediction of patients\u2019 outcomes and suggest better treatments. It can also boost efficiency in hospitals and surgeries by taking on tasks such as medical transcription and monitoring patients, and by streamlining administration. Unfortunately, integration has been slow and the results have often been mediocre. Our editorial focused on why that is and what to do about it.Our covers played on a stock medical phrase, \u201cthe doctor will see you now\u201d. Putting \u201csoon\u201d as the last word was ambiguous\u2014it\u2019s later than now, but not very far off. To be clearer, we settled on \u201ceventually\u201d. Health care desperately needs the AI treatment, but its introduction will not be painless. As the doctor says: \u201cThis is going to hurt.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240330_DE_US.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1709.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Leader: The AI doctor will see you\u2026eventuallyTechnology Quarterly: A new prescription"}, {"role": "body", "text": "On our cover in Europe this week we looked at three severe shocks, actual and potential, to the continent\u2019s economy. Partly because of the jump in energy prices that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union\u2019s GDP has grown by only 4% this decade, compared with 8% in America. As if that were not bad enough, Europe faces a surge of cheap imports from China. And within a year Donald Trump could be back in the White House, slapping huge tariffs on Europe\u2019s exports. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Our first idea was to illustrate the impending blight with a flower with rotting blue petals and a euro coin. Europe\u2019s misfortune is particularly ill-timed. American support for Ukraine has dried up and the energy transition has much further to run. A fast-ageing population, overbearing regulators and inadequate market integration continue to hold back growth. Disillusioned European voters are increasingly liable to support hard-right parties such as the Alternative for Germany."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the image implies that we are writing about the 20 countries in the single currency. In reality, the shocks threaten the entire continent\u2014including Britain."}, {"role": "body", "text": "How about our second idea, a crumpled euro note? Somehow, the image is not limited to the currency union. Instead it hints at a fourth danger that we wanted to be a central part of our leader. Although the shocks facing Europe are outside its control, errors from Europe\u2019s own policymakers could greatly aggravate the damage."}, {"role": "body", "text": "We also thought about a classical allusion\u2014a sculpture of a man with a red arrow wrapped around it, pointing downwards\u2014because those errors stem partly from Europe\u2019s understandable but backward-looking urge to preserve industries and jobs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One error would be to fight the previous war against inflation by keeping economic policy too tight at a moment of vulnerability. It will be easier to cope with disruption from outside if central banks keep the economy out of a slump that would stop displaced workers finding new jobs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another error would be to copy America\u2019s and China\u2019s protectionism by giving vast subsidies to favoured industries. China\u2019s recent economic woes demonstrate the flaws, not the virtues, of excessive government planning."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unfortunately, it looked as if the sculpture was grappling with red tape. Classical imagery was good, but we wanted something more precise."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When we saw the image of Mona Lisa, we knew we had what we were after. She has not only received a nasty shock; she\u2019s also gone punk. And that nods towards Europe\u2019s need to junk the past and forge its own, up-to-the-moment economic policy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even as America showers industry with public money, Europe should instead spend on infrastructure, education, and research and development. Rather than emulate China\u2019s interventionism, Europe should note the benefit Chinese firms derive from a vast domestic market. Integrating Europe\u2019s market for services, where trade remains difficult, would help firms grow, reward innovation and replace some lost manufacturing jobs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The hair-raising cover was almost ready, but some of us wanted to tie in the triple shock with our modern Mona Lisa.
