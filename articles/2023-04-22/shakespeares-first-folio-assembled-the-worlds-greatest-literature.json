However, English-language publishers still advertise future titles at the Frankfurt Book Fair\u2014just as they did in 1622. In that year, a catalogue of forthcoming English works featured an intriguing volume, announced between blurbs for a biblical commentary and a genealogical tome.

William Shakespeare, all in one volume, printed by Isaack Jaggard, in fol[io].\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Frankfurt punters had to wait. That bumper book of playscripts by an author who had died in April 1616 proved a tricky, arduous job. The printers completed it in 1623. By 1624, the chunky compilation was pitched at the fair as \u201cMaster Shakespeare\u2019s Works\u201d. According to Chris Laoutaris, a historian of the volume, this upgrade in terminology implied the \u201cintellectual gravitas\u201d of an author with \u201cgrand achievement\u201d to his name. Among dramatists, only Ben Jonson, Shakespeare\u2019s friend and rival, had presumed to publish a swanky folio of \u201cWorks\u201d before. In 1612 the founder of Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library had even warned against collecting play-texts: worthless \u201cbaggage books\u201d.

This large-format volume, around 950 pages long, not only gathered 36 out of Shakespeare\u2019s 38 surviving plays, it was also the cornerstone of his subsequent renown, which 400 years later extends to parts of the world he never knew existed. Fifty small \u201cquarto\u201d editions of individual Shakespeare plays appeared between 1594 and 1623, and \u201cHenry IV\u201d and \u201cRichard III\u201d proved particularly popular.

The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, has 82 copies, gems of the literary treasure trove amassed by Henry Folger, the president of Standard Oil, and his wife, Emily.
