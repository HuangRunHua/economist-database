For the past few weeks, Bolivians have desperately been trying to buy dollars. In February the central bank stopped publishing data on its foreign-currency reserves. In March it took the unusual step of selling greenbacks directly to the public after exchange houses started to run out. When the queue got too long the bank made Bolivians book appointments online. The next available one is in July. Investors are spooked. Government bonds maturing in 2028 have lost a third of their value since January.

When the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates last year it became harder for Bolivia to take on foreign debt. Then came the war in Ukraine, and the annual cost of importing fuel doubled to more than $4bn (or 10% of GDP). The government began dipping into its reserves to prop up the currency, which has been pegged at 6.96 bolivianos to the US dollar since 2011, and to subsidise fuel. Yet although the country\u2019s dollar shortage was exacerbated by short-term problems, it has been long in the making.

Evo Morales, the leftist president elected in 2005, struck it lucky. Soon after he came to power, multilateral institutions wrote off debt for many of the world\u2019s poorest countries. Gas prices doubled to record highs in 2006. This allowed Bolivia to accumulate the largest foreign reserves in its history: they rose from 12% of GDP in 2003 to 52% by 2012 (see chart 1). Real GDP per person has grown by half since 2005. According to the World Bank the proportion of people living on the equivalent of less than $2.15 a day (after adjusting for inflation) fell from 15% in 2005 to 2% by 2019. Annual inflation was 1.7% last year, the lowest in the region. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pundits praised Bolivia\u2019s economic miracle. But it was not sustainable. The government spent much of the windfall from natural gas on fuel subsidies, inefficient state firms and propping up the exchange rate. Fuel prices have been frozen since 2005 at $0.54 a litre, compared with a world average today of $1.31. In 2006 Mr Morales nationalised the country\u2019s vast gas fields. Private companies were forced to sign new contracts with the state firm, Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), and hand over majority control. They also pay royalties amounting to 50% of gross production. The state takes a bigger share of revenue from oil and gas companies than in any other country in Latin America after Mexico, says Marcelo de Assis of Wood Mackenzie, a research firm.

In 1999, after the country\u2019s energy sector was privatised, annual net inflows of foreign direct investment as a share of GDP hit a peak of 12%. Over the past five years it has averaged 0.1%. In 2014 the price of gas fell, and so did production. Annual investment in gas fields declined from over $1bn in 2015 to $300m last year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government refused to adjust its policies when gas prices fell. Instead, it piled on debts and used its reserves to fund its expensive subsidies. Public debt has doubled since 2014 to a whopping 80% of GDP, above the regional and world average, and dangerously high for a lower middle-income country. A study by Fundaci\u00f3n Milenio, a think-tank, found that the profits from YPFB hid combined losses from Bolivia\u2019s 62 other state-owned enterprises that regularly exceeded 4% of GDP."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bolivia has run persistent and large fiscal deficits for a decade. The deficit is 7% of GDP. The IMF expects growth to slow to 1.8% this year. In 2021 Bolivia had a current account surplus of 2% of GDP. But the IMF expects this to turn into a 2.5% deficit this year. It is unlikely that Bolivia\u2019s reserves can make up the funding shortfall. These have fallen from $12bn in 2012 to less than $3.5bn. Only $370m of that is cash, too little to cover even three months of imports. Most of the rest is gold, which one faction of politicians in the government are unwilling to sell. The situation has probably deteriorated even further since the bank last released weekly data in February.

Six months ago he used to buy $3,000 a day and sell half of that. \u201cToday we can\u2019t even get $500.\u201d Bolivians are taking out their savings, swapping them for dollars, and stashing them at home. In the week leading up to March 12th the central bank sold $24m to the public. Another money-changer says that when the dollars ran out customers started buying euros, Brazilian reais, Peruvian soles, or Chilean pesos. Now he is running out of those, too.

On April 11th Luis Arce, the president and formerly Mr Morales\u2019s finance minister, gave a rare interview in which he said there was no need to devalue the boliviano or to remove subsidies.

In January a consortium of Chinese companies announced a $1bn deal to produce the stuff by 2025. Still, Beatriz Muriel of INESAD, a think-tank in La Paz, doubts lithium can replace gas as a source of revenue.

Over two-thirds of Bolivians work in the informal sector, one of the highest shares in the world. Sales from contraband are estimated to be worth the equivalent of almost a tenth of GDP. Since fuel in Bolivia is so cheap, much of it gets smuggled abroad and sold at higher prices. Ms Muriel estimates that as much as half of the $3bn Bolivia exported in gold last year was smuggled in from other countries, and exported from Bolivia, where export taxes are lower. This means that there are dollars in the economy, just not in government coffers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cA balance of payments crisis is coming, like in 1982,\u201d says Mr Machicado. That year Bolivia entered into a crisis that ended in hyperinflation. Today the signs of financial pressure are everywhere. On the streets of La Paz opportunists are selling dollars at much higher than the official rate. Unions will negotiate wage increases in May, and are demanding a 10% rise. Mr Espinoza reckons inflation will rise to 6% by the end of the year. That is low by regional standards, but high for the country. That could lead to unrest. In Santa Cruz, in the east, protests have erupted against the government since it came to power.
