But for Merck, a drugs giant known as msd outside America, the money it is spending to buy Prometheus Biosciences, a biotech firm based in California, is relatively small change. In the world of big pharma such deals have the potential to generate enormous returns. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even though Prometheus makes no profits to speak of and has no approved drugs on its slate, the big prize for Merck is pra023, a drug approaching the late-stage of clinical trials developed by Prometheus to treat ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease and other nasty autoimmune conditions. For now, Prometheus is burning through cash at a fast-rising rate. Merck\u2019s decision to scoop it up is a bet on what comes next."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The American giant badly needs promising new treatments to replenish its drugs pipeline. Like other pharma companies, it is facing a cliff-edge as patents on money-spinning treatments come to an end. Keytruda, Merck\u2019s cancer-immunotherapy drug, accounted for over a third of its sales in 2022, but will face competition from cheaper copycats once key patents expire in 2028 in America and in Europe two years later. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The problem goes industry-wide. Patents for more than 190 drugs will expire before the end of the decade, leaving sales worth as much as $236bn at risk of a dramatic drop-off. Few will be spared the coming onslaught. The world\u2019s ten biggest drugmakers, including Merck and Pfizer, an American rival, stand to lose around 46% of their revenues, which amounted to over $500bn combined in 2021, according to zs, a consultancy. For five of these companies, at least half of their annual revenues are at stake. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pharma bosses are spending big to plug the gaps. The industry has long turned to dealmaking as a way of compensating for the potential loss of revenue from expiring patents. Despite a dearth of mergers and acquisitions in other sectors, drugmakers are driving a wave of consolidation across the sector. pwc, a consultancy, estimates that the value of takeovers in the pharma and life-sciences industries could reach $275bn in 2023, up by almost three-quarters from last year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So far, the prices buyers are willing to pay have come with huge premiums. Merck is forking out $200 per share for Prometheus, a whopping 75% above the firm\u2019s closing price just before the offer was made. Another acquisition unveiled in March will see Pfizer pay $43bn for Seagen, a loss-making cancer biotech firm. The industry\u2019s richest deal in three years came at a 33% premium to Seagen\u2019s share price. And on April 18th gsk, another pharma giant, agreed to buy Bellus Health, a Canadian biotech firm with a promising treatment for chronic coughs, at around double the company\u2019s pre-deal value. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The benefits of paying out vast sums for drugs that are close to regulatory approval are clear. It can take more than a decade to bring a new drug to market, and many cures fail along the way. With a healthy $1.4trn in cash piles waiting to be deployed, big pharma is choosing to buy its way out of trouble instead.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}]}
