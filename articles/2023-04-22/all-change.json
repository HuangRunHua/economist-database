The Benz Patent Motorwagen, which hit German roads in 1886, needed \u201cstain remover\u201d from a pharmacy for fuel, mechanical parts greased by hand, and oil and water tanks filled. Then you had to spin a large flywheel to start the engine, grasp the tiller that controlled the front wheel, and push forward the lever to engage a drive belt that set the vehicle in motion. Repeat the process every 10-15km when fuel and water ran out. Yet the freedom to travel by powering a carriage with an internal-combustion engine (ICE) soon caught on."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A giant industry with annual revenues of nearly $3trn has grown to provide transport to the masses. Over 1bn cars heave passengers along the world\u2019s roads. There were many pioneers beside the Germans. The French provided words like coup\u00e9, chauffeur and cabriolet. America developed mass-manufacturing with the Ford Model T in 1908 and then slick marketing in the 1950s. Japan invented ultra-reliability and just-in-time production. Europe set the mark for luxury, sophisticated engineering and new technologies such as antilock brakes and airbags."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The next phase of the industry\u2019s history will be one in which tech-centric firms and the Chinese come to the fore. Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla has kickstarted electric vehicles (EVs) everywhere. China may be a newcomer but it is growing fast. Until the 1980s the country knocked out only a handful of cars such as the Hongqi limousine that whisked Mao Zedong between military parades and tractor factories. But a 40-year rise to economic superpowerdom has created a car industry to match. China overtook America as the world\u2019s biggest market in 2009. Last year it passed Germany as the world\u2019s second-largest exporter. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The emergence of Tesla and the Chinese as serious competitors reflects unprecedented upheaval in the industry. The obvious shift is electrification. Although a few carmakers are still trying hydrogen fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries have become the key technology. In 2022 around one new car in ten sold worldwide was a battery-powered electric vehicle (EV). Adding plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), which combine a smaller battery with an ICE, and 13% of total sales, or around 10.5m vehicles, were electrified."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China accounts for 6.1m sales of what it calls new-energy vehicles (EVs and PHEVs). But Tesla is the world\u2019s biggest EV-maker, selling 1.3m cars in 2022. China\u2019s BYD is second for battery-only cars and is way ahead when counting new-energy vehicles. Of the old guard Volkswagen Group (VW) is the boldest electrifier. Yet it is only in third place, with 570,000 EV sales, 7% of its total."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230422_SRC437.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 898.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Electrification is changing carmaking. The old brands have relied on the complexity and cost of ICEs to keep competitors at bay. Having to spend $1bn to develop an ICE and another $1bn for the presses, paint shop and production lines to scale up a new firm to 150,000-200,000 units a year creates huge barriers to entry. It is little wonder that, from the second world war until Tesla\u2019s arrival, new brands that made the transition to global significance were few and far between. Those that did, such as Toyota and Nissan in Japan and Hyundai-Kia in South Korea, leant on government support and protected home markets."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The relative simplicity of batteries and electric motors knocks down many of these barriers to entry. A host of startups in China (including Li Auto, Nio and Xpeng) and America (such as Fisker, Lordstown, Lucid and Rivian) are now following Tesla\u2019s lead. Electrification has given a leg-up to China\u2019s established carmakers, which were long kept from global markets by the big obstacle of ICE tech. China has cajoled state-owned and private companies to build a domestic EV industry partly so as to sidestep petrol power."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Congestion ahead"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The arrival of a clutch of new competitors will make a highly competitive industry even more so, not least because car sales may have already passed their peak. China\u2019s eager buyers gave the market its biggest turbo-boost in decades. But the brakes are now on. Car sales fell over the three years starting in 2018, as a saturated market, a worsening economy and the impact of covid-19 all took their toll. Global car production also peaked, at around 73m passenger cars in 2017. Slowing Chinese demand has been compounded by a shortage of the chips that are liberally sprinkled around all modern vehicles. By 2022 global production of cars had fallen to around 62m."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230422_SRC462.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 670.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Forecasts vary widely, but future growth of car sales is likely to be sluggish at best. Pedro Pacheco of Gartner, a consultancy, reckons that sales will eventually return to 2019 levels but they will never go much higher. In a range of scenarios McKinsey, another consultancy, puts the annual number anywhere between 70m and 95m by 2035, but at the upper end most of the growth will be in emerging markets in Africa, India, Latin America and South-East Asia, where the bulk of demand will be for cheap cars. Europe and America have almost certainly peaked already and China is likely to do so soon. Even optimists see growth in China at barely 2.3% a year over the decade after 2019, compared with nearly 7% during the previous ten years.

In the past car brands were defined by the adeptness of the mechanical engineering that went into their handling, their horsepower, the status of their bonnet badges and the satisfying \u201cclunk\u201d of closing the doors of a pricier car.

Chinese carmakers, startups and the tech companies they have joined up with are delivering experiences that far exceed what is available elsewhere.

Though the road to fully autonomous cars is littered with obstacles, a more limited \u201chands-off\u201d autonomy that takes over driving duties initially on motorways and eventually in some urban settings is close to commercial deployment. Carmakers are rethinking their involvement in ride-hailing and car sharing, with the big question over mobility becoming how best to monetise the use rather than the mere ownership of cars, triggering a rethink of car retailing."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A final test comes from new geopolitical tensions, notably between America and China.
