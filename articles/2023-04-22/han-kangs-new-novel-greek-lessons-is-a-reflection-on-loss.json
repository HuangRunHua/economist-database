The surreal and sinister novel chronicled the cruelty inflicted on a woman after she stops eating meat; an overseas audience proved hungry for the story of female oppression and resistance, as well as a narrative style that broke free of realist literary norms. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the next of Ms Han\u2019s novels to be translated, \u201cHuman Acts\u201d, cruelty is inflicted by the state, not family and friends. It was inspired by a massacre of student protesters in 1980 in the author\u2019s home city of Gwangju. Then came \u201cThe White Book\u201d, an autobiographical account of a Korean novelist in Warsaw. As she reflects on the city\u2019s wartime destruction and rebirth, she also muses on the death of her infant sister."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Loss is a theme of \u201cGreek Lessons\u201d, too, Ms Han\u2019s latest novel to arrive in English. Elliptical and fragmentary, it toggles between two unnamed characters living in Seoul. One half of the novel is narrated by a teacher of ancient Greek. The other half follows one of his students, a divorced young poet who, rendered mute by the death of her mother, hopes to regain her voice by taking his class."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Han\u2019s style creates mystery, yet snippets of back story gradually make things clearer. The woman\u2019s loss of speech is a recurrence of a problem that first transpired when she was a teenager. (The remedy then was to learn French.) Adding to her grief is the loss of her nine-year-old son in a custody battle. Her teacher, unsure how to help her communicate, has problems of his own: he is losing his sight."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the heart of the novel lies the difficulty of giving voice to psychological and emotional dislocation; Ms Han uses the characters\u2019 problems as a metaphor for the inadequacy of language in general. But in the closing pages, a story of the mind becomes a story of the body, when an accident leaves the teacher in urgent need of help. A breakthrough in communication suddenly becomes vital. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe shards of memories shift and form patterns. Without particular context, without overall perspective or meaning. They scatter; suddenly, decisively, they come together,\u201d writes Ms Han, during a passage in which the woman recalls a conversation with her son. It is an apt description of how this slender, enigmatic novel works. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 73}
