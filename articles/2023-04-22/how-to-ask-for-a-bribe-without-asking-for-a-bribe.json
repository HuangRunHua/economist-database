Similar messages can be found in public places in many other African countries. In some, such as South Africa and Kenya, citizens are encouraged to call hotlines to report kickbacks. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In most African countries citizens tell pollsters that graft is getting worse. High-profile scandals among bigwigs are one reason for that, though it may also be that dodgy deals are being uncovered more often, rather than becoming more common. For most people, though, it is because they still face regular shakedowns from officials and the police. Fully one in four Africans who used public services or interacted with police told pollsters they had paid a bribe in the previous year, according to a report in 2019 by Transparency International, a Berlin-based NGO. Still, widespread anti-corruption efforts do at least pose awkward questions to the determinedly unscrupulous. For example, how do you best ask for a bribe when you are sitting under an anti-corruption poster?

Some officials, for example, like to keep citizens well abreast of their food and drink preferences. \u201cI really want to drink a Nescafe,\u201d declares an airport security guard six times as he frisks your correspondent in Burkina Faso.
