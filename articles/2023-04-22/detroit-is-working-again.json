Let it be said that Detroit has not turned the corner on all its obvious problems, including a high crime rate and beleaguered schools. But determination has clearly gained the upper hand. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis (whose biggest shareholder, Exor, also part-owns The Economist\u2019s parent company) are making big bets on Detroit, as are Amazon, Google and the developer Stephen Ross. Under Mayor Mike Duggan, in his tenth year, the government has courted investment by offering itself not just as provider of tax incentives and expediter of permits but as real-estate agent and hr department.

Then the city screened candidates, testing them in maths and reasoning, as well as for drugs, offering tutoring to those who needed it. Of 30,000 Detroiters referred by the city, Stellantis has hired some 8,600, at the plant and elsewhere. \u201cIt didn\u2019t do me any good to land a plant in Detroit and hire a bunch of suburbanites,\u201d says Mr Duggan, a practical, old-school liberal in the mould of Joe Biden, to whom he is close. \u201cMy job was to get Detroiters to work.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "By the beginning of the year, Detroit\u2019s unemployment rate had dropped below 7% for the first time since 2000. Mr Duggan boasts that \u201cat this point, anybody in this city who wants to work has a job available.\u201d With tax receipts running well ahead of forecasts, the city is applying its federal covid-relief money\u2014more than $800m\u2014to improving its public spaces and its workforce. It is offering full-time jobs, with benefits, at tasks like cutting grass, but letting workers spend two out of five paid days in apprentice programmes for higher-skilled work."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No American city is more haunted than Detroit by America\u2019s successes and failures\u2014by American capitalism\u2019s power to create and destroy, and by American democracy\u2019s capacity to promise opportunity to all yet deny it by race. The city\u2019s conflicting legacies burden it but also sustain it, giving it a grip on Americans\u2019 imagination no other city can match. \u201cI think across the country folks believe the people of Detroit didn\u2019t deserve what happened,\u201d Mr Duggan says. \u201cThere\u2019s been no shortage of people willing to help.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Henry Ford invented mass production in Detroit, and while working on a Ford assembly line Berry Gordy, playing the piano in his mind, began to create the Motown sound.
