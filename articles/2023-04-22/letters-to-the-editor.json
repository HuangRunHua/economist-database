In their quest to be physics-like and evidence based, economists are prone to a form of selection bias by focusing on problems where data are relatively abundant. In doing so, they tend not to study problems where data are necessarily scarce.

Studying small samples means obtaining qualitative information and inferring logically causal processes about management decision-making, organisational governance, culture and politics within and across firms as they strive to innovate and remain competitive. Such approaches are well developed in cognate disciplines such as management, sociology and politics, among others. Adopting such approaches by working collaboratively with such disciplines can only strengthen the toolbox of economists and contribute to a better understanding of business.
