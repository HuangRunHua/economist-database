The astronomical revolution of the 17th century had shown that the solar system both operated according to the highest principles of reason and contained comets which might conceivably hit the Earth. The geological record, as interpreted by the Comte de Buffon, showed massive extinctions in which species vanished for ever. That set the scene for Charles Darwin to recognise such extinctions as the motor of evolution, and thus as both the force which had fashioned humans and, by implication, their possible destiny. The nascent science of thermodynamics added a cosmic dimension to the certainty of an ending; Sun, Earth and the whole shebang would eventually run down into a lifeless \u201cheat death\u201d.

The spur for this was the discovery, and later exploitation, of the power locked up in atomic nuclei.

And the tangible threat of imminent catastrophe which it posed rubbed off on other technologies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "None was more tainted than the computer. It may have been guilt by association: the computer played a vital role in the development of the nuclear arsenal. It may have been foreordained.

They produce prose, poetry and code; they generate images, sound and video; they make predictions based on patterns. It is easy to see that those capabilities bring with them a huge capacity for mischief.

The interface through which a user interacted with an application was separated from the application itself. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The power of the browser was immediately obvious. Fights over how hard users could be pushed towards a particular browser became a matter of high commercial drama. Almost any business with a web address could get funding, no matter what absurdity it promised. When boom turned to bust at the turn of the century there was a predictable backlash. But the fundamental separation of interface and application continued. Amazon, Meta (n\u00e9e Facebook) and Alphabet (n\u00e9e Google) rose to giddy heights by making the browser a conduit for goods, information and human connections.

Having been \u201ctrained\u201d not just on reams of text, but lots of code, they contain the building blocks of many possible programs; that lets them act as \u201cco-pilots\u201d for coders. Programmers on GitHub, an open-source coding site, are now using a GPT-4-based co-pilot to produce nearly half their code. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is no reason why this ability should not eventually allow LLMs to put code together on the fly, explains Kevin Scott, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer. The capacity to translate from one language to another includes, in principle and increasingly in practice, the ability to translate from language to code. A prompt written in English can in principle spur the production of a program that fulfils its requirements. Where browsers detached the user interface from the software application, LLMs are likely to dissolve both categories. This could mark a fundamental shift in both the way people use computers and the business models within which they do so.

Some, such as the incorporation of fictitious misdeeds to biographical sketches of living people, are both plausible and harmful. The hallucinations can be generated by contradictions in training sets and by LLMs being designed to produce coherence rather than truth.

It changed relations between God and man, man and woman, past and present. It allowed the mass distribution of opinions, the systematisation of bureaucracy, the accumulation of knowledge. It brought into being the notion of intellectual property and the possibility of its piracy. But that very breadth makes comparison almost unavoidable.
