Through the treaty Ukraine recognised that \u201cthere is only one China in the world\u201d and the People\u2019s Republic of China \u201cis the only legal government representing China\u201d. Ukraine agreed that \u201cTaiwan is an inseparable part of China\u201d. In return, China supported efforts to protect the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

Western democracies should be under no illusion about the scale of China\u2019s implicit ambition in cultivating a weak Russia.

This includes a new concept of conflict across a spectrum of information war, cyberwar and high-end hyper-war. In Mr Xi\u2019s worldview, treaties are merely instruments to constrain and confuse adversaries. Therefore, if China and its vassal Russia succeed there will be a return to the kind of world which preceded both world wars and the destruction of the very institutions which, since 1945, have helped to militate against extreme state aggression."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It would thus be helpful now to remind President Xi of China\u2019s responsibilities and its obligations under the China-Ukraine treaty, and to encourage him to cease his further support of Russia\u2019s illegal endeavours in Ukraine.

The column noted that many publishers rejected George Orwell\u2019s anti-Soviet masterpiece, \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d, out of fear of giving offence.

One publisher, Jonathan Cape, rejected the manuscript on the advice of Peter Smollett, an official at the British Ministry of Information. Smollett was later revealed to be a Soviet agent.
