One of thousands of Mixue franchise owners across Asia, Mr Salim says his business is so good he hopes to open more outlets this year. Mixue, a Chinese firm which built its brand selling flavoured teas and soft-serve ice-cream in smaller Chinese cities with relatively modest average incomes, is exporting its model across South-East Asia. Its nearly 22,000 franchised stores worldwide, by early last year, made it the fifth-largest fast-food chain in the world by outlet, behind McDonald\u2019s, Subway, Starbucks and KFC."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Part of the reason for Mixue\u2019s success is that it sells rising Asia\u2019s favourite drink: bubble (or \u201cboba\u201d) tea, a milky tea containing chewy tapioca balls. In China, the market for these newfangled, flavoured teas was twice that for coffee in 2021, with a $20bn turnover, according to Momentum Works, a research firm in Singapore. As growth has slowed in China, bubble-tea brands have set their sights on South-East Asia, where the market was worth $4bn. Several other large, Chinese, ready-made tea brands, including HeyTea, Nayuki Tea, ChaGee and Happy Lemon, have also moved into the region."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet no bubble-tea chain has spread faster than Mixue, which opened its first store in Vietnam in 2018. By March it had around 1,500 stores in Indonesia; the firm wants to double its presence there by the end of this year, says Andy Meitri Hartanto, Mixue Indonesia\u2019s franchise manager. The brand\u2019s bright red signage and snowman logo can already be found in malls, along dusty side streets and on shophouses across Indonesia. Many branches stock board games, magazines, picture books and soft toys. On weekends Mr Salim\u2019s outlet fills with parents taking their children out for ice-cream, while during the week his main customers are students and office workers looking for an affordable, comfortable place to study or work. An ice-cream costs just 8,000 rupiah ($0.50). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Almost all Mixue branches are franchises. Around 95% of the firm\u2019s 10.3bn yuan ($1.5bn) in revenue in 2021 came from selling ingredients, packaging and equipment to franchise-holders. Huge factories and extensive supply chains let it keep down the store-price of ice-creams and teas, according to Zheshang Securities, a Chinese broker. Around 90% of Mixue Indonesia\u2019s products are imported from China. But the company\u2019s Indonesia operation has grown to such an extent that it plans to start making ingredients locally, says Mr Hartanto. Mixue has also adapted to local conditions. The Indonesian Ulema Council, a religious body, declared Mixue halal in February. In a country with 230m Muslims, \u201cthis decision was a big deal\u201d, says Mr Salim."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mixue dates from 1997, when its founder, Zhang Hongchao, started selling shaved ice and drinks at a roadside stall in the central Chinese province of Henan. Yet it wasn\u2019t until videos of its mascot, a chubby snowman, singing the Mixue theme song went viral on Chinese social media a few years ago that the brand became a household name. Short videos on Mixue, which means \u201choney snow\u201d in Mandarin, have been viewed more than 17bn times on Douyin, TikTok\u2019s Chinese sister app."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unlike fancier bubble-tea brands, Mixue markets itself as cheap and cheerful, rather than trendy, both in China and South-East Asia. Its viral song has been translated into 20 languages and is often played relentlessly in its franchises. \u201cWhat it took our China team ten or 20 years to figure out, we\u2019ve been able to perfect in just one year by learning from their experiences,\u201d says Mr Hartanto."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mixue\u2019s biggest ambitions for growth are in countries with rapidly growing economies and many young people, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Yet over the past year Mixue stores have also opened in Australia, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, and the firm has registered its trademark in markets from Europe and America to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. It has announced plans for an initial public offering on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The singing snowman is coming your way. \u25a0"}], "id": 14}
