Now, instead of being arrested, if people are caught with substances including fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine and LSD, they are issued with citations, similar to speeding tickets, and fined up to $100. That fine is waived if the offender calls a hotline and has a health assessment.

Using the criminal-justice system to treat addiction \u201cwas a miserable failure\u201d, says Mike Schmidt.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although no one was in prison solely for possession before decriminalisation, a criminal record could make it harder to get a job or a house. Black Oregonians were 2.5 times more likely to be convicted of a possession felony than whites. \u201cPeople suffering from addiction need help, not criminal punishments,\u201d the campaign for the ballot measure proclaimed.

It is difficult to know what impact the policy has had on drug use in Oregon in the two years since\u2014especially as, in the country as a whole, use increased during the pandemic. But deaths from drugs rose sharply. The overdose death rate in Oregon almost doubled between 2019 and 2021, compared with a national rise of 50%. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Trying to get people into treatment through citations does not work, says Keith Humphreys of Stanford University. Without meaningful pressure on drug addicts, he says, \u201cthere is no mechanism at all to get them to change their behaviour.\u201d From the 4,000 citations issued in Oregon in the first two years of the policy, fewer than 200 people called the hotline and fewer than 40 were interested in treatment. It has cost taxpayers $7,000 per call. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFor a lot of people, the criminal-justice system is their rock-bottom,\u201d says Paige Clarkson, the district attorney in Oregon\u2019s Marion County. Law enforcement had been a tool to push people into treatment, she argues, and decriminalisation \u201ccompletely negated that tool\u201d. Few jails offer high-quality treatment, but across the country, in 2019, 27% of Americans entering public addiction treatment were sent by the criminal-justice system.

There, drug-induced deaths have since fallen and street dealing is uncommon. But Portugal\u2019s policy is different: offenders are taken to a police station and must go before a dissuasion panel at the Ministry of Health. Fully 80% of addicts then choose to start treatment. Repeat offenders face punishment, like being banned from bars, or community service, enforced by police. \u201cThe state still has a paternalistic approach,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Goul\u00e3o, one of the architects of Portugal\u2019s effort.

Addiction-support workers in Portland estimate that the wait for residential treatment can be up to three months. Recent state analysis found that it needed 60% more inpatient facilities.
