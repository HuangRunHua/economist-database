The national mapping agency is also important for managing land use and infrastructure. For centuries, though, no one had set out to systematically and accurately map the British isles in their entirety. It was not until the 19th century that os created the first comprehensive, detailed picture of Britain. Just as today\u2019s paper os maps fit together in a jigsaw that stretches over the country, when os began its cartographic project around 1800 it progressed sheet by sheet. The task would take eight decades and involved considerable hardship for the hundreds of surveyors employed to carry it out. We have pieced together these early maps, in a method pioneered by Living with Machines, a research project, to illustrate how the first efforts of os, rooted in military threats, adapted to keep up with a country being transformed by the Industrial Revolution."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In an enjoyable book, \u201cMap of a Nation\u201d, Rachel Hewitt tells the history of this first complete map. There is a clue to the original purpose of os maps in the agency\u2019s name: \u201cordnance\u201d means artillery and munitions. os grew out of the Board of Ordnance, a government body set up in Tudor times to help defend Britain. To see off invaders, you must know the lie of your land. os started around the time of the Napoleonic wars, when Europe splintered into a fractious set of alliances and Britain faced constant military threats."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The process of making these maps was slow, arduous and physical. The early os surveyors marched through remote countryside, weighed down with heavy instruments. They began by setting out an initial skeleton of locations, measured to a high degree of accuracy. The skeleton was connected in a mesh of triangles (see below). Further surveying could then fill in the details within the triangles. Laying out these triangles was done by first measuring a \u201cbaseline\u201d: the straight-line distance between two points. os first did this on Hounslow Heath, now in west London. Once surveyors knew the distance between the two ends of the baseline, they picked a faraway landmark (or \u201ctrig-point\u201d) and measured the angle to the landmark from each end of the baseline. Using trigonometry they calculated the distances between each point. They then continued, creating more triangles off the first one, until they had covered an entire area."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One of the instruments used by the surveyors for measuring these angles was a custom-built theodolite. This \u201cgreat\u201d theodolite, crafted in shining wood and metal, was a metre in all dimensions and weighed 90kg. Landmarks visible from afar tend to be high up; surveyors had to cart the theodolite to the top of mountains and winch it up the towers of castles and cathedrals to make measurements."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/interactive/britain/2023/04/06/how-intrepid-victorian-surveyors-mapped-the-length-and-breadth-of-britain/images/theodolite3_inverted.png", "imageWidth": 1168, "imageHeight": 1992, "imageDescription": "The great theodolite used by OS."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/interactive/britain/2023/04/06/how-intrepid-victorian-surveyors-mapped-the-length-and-breadth-of-britain/images/theodolite1.jpg", "imageWidth": 720, "imageHeight": 979, "imageDescription": "A similar theodolite used for surveying in India"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This back-breaking work eventually paid off. The French may never have invaded but the maps helped Britain to collect tax, manage agriculture and plan infrastructure. As the country has changed, so have its uses for maps. Printed maps beloved of countryside walkers account for just over 5% of os\u2019s revenues today. The agency is largely a geographic-data provider for government and businesses. os data is being used, for example, to plan the network of electric-car chargers helping Britain towards its net-zero emissions goal. The National Health Service used os data to track and trace infections during the coronavirus pandemic. And the agency\u2019s data is used to monitor the health of Britain\u2019s peatland, which is important for managing climate change."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today\u2019s mapping tools are very different from the early technologies. os\u2019s toolkit includes satellites which whip over Britain\u2019s quarter of a million square kilometres every day. More detailed aerial imagery is captured with planes and drones. But human surveyors have not disappeared entirely; os continues to employ more than 200. They may not be lumbered with the bulky equipment of the past, but they still have to brave the British weather, rain or shine. "}], "id": 40}
