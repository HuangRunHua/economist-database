On April 7th Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled against an abortion medication that has been used by millions of Americans with few complications. He entered a preliminary injunction nullifying the 23-year-old approval by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) of mifepristone, one of two drugs commonly used to end pregnancies in the first ten weeks of gestation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Kacsmaryk\u2019s extraordinary ruling\u2014the first time a judge has revoked the FDA\u2019s approval of a medication\u2014means that residents even of abortion-friendly states could face more obstacles to ending pregnancies. Yet the ruling did not take immediate effect: the judge gave the federal government seven days to lodge an appeal. Both the Department of Justice and Danco Laboratories, mifepristone\u2019s manufacturer, asked the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to keep the medication available. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is another twist. Less than an hour after Mr Kacsmaryk\u2019s order Thomas Rice, a federal judge in the state of Washington, issued an antithetical ruling prohibiting the FDA from ending Americans\u2019 access to mifepristone. The muddle of the competing verdicts led the Department of Justice to ask Mr Rice how his order jibes with the competing one so that the government may \u201ccomply with all court orders in these unusual circumstances\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling is ostensibly concerned with the purported health risks posed by mifepristone, which blocks progesterone, a pregnancy hormone, to women and girls. He agreed with the challengers\u2014a group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine\u2014that the FDA\u2019s approval of the drug in 2000 was rushed. The result, he wrote, has been \u201cmany deaths and many more severe or life-threatening adverse reactions\u201d than would have occurred had the \u201cFDA not acquiesced to the pressure to increase access to chemical abortion at the expense of women\u2019s safety\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Kacsmaryk brushed away studies showing that the drug is safe and effective. \u201cDue to FDA\u2019s lax reporting requirements\u201d, he wrote, the number of bad results is \u201clikely far higher than its data indicate\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Concern for women\u2019s health may be the stated reason for the lawsuit, but an antipathy to abortion was the primary motivation behind it. The plaintiffs filed their suit in a district where they would be sure to draw a judge known to be hostile to abortion. Before he was tapped for the court by Donald Trump in 2019 Mr Kacsmaryk worked at the First Liberty Institute, a conservative Christian legal organisation with a mission similar to that of the Alliance Defending Freedom, the group that argued the case against mifepristone in his court. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The judge endorsed even the plaintiffs\u2019 most aggressive contention. He agreed that a federal law called the Comstock Act, which dates from 1873, prohibits the mailing of any \u201carticle, instrument, substance, drug, medicine or thing\u201d that can be used to cause an abortion."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling thus contains the seeds of a sweeping anti-abortion agenda that goes well beyond the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v Wade last June. His interpretation of the Comstock Act could inspire a prohibition of all abortion in America, because under this reading shipments to clinics of any equipment used in abortion would be illegal. Mr Kacsmaryk also dropped another crumb for those pushing a nationwide abortion ban. His opinion contended that \u201cunborn humans extinguished by mifepristone\u201d are entitled to \u201cindividual justice\u201d. This concept of \u201cfetal personhood\u201d would grant fetuses the full panoply of constitutional rights, starting with a right to life. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In response to the Texas ruling President Joe Biden wrote that the court had \u201csubstituted its judgment\u201d for the FDA\u2019s. If such second-guessing were to stand, \u201cvirtually no\u201d FDA-approved medication \u201cwould be safe from these kinds of political, ideological attacks\u201d. Leaders of dozens of drug companies also weighed in against Mr Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling in a letter criticising the judge for creating \u201cuncertainty for the entire biopharma industry\u201d. And in a friend-of-the-court brief to the Fifth Circuit on April 11th, 169 industry leaders argued that, by overturning the FDA\u2019s drug-approval process, the ruling would \u201cchill crucial research\u201d, undermine investments and \u201cwreak havoc on drug development\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the Fifth Circuit is one of America\u2019s most conservative courts, and on April 12th it endorsed nearly all Mr Kacsmaryk\u2019s reasoning except his move revoking FDA authorisation of mifepristone in 2000. So the pill will still be available but, barring further judicial intervention, the standards for prescribing and dispensing it will be far stiffer. The chaos of conflicting rulings means the case seems headed to the Supreme Court. The question will be whether the five justices who overturned Roe will leave abortion rights to the states\u2014as they promised\u2014or empower the judiciary to be the last word on the subject. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 23}
