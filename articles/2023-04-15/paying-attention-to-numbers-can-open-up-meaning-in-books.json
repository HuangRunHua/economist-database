The avant-garde group sought new ways to tell stories; they revelled in constraint. In 1947 Raymond Queneau, the collective\u2019s co-founder, had imagined a single short story in 99 different ways in his \u201cExercises in Style\u201d. In 1969 Georges Perec wrote a novel that omitted the letter \u201ce\u201d. Three years later he produced a novella in which \u201ce\u201d was the only vowel used. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sarah Hart describes the work of Oulipo in \u201cOnce Upon a Prime\u201d as part of a wide-ranging analysis of the links between maths and literature. The author\u2014who in 2020 became the first woman to hold the position of Gresham Professor of Geometry, thought to be the oldest maths professorship in Britain\u2014seeks to prove that the disciplines are profoundly intertwined. \u201cThe perceived boundary between them is a very recent idea,\u201d she says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Professor Hart argues, convincingly, that paying attention to numbers can open up meaning in novels and poems; she explores the role maths plays in literary works such as \u201cJurassic Park\u201d, \u201cLife of Pi\u201d and \u201cMoby Dick\u201d. Mathematical allusions can provide insight into a writer\u2019s psyche, too. In \u201cWar and Peace\u201d Tolstoy \u201cuses calculus as a metaphor for understanding the whole of human history\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some novelists make maths the theme of their work. Lewis Carroll, a lecturer at Oxford University, combined fantastical escapades with references to puzzles, sums and numerical games in \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d. Alice uses a \u201cproof by contradiction\u201d to expose the Mock Turtle\u2019s lies about studying arithmetic. The theme of \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass\u201d, the sequel, was chess; Carroll included descriptive notation as part of the front matter. His abiding interest was in \u201cthe power and possibilities of logic\u201d, Professor Hart writes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Amor Towles, a banker turned bestselling author, gave his novel \u201cA Gentleman in Moscow\u201d a unique, \u201caccordion-like\u201d structure inspired by the power of two. The book covers a period of 32 years. The story starts on a summer solstice\u2014the midpoint of a year\u2014and returns to the characters in roughly doubling time spans (one day after, two days, five days, ten days, and so on) until the midpoint of the story. From there, the time frames grow shorter again: from eight years to four years, two years, and beyond. The effect, Professor Hart avers, is to mimic \u201cthe way human memory works, and how we experience the passage of time\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cOnce Upon a Prime\u201d analyses the \u201ccounting, pattern, and therefore mathematics\u201d involved in rhyme schemes and points out writers\u2019 love of prime numbers. (Consider the three witches in \u201cMacbeth\u201d and Snow White\u2019s seven dwarves.) The book shows how seemingly random dates or figures can contain hidden clues for the reader or hint at the theme of a story. It makes for illuminating prose and the reader may feel better equipped to tackle the books on their nightstand afterwards."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Professor Hart\u2019s book is also good fun, written in a light and accessible style. The author explains why giant spiders such as Aragog in \u201cHarry Potter\u201d cannot exist and why the Olympics in 2008 opened at eight minutes past eight o\u2019clock on the eighth day of the eighth month of the year. She furnishes her reader with tongue-in-cheek advice about how to break the record for writing the most limericks, how to optimise a pick-your-own-adventure story and how to decipher encrypted messages. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The book offers answers to some creative conundrums, too. Is 42 the answer to everything, as \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u201d suggested? How big would Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s library have to be to contain every possible book on Earth? Professor Hart tackles these questions with the rigour of a mathematician\u2014and the wit and creativity of a writer. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
