The French performer was celebrated not only for her enchanting voice, but also as \u201cthe queen of the pose and the princess of the gesture\u201d. She played the greatest roles written by Dumas, Moli\u00e8re and Shakespeare and is thought to have inspired the character of La Berma in Proust\u2019s \u201cIn Search of Lost Time\u201d. A new exhibition in Paris, \u201cAnd the woman created the star\u201d, marks the centenary of Bernhardt\u2019s death in March 1923.

The theatre company was prestigious, yet soon it was Bernhardt the public was flocking to see. After a successful tour of Britain she cut them loose and embarked on the first of several lucrative tours of America. She travelled in a manner appropriate to a modern-day diva, making use of a personal train carriage which carried her maid, cook and leading man. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The public was as enraptured by her unconventional private life as it was by her skill on the stage. Bernhardt was unapologetically, and publicly, promiscuous. It is thought her lovers included Victor Hugo\u2014when she was 27 and he 70\u2014Gustave Dor\u00e9 and the Prince of Wales, as well as a number of her fellow actors. She proudly raised her son, whom she claimed was fathered by a Belgian aristocrat, as a single mother.

It was Bernhardt herself who provided the press with a photograph of the coffin, for she understood the importance of self-mythologising. She cannily took advantage of the latest technology to disseminate her image around the world. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "She was photographed by F\u00e9lix Nadar, considered the first celebrity photographer, and employed Alphonse Mucha, an artist, to create posters of her using the new technique of lithography. Her name was used to sell everything from Pears Soap to Columbia bicycles. A short documentary made by France Culture, available on YouTube, argues that Bernhardt should be considered the first influencer."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unsurprisingly, she was drawn to the medium of film when it emerged. In 1900 a short recording was made of her turn as Hamlet, in which she can be seen duelling with Laertes. She starred as Queen Elizabeth I in a hit silent film of 1912, and it made her the first international movie star at the age of 68. A few years later she was the subject of one of the earliest \u201ccelebrity at home\u201d documentaries."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Bernhardt died in 1923, at the age of 79, hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets of Paris as her coffin was transported to P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery.
