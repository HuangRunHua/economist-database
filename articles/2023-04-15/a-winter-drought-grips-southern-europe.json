Fringed by red-tiled two-storey new-build homes, it has a gently growing population, which is boosted in the summer months by an influx of tourists and their kayaks. After yet another period of low rain, however, concern about dwindling water supplies has prompted Thierry Devimeux, the local prefect, to limit not just the use of water, but the expansion of the town altogether. It makes Vallon-Pont-d\u2019Arc the 22nd commune in the surrounding d\u00e9partement in which all new building has been banned.

Skiers have found that the snow cover in the Alps this season has been even patchier than in the already disappointing previous one, with Switzerland reporting record snow lows on many of its slopes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Alps are Europe\u2019s water-tower. They provide 25-50% of the water running through the continent\u2019s main rivers, the Danube, the Po, the Rhine and the Rh\u00f4ne. With so little snow to melt in the coming months, river levels are likely to be unusually low, and with them water supplies for the people and plants along their banks. Politicians realise the danger. On March 30th Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, chose to make his first visit outside Paris after recent protests against his pension reform to a depleted reservoir, the country\u2019s biggest, in south-east France. There he unveiled a 53-point plan to save 10% of water consumption by 2030. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On April 6th Italy\u2019s cabinet set up a crisis group to frame an emergency programme of action and gave it 30 days in which to report back. The country\u2019s water networks certainly need a lot of work. Last month, the Italian environment minister, Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, said that pipeline leakage averages a whopping 37% nationwide; he called it \u201ca waste we can no longer afford\u201d. In the province of Belluno in the north-east, 70% of the water, collected from springs, is lost on the way to consumers. Farmers in the north are already planning to plant less rice, which requires more water than other crops."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Spain\u2019s history has taught it some hard lessons in water management. The country is both high and dry, and has experienced drought throughout its recorded history. Researchers have dated the country\u2019s dry spells by noting in which years Muslim caliphs in al-Andalus and bishops in Christian Spain instructed clergy and the faithful to pray for rain. The country\u2019s familiarity with the scourge of drought has led it to prepare better. During the reign of Spain\u2019s dictator Francisco Franco (1939-1975) reservoir storage was expanded (with what many Spaniards remember as brutal efficiency) by a factor of ten."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That means Spain can just about cope, for now. But most of its water is in the north. In Spain\u2019s southern parts, which are separated by mountains from the wet north, reservoirs are running low. Those southern regions also produce much of the country\u2019s olive oil and a large share of Europe\u2019s vegetables, and will struggle to do so without water from the north."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such transfers are often unpopular. Three Spanish regions are taking the central government to court over cuts to an existing water-transfer scheme, in part because it would lead to the loss of 12,000 hectares-worth of agricultural output, according to one government agency. But the inauguration in March of a new water transfer from the Tagus river to La Mancha, a white windmill-dotted region in southern Spain, showed that water-sharing for human consumption is less controversial than for agriculture. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whether the next months will provide any relief for southern Europe is still unclear. \u201cSeasonal climate predictions show a warmer than usual spring-early summer, but how wet it will be is still very uncertain,\u201d says Andrea Toreti of the Copernicus European Drought Observatory, an EU research body. A dry spring could hit agriculture hard, raising food prices again. Depleted waterways may have to be closed to big barges, increasing transport costs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Low rainfall could also cause problems at Europe\u2019s hydroelectric plants, which produced a lot less in 2022 because of last year\u2019s drought. Their reservoirs are well filled in Spain, France and Switzerland, in part because governments intervened last year to keep levels up in case energy became scarce during the winter. The exception is Italy, where water for power generation is as low as it was in March last year, but with less snow in the Alps to refill the reservoirs as it melts. As droughts become more frequent, Europe has a long way to go before it is waterproof. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more coverage of climate change, sign up for The Climate Issue, our fortnightly subscriber-only newsletter, or visit our climate-change hub."}], "id": 35}
