Wager, a British frigate, crashed onto rocks off the coast of Patagonia while pursuing the enemy into the Pacific in 1741. The seas in that remote part of the world are infamous. \u201cBelow forty degrees latitude, there is no law,\u201d went a sailors\u2019 adage. \u201cBelow fifty degrees, there is no God.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A non-fiction account of the chase, the wreck and what followed might have been told as a typical maritime adventure. Those who love yarns involving cannon fire, sea-chests, plum duff and mainmasts will find \u201cThe Wager\u201d riveting, as will those less intrigued by the age of sail. In the hands of David Grann, the story transcends its naval setting. The author, whose previous bestsellers include \u201cThe Lost City of Z\u201d and \u201cThe White Darkness\u201d, is a master of exciting tales in far-flung places. He has produced a volume so dramatic and engrossing that it may surpass his previous books. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The tale revolves around three complex figures. Wager\u2019s captain, David Cheap, began to lose sway over the men as soon as the ship foundered. The crew became castaways on a small island in the Golfo de Penas (\u201cGulf of Pain\u201d). Just over half the original complement of 250 had survived outbreaks of typhus and scurvy onboard. Aloof and slow to adapt, Cheap derived his authority from the chain of command rather than natural charisma. But he was also physically brave and loyal to the mission, at one point single-handedly facing down a band of armed mutineers without a weapon of his own. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "By contrast, John Bulkeley \u201cemerged as a leader on his own merits\u201d. A working seaman whose job, as gunner, was to oversee the ship\u2019s cannon, he started foraging food, constructing shelter and bartering supplies from the moment his feet touched land. Others began looking to him for answers. Mr Grann writes that little is known about Bulkeley except that he was a devout Christian who swung hard in a fight. Yet he was no brute: he kept a detailed journal of Wager\u2019s travails, peppered with verse.

Sixteen years old when he volunteered for naval service, the young gentleman came from one of the oldest noble families in Britain. (His grandson would be the poet Lord Byron.) Mr Grann deftly shows how the trainee officer\u2019s allegiance shifted between the captain and the gunner, swayed by notions of pragmatism, duty, survival and, above all, decency. Like Bulkeley, Byron kept a journal that proved an important source for Mr Grann\u2019s book. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The marooned crew feuded over where to assign fault and how to get home. They soon split into bitter factions. An indelible scene portrays Cheap and Bulkeley shaking hands as they part ways, never again to reunite. The privations that the men endured over the following months and years are almost unimaginable. After the ravages of shipbound disease and a desperate rounding of Cape Horn, they faced starvation, cannibalism, exposure, abandonment and return journeys to civilisation in small, unseaworthy boats. Only a fraction survived. \u201cI believe no mortals have experienced more difficulties and miseries than we have,\u201d wrote one of their number. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The story\u2019s astonishing conclusion ought not to be spoiled, but \u201cThe Wager\u201d echoes several other recent tales that have pitted bearded men against each other in harsh times and places. Both \u201cThe Revenant\u201d by Michael Punke and \u201cThe North Water\u201d by Ian McGuire are fictional antecedents. \u201cThe Wager\u201d may be bound for similar success as, like those books, it looks headed for the screen. Apple Original Films has bought the rights, with Martin Scorsese attached to direct and Leonardo DiCaprio to star. (The pair is also behind \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d, based on another of Mr Grann\u2019s books; the movie will have its premiere at Cannes Film Festival next month.) Expect to hear more about the captain and the gunner. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
