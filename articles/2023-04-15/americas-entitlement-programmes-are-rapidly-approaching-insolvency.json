And two, they don\u2019t want to say what it is because all of its elements are things that their constituents hate, like getting rid of all federal spending that isn\u2019t defence,\u201d says Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island and the chairman of the powerful Budget Committee.

Having binged on nearly $5trn in net new spending since he took office, Mr Biden released a budget on March 9th that aims to subtract $3trn from the national debt over a decade, largely through tax increases that Republicans will reject. The plan says it will keep the Medicare fund solvent for 25 years by raising payroll taxes.

The senator suggests eliminating that limit, which benefits high earners. \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for taxpayers making under $160,000, why do billionaires get a free ride?\u201d If implemented today, doing so would probably cover 63% of the shortfall, according to calculations by the CRFB.
