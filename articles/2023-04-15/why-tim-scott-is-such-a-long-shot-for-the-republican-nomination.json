He announced on April 12th that he would form a presidential exploratory committee\u2014becoming the second figure from the Palmetto State, after Nikki Haley, a former governor, to join the fray. Hardly anyone in the party has a bad word to say about Mr Scott, who grew up from poverty with a single mother to become the first African-American senator to represent a Southern state since 1881. Polling of the state\u2019s Republicans, by Winthrop University, showed Mr Trump\u2019s support at 41%, with Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley close to 20% and Mr Scott back at 7%.
