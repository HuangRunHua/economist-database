He is likely to be called al-Qurayshi\u2014and is unlikely to live to a great age. On April 30th Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, announced that in an operation the day before, run by his country\u2019s intelligence agency, the latest leader of is, Abu Hussein al-Qurayshi, had been \u201cneutralised\u201d.

He, in turn, had succeeded Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. This one, holed up in the rebel-held Syrian province of Idlib, had blown up himself and his family when cornered in a firefight with American special forces in February last year.

It is unclear how much authority the name confers over what is now a much looser-knit, cell-based group after its ejection from its strongholds in Syria and Iraq.

In January last year, is fighters attacked Ghuwayran prison in that area in an attempt to free 3,000 of their comrades, many of them foreigners whom their own countries do not want back. The ten-day battle left more than 500 people dead, about three-quarters of them is prisoners, and required American and British special forces and air power to intervene before the Kurds could regain control. \u25a0"}], "id": 30}
