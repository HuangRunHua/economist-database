In the end, it wasn\u2019t even close. Santiago Pe\u00f1a, a 44-year-old former finance minister and economist at the IMF, took nearly 43% of votes in Paraguay\u2019s presidential election on April 30th. Mr Pe\u00f1a hails from the conservative Colorado Party that currently governs the country. By the time his five-year term, which begins on August 15th, is over, the Colorados will have held power for 75 out of the last 80 years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Pe\u00f1a\u2019s plans, though vague, clearly resonated with voters. \u201cHe says he\u2019s going to support young people who want to get on, that want to fulfil their dreams,\u201d says Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez, a 28-year-old builder heading into a polling station in Remansito, a suburb of Asunci\u00f3n, the capital. Advisers to Mr Pe\u00f1a say that a full manifesto will be drawn up soon. Paraguay\u2019s ultra-low tax rates and stable macroeconomic policies will probably remain unchanged.

Mr Alegre had lots of ideas, including locking up crooked politicians in a new jail in the mosquito-infested outback. Others would be banished farther afield. Mr Alegre suggested he would extradite Horacio Cartes\u2014Paraguay\u2019s president between 2013 and 2018 and the leader of the Colorado Party\u2014to the United States. In January the US government accused Mr Cartes of involvement in \u201crampant corruption\u201d and barred American firms from doing business with him. No extradition request or formal charges have been made. Mr Cartes denies all of the allegations.

A nationalist, anti-corruption firebrand, Mr Cubas was expelled from his senate seat in 2019 after brawling with his colleagues. Before that, \u201cPayo\u201d, as he is known, was infamous for attacking a judge with his belt before defecating in the judge\u2019s office. He said he would shut down Congress, rule with the army and put dishonest officials before firing squads. His movement, National Crusade, saw five senators elected, including one who is currently in jail. Mr Cubas\u2019s supporters took to the streets after the election result was announced, letting off fireworks outside the electoral authority, egged on by their leader, who called on them to \u201cdie if necessary\u201d. Meanwhile the Colorado Party lives on. \u25a0"}], "id": 35}
