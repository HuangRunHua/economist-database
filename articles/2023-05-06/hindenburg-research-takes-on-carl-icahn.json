Although it was swashbuckling corporate raids during the 1980s that made him infamous, some of Mr Icahn\u2019s earliest campaigns involved investing in closed-end funds, a type of investment company which often trades at a discount to the value of its assets. Closing this gap, perhaps by agitating for the fund to liquidate its holdings, yields a profit."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230506_WBC034.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Icahn\u2019s own investment holding company, Icahn Enterprises, suffered no such discount. Until this week the firm had a market capitalisation of around $18bn, more than triple the reported net value of its assets. These include majority ownership of energy and car companies, in addition to an activist-investment portfolio. On May 2nd Hindenburg Research, a short-selling outfit founded in 2017 by Nathan Anderson, accused Icahn Enterprises of operating a \u201cPonzi-like\u201d structure. Icahn Enterprises has shed more than a third of its market value since Hindenburg released its report. It has become the latest of Hindenburg\u2019s targets to hit the skids\u2014and the headlines. Mr Anderson\u2019s firm has previously taken aim at Nikola, a maker of electric lorries, the Adani Group, one of India\u2019s mightiest conglomerates, and Block, an American fintech giant (see chart)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hindenburg\u2019s latest report alleges that Icahn Enterprises has inflated the value of its assets and funded its dividend with proceeds from selling shares to unwitting investors. It also calls on Mr Icahn to disclose the terms of personal loans secured against his majority holding in Icahn Enterprises. And it scolds Jefferies, Mr Icahn\u2019s long-time investment bankers and the only big bank whose research analysts cover Icahn Enterprises, for allegedly turning a blind eye to the firm\u2019s risks. Mr Icahn, Hindenburg argues, \u201chas made a classic mistake of taking on too much leverage in the face of sustained losses\u201d. Bill Ackman, another famed activist investor who once locked horns with Mr Icahn over an investment in Herbalife, an American supplement firm, gloated on Twitter that there was a \u201ckarmic quality\u201d to the report. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Short-sellers\u2019 targets can be hamstrung in their immediate defences\u2014share prices can tank quickly but detailed rebuttals take time. Even so, Mr Icahn\u2019s first response looks muted compared with that of Hindenburg\u2019s recent victims. In March Block described Hindenburg\u2019s report as \u201cfactually inaccurate\u201d and threatened litigation. In January the Adani Group accused the short-seller of \u201cselective misinformation\u201d. After stating that Hindenburg\u2019s report is \u201cself-serving\u201d, Mr Icahn said on May 2nd merely that his firm\u2019s performance would \u201cspeak for itself\u201d. Jefferies has not commented on Hindenburg\u2019s claims. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Quite how messy this activist showdown becomes remains to be seen. Hindenburg\u2019s report pitches a doyen of classic shareholder activism, which involves trying to drive a target\u2019s share price up, against a newly prominent practitioner of short-selling, which aims to send it through the floor. The stakes are higher for Mr Icahn. His brand of activism requires investors to take him more seriously than they do the bad managers that, in his \u201canti-Darwinian\u201d view, American commerce seems to promote. Icahn Enterprises must now prove that the same thing is not true of its own boardroom. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 53}
