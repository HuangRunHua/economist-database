He has never seemed that keen on this hat. At the age of 20, King Charles III described the realisation he would be king as dawning upon him \u201cwith the most ghastly inexorable sense\u201d. His predecessors were little keener. King Edward VIII described kingship as \u201can occupation of considerable drudgery\u201d; King George VI awoke on the morning of his coronation with \u201ca sinking feeling\u201d.

The reminder is needed, for the list of those participating this weekend includes people with such titles as the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant, the Rouge Croix Pursuivant and the Portcullis Pursuivant. It involves a Garter King of Arms and people with titles so antique that their adjectives appear to be on back-to-front (the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of this realm). It involves beadles, heralds, princesses, kings, queens and His Most Godly Beatitude Theophilos III, Patriarch of Jerusalem and All Palestine. There are \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d episodes with more sober cast lists. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The ceremony that will unfold in Westminster Abbey is little more sensible. It includes a Stone of Destiny, a Sword of Spiritual Justice and oil made with olives harvested from the Monastery of Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem. It demands bowing, scraping, chanting and anointing with chrism from a special Coronation Spoon. It involves far too many men in tights. It has caused the British government\u2019s website\u2014which usually offers clarification on such things as self-assessment tax-return deadlines (January 31st)\u2014to start offering clarification on what the Earl of Erroll will be carrying on the day (a silver baton)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Monarchy, as even monarchs are apt to point out, doesn\u2019t belong in the modern world. \u201cReally, the day for kings and princes is past,\u201d wrote the future Edward VIII in 1920. \u201cMonarchies are out-of-date.\u201d The 20th century tended to agree. It opened with King Umberto I of Italy being shot by an assassin in 1900. For many royals, things only got worse. The assassinations of the kings of Portugal, Greece and the Tsar of Russia followed; others were booted out.
