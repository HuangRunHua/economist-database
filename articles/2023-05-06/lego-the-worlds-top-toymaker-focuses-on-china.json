And indeed, China has brought much joy to the world\u2019s top toymaker by revenue. Brick by brick, the Danish company has built up its business in the country, which is increasingly central to the firm\u2019s future. Last year over 60% of the new shops opened by Lego were in China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That brings with it unique challenges. In 2015, for example, Lego refused to sell bricks to Ai Weiwei, a Chinese artist known for criticising Communist Party leaders. Mr Ai planned to use the toys in a piece on dissidents. The company eventually backed down, saying it would no longer query the purpose of large orders. More recently, a rainbow-coloured set that celebrates inclusivity, called \u201cEveryone is Awesome\u201d, stopped being available in China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the focus on China has also led to interesting new creations aimed at the local market. In recent years Lego has released a number of sets that evoke the country\u2019s culture. The latest include a traditional lunar-new-year display and a Chinese money tree adorned with red envelopes. Duplo, a Lego line aimed at younger children, has produced a \u201cLearn about Chinese culture\u201d model that incorporates red lanterns and a Mahjong set."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lego\u2019s \u201cMonkie Kid\u201d theme is inspired by \u201cJourney to the West\u201d, a 16th-century Chinese legend. Of course, the original monkey king did not have a \u201cdragon jet\u201d or \u201cgalactic explorer\u201d. But these sets seem in line with the party\u2019s push to build \u201ccultural confidence\u201d. So too does \u201cLego Masters\u201d, the local version of a reality-TV show in which adult builders compete. Each episode is inspired by \u201cthe profound Chinese traditional culture\u201d, says its broadcaster, Shenzhen Media Group."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Staying on good terms with the party is a common challenge for firms in China. So is protecting intellectual property. Lego has dozens of Chinese competitors. And it has fought several successful copyright battles against imitators selling cheaper sets that resemble its own. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some rivals are taking a different approach. Though it produces \u201cstarfighters\u201d and \u201cspider tanks\u201d, Lego refuses to make true-to-life models of military equipment. Chinese firms are filling the gap. According to Sixth Tone, a Chinese news site, local toymakers are taking inspiration from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, creating Lego-like models of J-20 fighter jets, DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missiles and other Chinese weapons. Some fans are using the creations to make stop-motion animated films that re-enact historical battles."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Chinese toymakers are fighting an asymmetric war. Lego has hundreds of stores in China. Last year it opened 95 new ones, including a big flagship branch in the western city of Chongqing. This year it plans to open 80 more. It, too, is on the offensive.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 20}
