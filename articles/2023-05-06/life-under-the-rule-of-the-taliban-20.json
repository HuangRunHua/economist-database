The hawaladars had foiled previous efforts by Ashraf Ghani, the country\u2019s last NATO-backed leader, and his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, to regulate their largely untaxed trade. Yet the Taliban government has proved a more committed reformer. It has forced the hawaladars to keep computerised records and follow \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d requirements. Non-compliant businesses have been shut down.

But al-Qaeda is globally at its lowest ebb, superseded by Islamic State (IS), a terrorist outfit spawned by the wars in Syria and Iraq. And the Taliban are attacking IS\u2019s local affiliate\u2014which they consider a deadly rival\u2014in its rugged hideouts in eastern Afghanistan and elsewhere.

It did not have the means to stabilise the currency through bulk-buying, as America had frozen $9.5bn of Afghanistan\u2019s foreign-currency reserves. The Taliban therefore stanched the flow of dollars leaving the country by imposing harsh capital controls, a crackdown on smuggling and the hawala overhaul. The Afghani stabilised and is now just 7% lower against the dollar than it was the day before Kabul fell."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Taliban have improved economic-law enforcement across the board.

The threat of sharia-law punishments, including hand amputation, deters customs officials from taking bribes, notes an adviser to Mullah Baradar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic strategy. \u201cThe core competency of the Taliban government is the enforcement of laws and orders,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we find you are doing corruption and we implement sharia laws on you, you will not do corruption again.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To acknowledge such progress is less a tribute to the Taliban\u2019s harsh methods than an indictment of the corrupt, NATO-backed governments the Islamists replaced.

Their reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, is a malign figure, responsible for ratcheting up curbs on women from his Kandahar base. Yet the Taliban cabinet in Kabul includes able pragmatists."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Afghanistan\u2019s rulers are also assisted by the fact that they, unlike their immediate predecessors, do not have to contend with their own insurgency. It killed an estimated 69,000 soldiers and police between 2001 and 2021 and made economic development perilous or impossible in much of the country. Because companies no longer have to pay for private security, the cost of building projects has fallen by more than 50%, say businessmen in Kabul.
