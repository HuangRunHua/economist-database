Last week it directed local security forces to \u201capply the law\u201d. Parties across the political spectrum have backed the government\u2019s efforts, as have local television stations.

Exact numbers are unknown; the government ordered unhcr, the un refugee agency, to stop registering them in 2015. The official figure is 1.5m; the reality may be closer to 2m, in a country with a population of 5m. The government has refused to house Syrians in formal camps so they are scattered around the country (see map), many in squalid informal settlements.

But the latest campaign has been prompted in part by Lebanon\u2019s economic crisis\u2014and is all the more furious as a result.

Most Lebanese struggle to pay their bills."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The refugees are a convenient scapegoat. Locals blame them for crime waves and stealing jobs.

They have so far failed even to agree on a successor to Mr Aoun, who stood down last October. Pushing through reforms agreed with the imf, which would unleash billions of dollars in aid, looks far beyond them.

A large majority cannot make ends meet. Few receive the maximum benefits, which for a family of five or more are the equivalent of $80 (\u00a364) per month. The unhcr says this does not come close to covering a family\u2019s basic needs. They even have to pay rent for tents in remote areas. At a donors\u2019 conference in Brussels in mid-June, the un will ask for $4bn for Lebanon. More of the money will go to Lebanese than Syrians.

Some cross back into Syria then return to claim benefits from the un. But if Lebanon gets too heavy-handed with Syrian refugees it could forfeit the support of international donors.
