Historians, however, have a less rosy view. The journals and logs that have survived from the era do not paint an especially pretty picture of conditions aboard.

Written by Eva Panagiotakopulu, an entomologist at the University of Edinburgh, and Ana Catarina Garcia, an archaeologist at Nova University in Lisbon, and published in Biological Invasions, the paper examines two shipwrecks off the Azores, both of which date to about 1650. The first, known as Angra C, is thought to be a Dutch ship; the second, Angra D, was Spanish. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Expeditions to both wrecks have recovered everything from ropes, tools and buckets to wheat grains and decking planks\u2014as well as the remains of various species of insects. The researchers were interested in how sailing ships ferried invasive species from one continent to another. But their findings also shed light on the unpleasant realities of life at sea in the 17th century. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Among the preserved insect parts were wings from the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana. (Despite its name, it is not originally from America.) Aside from its distinct lack of charisma, this species lives off waste and spreads serious diseases including salmonella. More than 30 individual flies from a species called Dohrniphora cornuta were also identified. It is often found living in rotten food, and is also fond of sewage. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Piophila casei is another fly known as the \u201ccheese skipper\u201d. It lays its eggs on cheeses, dried meats and smoked fish. It also has an appetite for rotting human flesh, and gets its name because its larvae readily \u201cskip\u201d from corpses to food. The researchers also dug up the remains of Teichomyza fusca, widely known as the \u201curine fly\u201d because its larvae thrive in urine-soaked wood.

Drs Garcia and Panagiotakopulu\u2019s stomach-turning findings suggest it was.
