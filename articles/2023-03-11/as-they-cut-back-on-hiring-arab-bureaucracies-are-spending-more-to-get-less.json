Many citizens saw make-work jobs in the civil service as a birthright. Sluggish state-run firms, which often ran at a loss, added more fat to the public payroll. Wage bills consumed a big chunk of revenue, leaving little to spend on health, education or capital investments."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is starting to change. As a percentage of total employment, the public sector is shrinking in many Arab countries. About 20% of working Egyptians were employed by the government in 2021, down from 27% a decade ago, reckons the International Labour Organisation. The absolute number of civil servants has dropped as well. These figures are still high. In the OECD, a club of rich countries, the average share of public employment is 18%.

It can also help expand the middle class and reduce income inequality, as it did in mid-century Egypt, or serve as an effective (if expensive) way to hoover up lots of unemployed young people.

Hiring surged during the mid-2000s\u2019 oil boom: from 2005 to 2015 the state laid on almost half a million workers. Then it stopped. Since 2016 the number of governmental employees has grown by just 2%, according to central-bank data.
