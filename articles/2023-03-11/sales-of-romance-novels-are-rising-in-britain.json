Online, and particularly on TikTok, romantic fiction is being carved into categories by its fans. Where once people merely read a category called \u201cbooks\u201d now they read categories called #friendstolovers, #enemiestolovers and #academicrivalstolovers. There is #spicytok and there is #smuttok; there is #forbiddenlove and there is the slightly creepy #forcedproximity. Feminism is not this movement\u2019s strong suit. There is a category called #billionaireromance; there is no category named #earningsparity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Progressive or not, the hashtags are shifting books. Thanks in part to TikTok memes, sales of romance and saga fiction in Britain have risen by 110% in three years, to \u00a353m ($64m) a year\u2014their highest figure in a decade, according to figures from Nielsen BookData. Publishers have started to take notice. For many years the industry had regarded romantic fiction with Darcy-like disdain but now its pulse is quickening. Bookshops no longer stash books with pink covers at the back of shops but put them on tables near the tills; publishers are learning to brave the word \u201cheartwarming\u201d without embarrassment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is thought the rise in romance is due, in part, to the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for escapist fiction,\u201d says Molly Crawford, editorial director at Simon &amp; Schuster UK. But it is also perhaps because the genre lends itself so readily to filters and personalisation. Antique poets might have claimed love was as limitless as the stars but romantic fiction, however good, has always been prone to tropes. A large number of old novels already fit these new paradigms perfectly: online, \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d is now categorised as #enemiestolovers. As P.D. James, a novelist, once observed, Jane Austen novels are merely \u201cMills &amp; Boon written by a genius\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mills &amp; Boon itself is marketed by a genius. Long before most Tiktokers were born, the romantic publisher had cornered the market in categories. Its website offers the drop-dead gorgeous in drop-down menus, with entries for such things as \u201cHistorical\u201d, \u201cMedical\u201d and \u201cDesire\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Mills &amp; Boon search bar is a kind of census of female desire. Type in \u201cItalian\u201d, and you will be offered 338 titles; \u201cSheikh\u201d brings up 282; and \u201cWelsh\u201d four. \u201cBrooding\u201d returns 66 results, while \u201cCheerful\u201d produces zero. \u201cBillionaire\u201d offers you 754, \u201cSurgeon\u201d 206 and \u201cDoctor\u201d 380 (though to judge by titles such as \u201cBaby Surprise for the Doctor Prince\u201d and \u201cA Doctor in Her Stocking\u201d, neither the doctor\u2019s knowledge nor his morals would seem to deserve such reverence). \u201cMiddle Manager\u201d returns the pitiless phrase: \u201cSorry, no products matched the keyword.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Middle managers aside, tastes vary when it comes to romantic fiction. Elisabeth Kendall is mistress (the title feels unusually apposite) of Girton College, Cambridge and a world expert in jihadi chick lit. In \u201cI Fell In Love With a Jihadi Fighter\u201d, two distant cousins are thrown together in the same house in the Syrian civil war (#forcedproximity). Smouldering glances are followed, somewhat unexpectedly, by the hero\u2019s death. Happily all is not lost because, as Dr Kendall explains, \u201cthe woman decides she wants to join him\u201d and so the rest of the novel is about \u201cher metamorphosis into a suicide-bomber\u201d. The smouldering resumes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The novels that straddle the romance-bestseller charts in Britain strike a different tone. Many are modern and American; all have taut-jawed heroes and a fondness for exposition. In one, a #billionaire checks his \u201cPatek Philippe watch. Limited edition, hermetically sealed and waterproof, the stainless-steel timepiece had set [him] back a cool twenty grand.\u201d It\u2019s almost like reading Austen. In another, a surgeon hero has a habit of uttering such improbable sentences as: \u201cI get to perform a very rare\u2026craniopagus separation on Monday\u201d and \u201cI think I like you too much\u201d and \u201cYour mother is wonderful, by the way.\u201d (Naturally he turns out to be a monster.)

The covers of historical bestsellers feature winsome women in shawls; their plot lines feature pirates, illegitimate children and a liberal supply of scoundrels.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Romance is a genre with great continuity. But as Sharon Kendrick, a bestselling Mills &amp; Boon author, points out, the past few years have left their mark.
