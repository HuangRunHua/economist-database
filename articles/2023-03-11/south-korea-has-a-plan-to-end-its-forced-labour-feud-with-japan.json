When her head teacher suggested she should study in Japan, the country\u2019s colonial ruler, she enthusiastically agreed. Aged only 13, she forged the necessary documents and left her home in South Jeolla province. She was promptly dispatched not to the promised school in Japan, but to an aeroplane factory run by Mitsubishi, a Japanese conglomerate. \u201cI was worked almost to death and never paid,\u201d she recalls. Her last hope, she says, is that \u201cthe offenders will offer a sincere apology before I die\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She may at least be offered some hard cash. On March 6th the government of Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea\u2019s president, announced a new compensation fund for victims of Japanese wartime forced labour or their surviving relatives. The details\u2014including, crucially, whether Mitsubishi or any Japanese firm will pay into it\u2014are unclear. Yet Mr Yoon hopes this will end a dispute that has for decades poisoned the two countries\u2019 relations, even as American pressure and worries about China and North Korea draw them closer. Joe Biden, America\u2019s president, hailed the announcement as \u201ca groundbreaking new chapter of co-operation and partnership\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It follows a ruling by South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court, in 2018, that two Japanese companies, Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, must compensate South Koreans, or their surviving relatives, who were forced to work in their factories. Japan\u2019s government objected, saying the issue had been settled by a treaty between the two countries in 1965. A stand-off ensued, raising the prospect that Japanese firms such as Mitsubishi would have their South Korean assets seized by the court. Since Mr Yoon came to power last May, officials in Seoul and Tokyo have been engaged in a closed-door effort to patch things up."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The compensation fund will be filled mostly or entirely by South Korea\u2019s government. South Korean companies that received money under the 1965 treaty (which included $800m in grants and low-interest loans to South Korea) will be encouraged but not forced to contribute. Japanese firms may do so on a voluntary basis. Meanwhile Japan\u2019s government, instead of issuing a fresh apology, will reissue the \u201cdeep remorse and heartfelt apology\u201d it offered in 1998 for the \u201ctremendous damage and suffering\u201d caused by the Japanese colonial occupation of Korea in 1910-45."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The formula reflects how little Kishida Fumio, Japan\u2019s prime minister, felt able to compromise. He fears upsetting the right of his Liberal Democratic Party, which is against any new apology. Mr Kishida hailed the fund as a \u201creturn to a healthy relationship\u201d. Within hours, Japan\u2019s trade ministry announced bilateral talks on lifting controls, in place since 2019, on exports to South Korea of materials for semiconductor manufacturing. (South Korea said it would suspend a related complaint that it had lodged with the World Trade Organisation.) On March 9th the two countries announced that Mr Yoon would make an official visit to Japan the following week. He may also be welcomed as a guest at the G7 summit in Hiroshima in May. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The South Korean leader still has to sell his fix domestically. His push for better bilateral relations rests on an appeal to South Koreans to weigh the benefits of co-operating with Japan against their grievance over its past abuses. In a speech on March 1st, a day that commemorates Korean independence, Mr Yoon said Japan had transformed itself from a \u201cmilitaristic aggressor of the past into a partner that shares the same universal values\u201d. But he may fail to placate either the victims of Japanese forced labour or his political opponents."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lim Jae-sung, a lawyer acting for 15 plaintiffs in relation to Nippon Steel\u2019s use of forced labour, argues that, for the fund to work as hoped, each will have to renounce his or her claim to compensation from the Japanese firm. And some of them, he suggested, will insist that Nippon Steel must itself apologise and pay up. \u201cHow will we be able to accept this when there is not one apology, not one yen?\u201d he asks."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most South Koreans want better relations with Japan. Yet a recent poll suggests 64% consider a further apology from Japan and an investigation into its past wrongdoing to be prerequisites. And Mr Yoon\u2019s opponents will inflame that feeling. Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the opposition party, has accused the government of \u201ctreating forced-labour victims as if they are a stumbling-block to the improvement of relations\u201d. Much the same charge helped undo a \u201cfinal and irreversible resolution\u201d of the issue of Korean women forced into wartime sexual slavery by Japan, negotiated by the two countries in 2015. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As dusk fell on March 6th, protesters against the deal gathered outside Seoul\u2019s city hall. Candlelit signs decried Mr Yoon\u2019s \u201chumiliating pro-Japanese diplomacy\u201d and America\u2019s support for it. The big question is whether Mr Yoon has done more to soothe the anger, or to stoke it. \u25a0"}]}
