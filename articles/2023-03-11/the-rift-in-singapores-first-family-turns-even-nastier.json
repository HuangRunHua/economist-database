Lee wanted no monument apart from a thriving Singapore."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He tried hard, even from beyond the grave, to preclude the establishment of one potential memorial in particular: the colonial-era bungalow at 38 Oxley Road where he had lived from 1945 until his death. Lee left instructions for it to be bulldozed. Instead, the house, still very much standing, has become the focus of a bitter dispute between his three children. One of them, Lee Hsien Loong, has been Singapore\u2019s prime minister since 2004; another, his daughter Lee Wei Ling, in ill health, lives in the house; the third, their brother Lee Hsien Yang, is being investigated for perjury over the row and has fled the country."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The squabble has gripped Singaporeans, and no wonder. It is hard to think of a better allegory for the island-state\u2019s power politics and economic development than an intra-Lee family dispute over a British-era property. The disagreement centres on the handling of Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s will, the last of seven iterations. Signed in December 2013, it was handled not by his usual solicitor but by his daughter-in-law, Lee Hsien Yang\u2019s wife Lee Suet Fern, and her law firm. Like most earlier drafts, it contained what has become known as \u201cthe demolition clause\u201d, instructing that the house should be demolished either immediately after Lee\u2019s death or, if Lee Wei Ling still wanted to live in it, as soon as she had moved out. Singapore\u2019s founding father must have felt strongly about this\u2014it was the one clause in his will he wanted made public. His elder son, the current prime minister, once described him as \u201cunwavering\u201d on the issue."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2017 a family dispute over the house\u2019s fate became public when Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling issued a long statement accusing their brother, the prime minister, of being \u201cbehind what was represented to the family as a government initiative to preserve the house\u201d. The rift has since widened. Lee Suet Fern\u2019s role in the execution of the final will was officially investigated and in 2020 she was suspended as a lawyer for 15 months\u2014even though she was not found to have acted dishonestly in her dealings with her father-in-law. Her husband, Lee Hsien Yang, joined the political opposition, campaigning for the small Progress Singapore Party at a general election that year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The couple, now living in exile, were on a trip to Singapore last June when they were visited early one morning by two senior policemen. Rather than report for a formal police interview as requested, they promptly rushed to the airport. These events were made public only on March 2nd in a senior minister\u2019s written answer to a parliamentary question about the house controversy. He said the couple were under investigation for having given false evidence in the proceedings against Lee Suet Fern."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lee Hsien Yang believes this revelation was intended to thwart his ambition. Singapore will hold a presidential election between June and October, and he has hinted at running. The presidency is a largely ceremonial role, but has important veto powers. And Lee Hsien Yang had been a plausible contender. The office, held in six-year terms, is rotated around Singapore\u2019s biggest ethnic communities. This year\u2019s contest will be \u201copen\u201d\u2014meaning that candidates from the ethnic-Chinese majority, to which the Lee family belongs, can stand. Lee Hsien Yang is also one of the few people who could meet the strict criteria for candidates from the private sector, having been chief executive of Singapore Telecommunications for 12 years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A big believer in both meritocracy and the power of heredity, Lee Kuan Yew would not be perturbed that a son of his should occupy his former office. He might even have taken in stride another son running for president as, in effect, an opposition candidate. But that now seems unlikely to happen. It could not be done from exile. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even were Lee Hsien Yang to run, Lee Hsien Loong, like his father, loses few political battles. A son of Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Suet Fern, the Harvard economist Li Shengwu, acknowledged his uncle\u2019s clout in a tweet. \u201cMany families have vindictive relatives. My relatives just happen to control a small authoritarian government.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia:New Zealand is right to atone for its colonial crimes in the Pacific (Mar 2nd)Keeping up with the Tokugawas (Feb 23rd)After silencing critics at home, Narendra Modi goes after foreign media (Feb 16th)"}]}
