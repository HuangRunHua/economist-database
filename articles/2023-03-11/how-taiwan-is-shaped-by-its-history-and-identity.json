One side pays homage to the ROC. Dark display chests hold its founding charter. Two sleek black Cadillacs that once carried Chiang around Taipei hint at the glamour of ruling one of the world\u2019s richest political parties. On the other side a new exhibit decries the KMT\u2019s brutal dictatorship. Poems about censorship evoke the stark drama of a prison cell.

The second displays a decades-long struggle for democratic rights.

Instead the Taiwanese were forced to adopt the Mandarin Chinese language and to watch as the KMT plundered the island\u2019s resources to support its war. When Taiwanese people protested in 1947, KMT troops slaughtered an estimated 18,000-28,000 in what became known as the February 28th massacre. In 1949 the KMT imposed martial law on Taiwan, beginning a four-decade period of suppression often called the \u201cwhite terror\u201d."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230304_SRC551.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 1169.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The KMT asserted control over every aspect of life, using surveillance, propaganda and censorship reminiscent of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s. Its army served the party more than the country, and it had two enemies: communist spies and independence activists. At least 140,000 people were imprisoned, including many from the intellectual elite. Taiwanese activists suffered arrests, executions and exile in their 40-year fight for democracy. Only in 1987 did the KMT drop martial law. Only in 1996 did Taiwan hold its first competitive presidential election. In 2000 Taiwan elected its first opposition president and vice-president, Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu (a former political prisoner)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Taiwan today feels a long way from this past.

Mr Tsao is a 70-year-old author of a collection of oral histories from female survivors of KMT concentration camps set up in the 1950s on an island off Taiwan. Several thousand prisoners, including nearly a hundred women, were subjected to political re-education and forced labour. In 1953 some rebelled against camp demands that they write nationalist slogans in blood and tattoo them on their bodies. Fourteen prisoners were executed. It is a chilling parallel to the labour camps the Chinese Communist Party has always run. That is why Mr Tsao collected his accounts, he says. Taiwan must understand its history to avoid repeating it. China\u2019s ambassador to France recently said Taiwanese citizens will need \u201cre-education\u201d after reunification."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Tsao\u2019s book of oral histories was turned into a film, \u201cUntold Herstory\u201d, last October. \u201cThe whole point of the film was to say, don\u2019t be so quick to draw lines between you and me,\u201d he says. He included complex characters who were at once collaborators and victims of an authoritarian system, in the hope of encouraging more nuanced reflection on the period. Yet public reaction to the film was \u201cdisappointing\u201d, he says. Even before it came out, KMT supporters were criticising it as a distortion of the truth. It was released just before local elections, sparking accusations that this was done to win the DPP votes. One cinema in central Taiwan had to stop screening the film after online attacks.
