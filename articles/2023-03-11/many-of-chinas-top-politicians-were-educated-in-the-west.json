The Russians, in turn, hoped the study programmes would give them lasting influence over their Chinese comrades, many of whom would rise to positions of great power. But within a decade of becoming communist, China began squabbling with the Soviet Union. In 1961 leaders in Beijing denounced Soviet communism as the work of \u201crevisionist traitors\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The episode holds sobering lessons for Western countries, which have hosted millions of Chinese students over the past four decades\u2014many of whom have risen to positions of great power. While universities raked in cash, Western leaders hoped the experience would endear future Chinese leaders to liberal values. But, as with the Russians, they have been disappointed. Today the party is more anti-Western than it has been in decades, a mood reflected in the words of President Xi Jinping and Qin Gang, the foreign minister, at a meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress this month."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Foreign-educated students who return to China are known as haigui (sea turtles), a homophone for \u201creturning home from abroad\u201d. For a long time those who entered China\u2019s bureaucracy found themselves swimming upstream. While their technical knowledge was valued, the party feared that they might have divided loyalties. But as the number of haigui swelled, the distrust faded."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today over 20% of Central Committee members\u2014the 370 most powerful party officials in China\u2014have had some foreign education, mostly at Western universities. That is up from 6% two decades ago, according to Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington. Eight of the 24 members of the Politburo have studied in Western countries, the most ever by far."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like many overseas Chinese students today, the leaders often focused on STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). A Politburo member called Chen Jining, who is the party boss of Shanghai, spent a decade in Britain studying engineering. Another member, Yuan Jiajun, studied at Germany\u2019s centre for aerospace research. He later ran the rocket programme that sent the first Chinese man into space. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But there was demand for other subjects, too. In 2002 Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, working with Chinese institutions, set up a three-month programme to teach mid-ranking Chinese officials about administration. Similar short-term programmes sprang up at universities elsewhere in America and the West. (Some, such as Harvard\u2019s, were later shut down.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Despite all this, an anti-Western spirit permeates the leadership. State directives rage against \u201cerroneous\u201d Western ideas, such as having an independent judiciary. Students in China\u2019s schools are warned not to be misled by foreign concepts. In February a teacher in Anhui province was denounced by a student for \u201cworshipping the West and pandering to foreign powers\u201d after he encouraged students to study abroad. Never mind that China\u2019s education minister, Huai Jinpeng, was a visiting scholar at America\u2019s Columbia University in the 1990s."}, {"role": "body", "text": "President Xi Jinping studied only in China. But his ideological tsar, Wang Huning, was a visiting scholar in America in 1988. He wrote a book about his experience which revealed admiration for some aspects of the country, such as the way presidents reliably leave office when their term ends (Mr Xi will soon be confirmed for a norm-busting third term). But, Mr Wang wrote, there were \u201cundercurrents of crisis\u201d caused by racial tensions, disintegrating families and poor education. For him, America mostly offered a lesson in what to avoid."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}]}
