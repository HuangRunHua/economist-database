James Stewart and Rachel Abrams, two New York Times journalists, have put together a deeply reported account of his final years, delving in sometimes excruciating detail into his extraordinary antics in both the boardroom and the bedroom."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After a scholarship to Harvard, where he learned Japanese and later helped crack codes in the second world war, Redstone saw off his brother to inherit control of the Boston-based family business, National Amusements, which ran two drive-in cinemas. He went on to amass one of the world\u2019s largest collections of entertainment assets, with controlling stakes in Viacom and cbs, combined before his death to form what is now Paramount Global."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though he earned a multi-billion-dollar fortune and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, he was also \u201cbanned from every restaurant in LA\u201d, in the words of one long-suffering dining companion. He described Barack Obama using the N-word and faxed his daughter, Shari, to call her the C-word, copying executives at Viacom, where she was on the board. He harassed his female staff, asking an attendant on a company jet if she liked to be spanked."}, {"role": "body", "text": "His exploitation of younger women\u2014and, as he became infirm, their exploitation of him\u2014is the focus of the first half of \u201cUnscripted\u201d. To buy their affection and discretion, Redstone doled out favours, gifts and cash. Favourites got career leg-ups; one, a singer in a band called the Electric Barbarellas, performed on CBS at his insistence. Towards the end of his life, two live-in girlfriends-cum-nurses extracted $150m from him. Finally his family evicted the pair, with the help of private detectives and a lot of lawyers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second half of the book concerns the Redstone businesses, where Sumner remained executive chairman even as he had to be carried into annual meetings at which he barely spoke. Later, as his voice deteriorated, he had a laptop programmed to say phrases including \u201cWould you like some fruit salad?\u201d and \u201cFuck you.\u201d After a legal hearing in which he struggled to recall his birth name (Rothstein, later anglicised by his father), investors began to fret. Eventually, following a cognitive test in which he could not perform basic arithmetic or spelling, he stepped down."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This set the stage for a boardroom battle between the Redstones, now led by Shari, and cbs\u2019s management, principally Leslie Moonves, a former actor who was chairman and chief executive and stood to run both cbs and Viacom should they be combined. Mr Moonves, named the fourth-most-powerful person in entertainment by the Hollywood Reporter, was a hit with investors. Yet after Harvey Weinstein was unmasked as a serial sexual abuser, numerous women accused Mr Moonves of past assaults, which he has always denied."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The mainly elderly, male board of cbs was initially inclined to accept these denials. \u201cWe all did that,\u201d said Arnold Kopelson, a director. Even some of those claiming to help the alleged victims appeared to take advantage of them, such as the agent who used his client\u2019s claims to press Mr Moonves to give parts to other actors on his books. Only investigations by the New Yorker and Vanity Fair (whose journalists were told by CBS\u2019s communications chief to \u201chave some fucking ethics\u201d and \u201cfind a real story\u201d) brought Mr Moonves down."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like a lot of reality tv, \u201cUnscripted\u201d is riveting because its cast is so awful. Shouting matches in Nobu, restraining orders, custody battles (over children and pets), non-disclosure agreements and psychics all feature. One of the few sympathetic characters, Shari Redstone, at least gets a Hollywood ending. After a reconciliation with her father, she sees off Mr Moonves and becomes chairwoman of the newly combined Paramount. The book ends at Sumner Redstone\u2019s funeral, with Shari singing \u201cMy Way\u201d. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 72}
