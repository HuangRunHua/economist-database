It is 1923 and civil war rages on. \u201cOr is it the other way around?\u201d Whoever is executing whom, he is heading over to lend a hand. \u201cFor six bob and a free lunch, I don\u2019t care.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin\u201d (pictured), which is up for nine Academy Awards at the ceremony on March 12th, is ostensibly the story of a ruptured friendship. But it is also a war film\u2014even though the shooting remains out of sight across the water. It shares that theme with most of the Oscars front-runners. War rumbles through the nominations, on the surface or audibly below it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On Inisherin, the row between P\u00e1draic (played by Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson) flares up in a time of war and mimics its rhythms. Life is too short to waste any more of it in nice-but-dull P\u00e1draic\u2019s company, decides Colm, when he could be composing music for his fiddle. P\u00e1draic disagrees about what matters, what lasts and whether the two are the same. Like many a casus belli, theirs seems both foolish and profound. Colm is a grouchy crank\u2014or perhaps has seen life for what it is. And like many conflicts, theirs involves misunderstanding, escalation and self-mutilation: Colm resolves to chop off his fingers if P\u00e1draic insists on speaking to him. Their private war makes them different people."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The sense of queasy intimacy with an enemy suffuses the most powerful scene in \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d (also nominated for nine Oscars). Stuck in a first-world-war shell hole with a French soldier, Paul (Felix Kammerer), the German protagonist, cannot decide whether to kill or embrace him. This is war as an industrial-scale, merciless hell. Surrendering troops are incinerated by flame-throwers, death is agonising and obscene."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first German-made adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque\u2019s novel of 1928, \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d is plainly about war. But it is also about food. The soldiers talk and sing about it. They snatch it from dying comrades and pilfer it from locals. While the sybaritic top brass toss meat to their dogs, or query the freshness of their croissants, ordinary soldiers wolf down the rations in the trenches they storm. Their two primitive imperatives are to survive and to find something to eat, even at their peril."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d (six nominations) has the outline and kit of a war film. At its daredevil climax, Maverick (Tom Cruise), back in his shades, leather jacket and cockpit after 36 years, must blow up a uranium-enrichment plant in a nameless rogue state. But the real clashes here are among the ego-addled American fighter pilots, and, above all, between Maverick\u2019s analogue heroism and the automated march of time. \u201cThe future is coming,\u201d a commander tells him, \u201cand you\u2019re not in it.\u201d He\u2019ll see about that."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Storytelling, it is true, always runs on conflict. Man versus fate, or nature, or society, or another man (or woman): typologies of it abound online and in creative-writing seminars. As Kurt Vonnegut enjoined, \u201cevery character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.\u201d Someone or something gets in the way, and the ensuing friction forges characters, generates tension and drives the plot. Even so, the martial drumbeat of this year\u2019s Oscars seems loud, chiming with the concussions from Ukraine and the bellicose timbre of wider politics."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Take the suite of conflicts in \u201cT\u00e1r\u201d (also six nominations). At first the film seems to be a dispatch from the cultural sort of war, as Lydia T\u00e1r (Cate Blanchett), maestro of the Berlin Philharmonic, riles a class of young musicians with her old-school insistence on separating art from the artist. When a student who identifies \u201cas a BIPOC pangender person\u201d has issues with \u201cwhite, male, cis composers\u201d, she brusquely says people ought not to be \u201cso eager to be offended\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the hot-button spats turn out to be camouflage for the film\u2019s more important war: between T\u00e1r and her past and conscience. A walking, baton-wielding will to power, she tyrannises her underlings, exploits her rights of patronage, cheats on her wife, drives fast and punches hard. Yet she is haunted, and undone, by uncanny motifs and memories\u2014disembodied screams, the image of a maze, a head of red hair."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a sequence that hovers between realism and nightmare, T\u00e1r descends into a basement and is stalked by a spectral dog. Down there, below the surface, an elementary, eternal conflict is fought and often lost: the one against yourself.
