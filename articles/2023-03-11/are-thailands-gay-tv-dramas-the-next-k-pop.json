Visitors, all women, swoon over wall-to-wall pictures of Bright Vachirawit and Win Metawin, stars of \u201c2gether: The Series\u201d, a Thai TV drama about two students who fall in love. The actors, both men, are depicted exchanging flirtatious glances and hugging. Airy Thai pop music plays in the background. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Thailand had such handsome men,\u201d says Kobayashi Maki.

Though the first shows appeared in 2014, the genre, including over a hundred series to date, took off outside Thailand during covid-19 lockdowns, thanks in part to many being available on YouTube. In Japan, a key market, the hashtag Thai numa or \u201cThai swamp\u201d\u2014a reference to the shows\u2019 addictiveness\u2014is popular on social media. Thailand promotes BL content at international trade shows. In June 2021 the industry secured 360m baht ($10.4m) in foreign investment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "BL originated as a Japanese manga storyline, which became popular in the 1990s. It has always been mainly consumed by straight women, just as the Thai televised version is. \u201cI get to see two handsome men together. It\u2019s a feast for my eyes!\u201d says Takabayashi Otoha, a 20-year-old Japanese fan.

A recent survey suggested that more than 20% of the TV shows\u2019 fans in Thailand are gay. That may be in part thanks to a growing number of storylines about the discrimination they face, notwithstanding Bangkok\u2019s reputation as a gay mecca. The shows\u2019 success is itself a rebuke to that chauvinism. \u201cThese days, you see BL couples featured on big advertisements in public.

While embracing the BL shows\u2019 potential to burnish Thailand\u2019s soft power, it tends to play down their gay content when promoting them; it is also opposed to same-sex marriage. Back in 2007 the government briefly banned BL comics under obscenity laws. The production companies will be wary of provoking another backlash. \u201cIf they go too far, they might get crushed,\u201d warns Ms Ishikawa.
