Much of this is because of the jobs they perform, by choice or social expectation; these are often worse-paid than typical male occupations. Some, as when women\u2019s pay is lower for the same position, is the result of discrimination. Before the covid-19 pandemic, the gap between median male and female wages was at least edging down. The Economist\u2019s glass-ceiling index of female workplace empowerment, published each year on March 8th, international women\u2019s day, shows that this salutary trend reversed in 2021 in some of the mostly rich members of the OECD, including Britain and Canada (see chart, and economist.com/glassceiling for the full index)."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230311_WBC286.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 685.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "One explanation is a hangover from the pandemic.

In 2022 the share of board members across the OECD who were women crept over 30% for the first time. MSCI now expects parity by 2038, four years earlier than previous estimates. Only 64 out of 3,000 or so big companies in the research firm\u2019s global stock index had a female-majority board. But that was double the number in 2021 and includes giants like Citigroup and Shell.
