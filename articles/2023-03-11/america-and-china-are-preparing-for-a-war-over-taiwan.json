No big screens for video links of the sort used in Iraq and Afghanistan: to avoid detection, the marines must make sure their communications blend into the background just as surely as their camouflage blends into the tropical greenery.

Its warships and fighter jets routinely cross the \u201cmedian line\u201d (in effect Taiwan\u2019s maritime boundary) and harass military ships and planes of America and its allies.

The pla, with an estimated 2m active personnel, versus Taiwan\u2019s 163,000, would need extensive preparations to conduct what would be the biggest amphibious assault since the D-Day landings in 1944. It would have to cancel leave, gather landing ships, stockpile munitions, set up mobile command posts and much more."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But in a war of choice, with Mr Xi able to pick his timing, many of these moves could be disguised as military exercises.

If Mr Xi cites some \u201cprovocation\u201d, and begins with actions short of war, such as a blockade, America or its allies might equivocate."}, {"role": "body", "text": "America must also weigh how far its preparations risk precipitating conflict. Send aircraft-carriers to the region as a show of force? Deploy troops to Taiwan? Threaten China\u2019s oil supplies through the Strait of Malacca? All might be deemed provocations by China, if not acts of war."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As war approaches, Taiwan will move navy ships from its vulnerable western coast to the east, behind the mountain range that runs along the eastern side of the island.

The marines would deploy around maritime choke-points. American submarines would slip under the waves, some mustering close to Taiwan.

They would probably be overruled by those seeking a diplomatic solution, or at least not wanting to be blamed for firing the first shot."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China, for its part, would have to take a momentous decision. Should it limit its attack to Taiwan, hoping to create a fait accompli as America and its allies dither? Or should it strike America\u2019s forces in the region, in a new Pearl Harbour? The first option leaves America free to attack the invasion fleet; the latter all but guarantees its wholehearted entry into the war, and probably Japan\u2019s, too, if China attacked American bases there."}, {"role": "body", "text": "An invasion would almost certainly begin with massive missile and rocket strikes on Taiwan. These would quickly destroy much of Taiwan\u2019s navy, air force and air defences. Wang Hongguang, a former deputy commander of the pla region opposite Taiwan, predicted in 2018 that there would be 24 hours of bombardment\u2014first on military and political targets, then on civilian infrastructure such as power plants and fuel depots. He suggested that China would blind Taiwan\u2019s satellites, cut its subsea internet cables and use electronic warfare to scramble its command-and-control systems, hobbling co-ordination with American and allied forces."}, {"role": "body", "text": "General Wang said the onslaught would cause enough havoc to open at least a two-day window for invasion. If American forces did not arrive within three days, he blustered, \u201cdon\u2019t bother to make a trip in vain\u201d. China will also do its best to sap Taiwan\u2019s will to fight. Its cyber-forces will try to hack local television and radio, and bombard Taiwanese soldiers with text and social-media messages, offering rewards to mutineers and deserters."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China must then confront the formidable challenge of an amphibious assault, one of the most difficult forms of warfare. The beaches of Kinmen, a Taiwanese island just 3km from the mainland, are dotted with relics from an attempted invasion in 1949, when Nationalist forces killed or captured almost the entire advance party of 9,000 Communist troops who landed in small fishing boats. The pla has come far since then, acquiring advanced weaponry and studying precedents such as D-Day, the American-led landings at Incheon in Korea in 1950 and Britain\u2019s recapture of the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Walk of strife"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the risks are still great. China has not fought a war since invading Vietnam in 1979. Although the Taiwan Strait is only 130km wide at its narrowest, its currents and tides are powerful and erratic.

Just 14 of Taiwan\u2019s beaches are suitable for landings and they are heavily fortified, especially the ones close to Taipei, where Chinese forces would probably prefer to start an invasion (see map 1). Taiwan has built lots of bunkers and tunnels in the area."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/777/90/media-assets/image/20230311_FBM991.png", "imageWidth": 640, "imageHeight": 776}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nor is it certain that the pla has enough ships to transport an adequate landing force quickly across the strait. It would need 300,000 to 1m troops to be sure of subduing Taiwan. It has six amphibious army brigades stationed nearby, with a combined 20,000 troops, plus a similar number of marines. But China\u2019s amphibious landing ships could probably ferry only about 20,000 soldiers across in the first day or two, depending on how much equipment they take. Likewise, the pla\u2019s transport aircraft could probably convey only half of its 20,000 airborne troops in the opening phase. The pla recently practised using ferries and other civilian ships, which could bring across many more units but, for that to work well, China would need to capture a still-usable port."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The war in Ukraine has raised fresh doubts, too, especially about China\u2019s ground forces. Its combined-arms battalions, including its amphibious ones, are modelled on Russia\u2019s battalion tactical groups, which have struggled in Ukraine. Even if China succeeded in swiftly decapitating Taiwan\u2019s leadership, it might still face protracted fighting against forces replicating the Ukrainians\u2019 use of portable missile-launchers and drones."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Taiwan\u2019s strategy, meanwhile, is to thwart China\u2019s initial landing or prevent it from bringing enough troops. Taiwanese forces would block ports and beaches with sea mines, submerged ships and other obstacles. Backed by surviving aircraft and naval vessels, they would strike China\u2019s approaching force with missiles and pound disembarking Chinese troops with artillery and rockets. Some pla texts suggest that Taiwan has underwater pipelines off its beaches that could release flammable liquid. Some of its outlying islands are protected by remote-controlled guns."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If the pla broke out of its beachheads, it would face a slog through arduous terrain to reach Taipei and other urban centres. Then both sides would face a challenge for which neither is fully prepared: urban warfare. Taiwan is reluctant to fight in its cities, fearing high civilian casualties. The pla does train for urban warfare, but had long banked on a quick victory if it reached Taipei. Since the war in Ukraine began, however, both sides have been practising fighting in built-up areas more."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230311_FBP002.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280, "imageHeight": 720, "imageDescription": "No easy way past"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even if a Chinese invasion got bogged down, though, time would not be on Taiwan\u2019s side. \u201cWe can fend them off for one or two weeks but no longer,\u201d says Si-fu Ou of Taiwan\u2019s Institute for National Defence and Security Research, a think-tank.
