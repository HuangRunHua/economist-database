Translating an entire dining style is harder. No matter how tasty the p\u00e2t\u00e9 de campagne, how artfully nicotine-stained the walls and how much \u00c9dith Piaf warbles from the speakers, eating at a bistro in Phoenix will always be different from eating at one in Lyon. The trick, as a new Singapore-style hawker centre in midtown Manhattan shows, is knowing which parts of the experience can be transplanted successfully, and which should be left at home."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Singapore, hawker centres are large, semi-outdoor spaces (they have roofs but no walls). Food stalls line the perimeter while customers stake out seats at tables in the middle. Ubiquitous and cheap, they are integral to eating in Singapore, where your columnist once lived. They let groups of friends with different tastes and dietary requirements eat together. They are unpretentious and fun: vendors banter and flirt with their customers and the open setting encourages relaxed conversation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Urban Hawker in Manhattan hews to the same basic design principles, with vendors along the walls and communal tables in the centre. The hawkers sell similar foods to their Singaporean counterparts, including creditable prata (a folded fried bread of South Indian origin, served with dhal that was sweeter and less spicy than it should have been), greasy and delicious char kway teow (fried flat noodles), and properly chewy if slightly ungenerous satay with lontong (grilled skewered meat with rice cubes). A sublime chicken rice could hold its own with any stall in Singapore, the poached chicken soothingly soft and springy, every grain of rice distinct yet slicked with rich chicken flavour, the sauces\u2014thick soy, fiery chilli and ginger\u2014complementary rather than overpowering."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But unlike Singapore\u2019s hawker centres, Manhattan\u2019s is indoors. It has a cocktail bar, whereas Singapore\u2019s serve nothing stronger than Tiger, the local lager. And the prices are high: New Yorkers will evidently pay around $20 for a plate of chicken rice that would cost a few Singaporean dollars (a couple of American ones). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Singapore, everyone eats at hawker centres because they are everywhere and serve familiar food cheaply. In New York that role mainly falls to halal carts and fast-food chains. Urban Hawker\u2019s target clientele is posher: the sort of people who know what hawker centres are despite living halfway around the world. Dining there is an event rather than a habit. In other words, it sells cachet as well as food, like the many French bistros outside France that serve cuisine grand-m\u00e8re at prices many actual grandmothers cannot afford. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Compare the New World Mall\u2019s food court (in effect, an indoor hawker centre), a 40-minute subway ride away in Queens. It is at least as delicious and a lot cheaper. But it is authentically Asian-American and aimed at locals in New York\u2019s biggest Chinatown; other visitors need to do some translation work. Urban Hawker gives diners a helping hand\u2014and reaches into their wallets with the other one. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
