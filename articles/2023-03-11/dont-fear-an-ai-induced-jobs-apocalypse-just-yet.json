Coming from the self-styled technoking of Tesla, it was not so much a prediction as a promise. Mr Musk\u2019s car company is developing one such artificially intelligent automaton, codenamed Optimus, for use at home and in the factory. His remarks, made during Tesla\u2019s investor day, were accompanied by a video of Optimus walking around apparently unassisted.

Other \u201cgenerative\u201d AIs have been conjuring up similarly human-like texts, images and sounds by analysing reams of data on the internet. Last month the boss of IBM, a computing giant, forecast that AI will do away with much white-collar clerical work. On March 6th Microsoft announced the launch of a suite of AI \u201cco-pilots\u201d for workers in jobs ranging from sales and marketing to supply-chain management.

In early 19th-century Britain, the Luddites burned factory machines. The term \u201cautomation\u201d first rose to prominence as the adoption of wartime innovations in mechanisation sparked a wave of panic over mass joblessness in the 1950s (see chart 1). In 1978 James Callaghan, Britain\u2019s prime minister, greeted the breakthrough technology of his era\u2014the microprocessor\u2014with a government inquiry into its job-killing potential. Ten years ago Carl Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University published a blockbuster paper, since cited over 5,000 times, claiming that 47% of the tasks American workers perform could be automated away \u201cover the next decade or two\u201d. Now even the techno-optimistic Mr Musk wonders what it would mean for robots to outnumber humans: \u201cIt\u2019s not even clear what an economy is at that point.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although Messrs Frey and Osborne still have a few years to be proved right, and Mr Musk can be safely ignored for the time being, the earlier fears about job-killing technology never materialised. On the contrary, labour markets across the rich world are historically tight\u2014and getting structurally tighter as societies age. There are currently two vacancies for every unemployed American, the highest rate on record. America\u2019s manufacturing and hospitality sectors report labour shortages of 500,000 and 800,000 respectively (as measured by the gap between job openings and unemployed workers whose last job was in the sector in question).

Advances in computer vision have made machines much more dexterous, points out Sami Atiya, who runs the robotics business of ABB, a Swiss industrial firm. Lightweight \u201ccollaborative robots\u201d now work side-by-side with human workers rather than being caged off, and autonomous vehicles ferry objects from one place to another in factories and warehouses. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the same time, robot prices have tumbled. The average price of an industrial robot fell from $69,000 in 2005 to $27,000 in 2017, reckons Ark Invest, an asset manager. In December ABB opened a 67,000-square-metre \u201cmega factory\u2018\u2018 in Shanghai where robots make other robots.

Although they are down from the frothy peaks of 2021, when chief executives sought alternatives to human workforces incapacitated by covid-19, robot-makers\u2019 share prices remain a fifth higher than before the pandemic (see chart 3).

According to the IFR, even South Korean firms, by far the world\u2019s keenest robot-adopters, employ ten manufacturing workers for every industrial robot\u2014a long way from Mr Musk\u2019s vision. In America, China, Europe and Japan the figure is 25-40 to one. The $25bn that, according to consultants at BCG, the world spent on industrial robots in 2020 was less than 1% of global capital expenditure (excluding the energy and mining sectors).

And most menial jobs in advanced economies these days are anyway in the services industries, where physical tasks are harder to automate (see chart 4). The human body, with its joints and digits affording 244 planes of motion, is a marvel of versatility. A typical robot has six such \u201cdegrees of freedom\u201d, notes Kim Povlsen, chief executive of Universal Robots, a manufacturer of industrial robot arms.

Rather than shell out on IT consultants to come and untangle the thicket, many firms prefer to outsource the menial office work to low-cost countries like India or the Philippines. IDC, another research firm, puts the market for software that automates unrewarding office tedium at $20bn a year, even less than is being spent on robots of the physical variety."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Automatic for the people"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In time, further innovation is likely to remove some of those obstacles. For physical robots, this is well under way in machine-mad South Korea. Doosan Robotics, one of the country\u2019s biggest robot-makers, has opened up its software to outside developers to create pre-programmed applications for its robots. These are now used for everything from making coffee to laying flooring on construction sites. Robert Chicken uses robotic arms to operate its deep fryers at its fast-food restaurants; to keep upfront investment for franchisees down, the company rents the robots out to them for around $900 a month, substantially less than the cost of a human operator. Naver, a South Korean internet giant, has a unit developing robot vehicles that can navigate busy environments with complicated layouts: an army of such bots already whizzes around delivering lunch boxes and parcels to its workers.

UiPath, a pioneer in automating mindless tasks such as copying and pasting information from one program to another, now offers other tools that extract data from paperwork using image-recognition algorithms or that map business processes by observing what workers do on their computers. Rob Enslin, UiPath\u2019s co-CEO, says the company already serves 10,000 clients. Power Automate, a tool from Microsoft that allows regular desk jockeys with little programming experience to automate tasks, such as expense or travel approvals, now has 7m monthly active users, says Charles Lamanna, who is responsible for many of the software giant\u2019s automation products.

However, as with robots and process automation, bedding in the new technology will not happen overnight. Allen &amp; Overy, a law firm that in February launched a virtual legal assistant with ChatGPT-like powers, requires its lawyers to cross-check everything the bot spits out. CNET, a tech-news site, starting in November quietly published 73 articles written by a bot, first to the consternation and then the delight of journalists, after the articles were found to be riddled with errors.
