It was September 2022, weeks after Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit was followed by belligerent Chinese military exercises around Taiwan. The billionaire founder of UMC, Taiwan\u2019s second-largest chipmaker, announced a $100m donation to Taiwan\u2019s defence.

Taiwanese reporters wondered if he had lost money in China or been paid off by a political party before the local elections. Why would such a successful businessman put money into Taiwan\u2019s defence, when anyone he trained would not even be legally allowed to pick up weapons? Was this all just a propaganda campaign?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Mr Tsao\u2019s view, that is exactly the point. He spoke up after the Pelosi visit not because of China\u2019s military exercises, but because of the media response. Too many commentators criticised the government and the Americans for upsetting China, not China for intimidating Taiwan. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we are victims of domestic abuse, but when police come to check on us, we say: \u2018Don\u2019t let them come or we\u2019ll be abused more.\u2019 So cowardly!\u201d says Mr Tsao. This comes after decades of Chinese propaganda telling the Taiwanese they will be safe from war so long as they don\u2019t annoy China. That is dangerously naive, says Mr Tsao, who witnessed China\u2019s crackdown on Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests in 2020."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Red menace"}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s Communist Party has been running psychological operations against Taiwan for decades. It tries to affect Taiwanese thinking in two ways: by cultivating businessmen and politicians to support unification, and by sowing defeatism.

Chinese disinformation exploits a media scene that is already rife with rumour-mongering."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Hong Kong\u2019s protests broke out in 2019, Chinese-run social media carried disinformation about protesters taking American money and being controlled by the CIA.

Taiwan\u2019s media regulators fined Want Want\u2019s TV channels several times for failure to check facts, and terminated one channel\u2019s broadcast licence in 2020.

Taiwanese respondents were more confident (43%) of Japanese assistance in a war than of American help.

In the 2000s, when cross-strait relations were close and China more open, Chinese activists often came to Taiwan to learn how it moved away from one-party authoritarianism. \u201cThey thought, and so did we, that Taiwan could show the way forward for China,\u201d says Mr Lee.
