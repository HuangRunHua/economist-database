Taiwan produces over 60% of the world\u2019s semiconductors and over 90% of the most advanced ones. Most are manufactured by a single company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). Until now, the most advanced have been made only in Taiwan."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The semiconductor industry is called Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d, giving the world a big reason to defend the island. Yet chips are the industry most affected by the split between America and China. Parts of the shield are now moving abroad. In December TSMC held a ceremony to mark the start of a chip plant (or \u201cfab\u201d) in Arizona. Joe Biden was there, as were Tim Cook from Apple and TSMC\u2019s founder, Morris Chang. Mr Chang said TSMC would triple its investment in Arizona to $40bn, open a second fab in 2026 and make three-nanometre chips, now the most advanced, in America. Mr Biden declared that \u201cAmerican manufacturing is back, folks.\u201d Mr Chang more morosely called globalisation and free trade \u201calmost dead\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The chip industry was built on globalisation, with every part of the supply chain supporting it. TSMC\u2019s fabs, based on efficiency and high-skilled, long-hour labour, could make chips faster and more accurately than any rival. Experts agree that replicating this supply chain elsewhere would be inefficient. Mr Chang told reporters in November that the cost of making chips in America would be 55% higher. He reportedly told Nancy Pelosi that American efforts to bring the business home were \u201cdoomed to fail\u201d. Yet the shift to local supply chains is happening, boosted by covid-19 and the war in Ukraine. Governments want critical tech made in safer places, closer to home. And America and China are competing to control the most sophisticated chips that may prove crucial to the next generation of advanced weapons. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Taiwan is pulled between the two. China has poured $50bn into chipmaking, hoping to meet 70% of domestic demand for chips by 2025. It has also poached Taiwan\u2019s chip engineers, executives and trade secrets. That brain drain has alarmed Taiwan\u2019s government, which has raided Chinese chipmakers and passed new laws against economic espionage. America is also trying to stop China getting advanced chips. It passed the CHIPS and Science Act in August 2022, offering $39bn in subsidies and a 25% tax credit to promote manufacturing at home, as well as $13bn of investment in chip research. In October 2022 it banned the export of advanced chips and chipmaking gear to China.

Officials say such fears are overblown. TSMC aims to produce 600,000 wafers a year at its American fabs. But its manufacturing capacity is more than 13m wafers a year.

Foreign chipmakers are investing in Taiwan. ASML, a Dutch company that makes advanced lithography machines for cutting-edge chips, is opening its sixth factory in Taipei in 2023.
