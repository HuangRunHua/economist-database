Just three days into his presidency, Mr Trump moved to kill it\u2014and succeeded only in denying America its benefits. While America ditched the pact, others defied expectations by staying wedded to it and the principles of free trade and multilateral rule-making it represented. Five years ago this week, ministers from the 11 remaining countries met in Chile to sign the renamed Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for TransPacific Partnership (CPTPP)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "How has it fared?

In some industries import values within the bloc rose by as much as 22.9% and export values by as much as 11.6% for every percentage-point drop in tariffs, reckons the Asia Competitiveness Institute, a research centre in Singapore.

Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand have all expressed interest in joining. The pact may soon have its first new member: Britain is expected to reach an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d to join as early as this week. That will put the spotlight on applications from China and Taiwan, which were submitted in late 2021. The group\u2019s handling of those duelling bids will have big implications for the balance of power in Asia, as well as the future of what\u2019s left of the liberal international trading system. \u201cJust as the mettle of the TPP project has been tested by the United States, now it will be tested by China,\u201d says Mireya Sol\u00eds of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank in Washington. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The CPTPP originated in the halcyon days of the 1990s, when great-power competition was over, America was ascendant and globalisation in vogue. The leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation, or APEC, grouping gathered at a resort in Bogor, Indonesia in 1994, and, clad in intricately patterned Javanese shirts, pledged to pursue \u201cfree and open trade and investment\u201d in the region by 2020. A big step towards that vision came in 2005 when an agreement between four small economies\u2014Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore\u2014caught America\u2019s eye. Australia, Peru and Vietnam joined the talks that ensued, followed by Canada, Malaysia, Mexico and, in 2013, Japan. The monster free-trade pact taking shape became the economic centrepiece of Barack Obama\u2019s much-touted \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia. Encompassing some 40% of global GDP, the TPP was sold in America as offering open markets and enforcing high standards to counter China\u2019s growing unruliness."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If its economic punch has been subdued, the CPTPP has had much more impact on global trade rules. Its provisions on digital governance, customs procedures and intellectual-property protection have become reference points for deals elsewhere. \u201cThese rules are living beyond the corners of CPTPP,\u201d says Wendy Cutler, a former American official who negotiated the TPP. America\u2019s revised free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), lifted sections on digital commerce from the CPTPP. This influence is invaluable at a time when the \u201cmultilateral system as a whole, the World Trade Organisation at its core, are under threat like never before,\u201d argues Shiro Armstrong of the Australian National University in Canberra.

For the British government, too, the political pull is stronger than the economic one. Joining would, it is estimated, boost the baseline level of British gdp by \u00a31.8bn or 0.08%. But MPs in the ruling Conservative Party love trade deals and are desperate to secure visible benefits from leaving the EU and to ensure that Britain has a degree of influence in the Indo-Pacific. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Equally important, the British precedent should help set high standards for the CPTPP itself. Britain\u2019s strict accession process, which admitted no exception to the club\u2019s rules, was intended to establish a \u201cUK model\u201d for future applicants, says Munakata Naoko, a former Japanese trade negotiator. China will try to put that to the test. Its government has in recent months been emphasising its intention to join the CPTPP; China\u2019s departing prime minister, Li Keqiang, called for \u201cactive steps\u201d towards accession during a speech before the National People\u2019s Congress on March 5th. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is a lot of scepticism about China\u2019s application. China and many existing CPTPP members already belong to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a lower-standard Asian mega-trade deal signed in 2020. China would have to undertake major economic reforms to join the CPTPP on its current terms. The country lags far behind many of the CPTPP\u2019s standards on treatment of state-owned enterprises, intellectual property, labour rights and digital trade. The \u201cheavy hand of state interference\u201d in recent years has \u201cmoved them farther from the starting line\u201d, says Jeffrey Schott of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an American think-tank. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet many policymakers and trade experts in Asia treat the possibility of Chinese membership more seriously than those outside the region. Officials in the Chinese Ministry of Commerce are in earnest about it, they say, even if the process of negotiation is likely to be protracted. China may try to secure carve-outs from the club\u2019s rules. Meanwhile, the possibility of Chinese membership will exert a strong pull for many in the region and beyond. Research by Peter Petri of Brandeis International Business School and Michael Plummer of Johns Hopkins University finds that if China joined CPTPP, global annual income gains due to the pact would quadruple to $632bn, or a quarter more than under the original TPP with America involved.

Any decision on new members must be unanimous. \u201cChina is trying a divide and conquer strategy, obviously,\u201d Ms Munakata says. Among and within CPTPP member countries, there are different schools of thought on how to proceed. Some argue it is better to let China have a hearing, and, ultimately, join if it meets the standards. \u201cIt\u2019s in Singapore\u2019s interests to have China in the TPP\u2014it creates a more stable and predictable environment for trade in goods and services, particularly in intellectual property,\u201d says George Yeo, a former Singaporean trade minister.
