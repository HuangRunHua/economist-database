Options are contracts that provide the right to buy or sell a security at a specified price over a fixed time period.

Sophisticated buyers use options to hedge against risk, generate income or as a form of leverage. However, options can also be used to gamble."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Interest in American options has grown rapidly since the covid-19 pandemic began.

Retail traders, though, seem to be using options mainly to speculate: in 2020-21 they bought twice as many calls (bets that a price will rise) as puts. And such investors, whose share of overall stock trading in America has doubled since 2019, now account for 48% of trading volume in options, according to a forthcoming paper in the Journal of Finance by Svetlana Bryzgalova, Anna Pavlova and Taisiya Sikorskaya of London Business School."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Moreover, rather than trading options that last for weeks, months or years, buyers are now piling into zero-days-to-expiration (0dte) contracts. These options, which expire the day that they are bought and yield windfalls if a price moves sharply that day, became more widely available in 2022, after exchanges increased the number of trading days on which they are available. As meme-stock mania has faded, 0dte options, mainly written on market-wide indices, have become the new fad. Daily trading of 0dte contracts recently reached a record notional value of $1trn.
