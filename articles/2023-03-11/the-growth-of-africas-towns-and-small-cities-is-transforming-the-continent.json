Call it the rise of small-town Africa. As villages expand, usually because of rural population growth, they turn into towns. The total number of towns and cities in Africa more than doubled from 3,319 in 1990 to 7,721 in 2015, according to Africapolis.

But the rise of Africa\u2019s small towns is a reminder that African urbanisation is often subtly different. In Africa, rural-urban migration is important.

The largest cluster in sub-Saharan Africa encompasses the Nigerian cities of Lagos and Ibadan, as well as Cotonou, the commercial capital of neighbouring Benin\u2014and dozens of other small towns and cities.

Wages in cities are about twice as high as they are in the countryside, reckons the OECD. And urbanites work 30% more hours per week than their country cousins. Small towns offer inhabitants some of the biggest potential gains. For a range of outcomes measured by the OECD, the benefits of moving from a village to an area of 50,000 people are more than those from going from a town of that size to a city of at least 1m. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And Africans need not even live in a city to enjoy the benefits of one. Today some 50% of rural Africans live within 14km of a city. This proximity means they can more easily gain access to the public and private services that cities offer. For instance, rural households living within 5km of a city are twice as likely to have a bank account as those 30km away. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The rise of small towns is blurring the distinction between rural and urban Africa. It is generally cheaper to live in small towns than large cities, which allows families to rent a house in town while still being able to afford to keep a home in the countryside, where they can grow food. This is a form of insurance that reduces the risks of moving. Now that urban areas are closer by, with cheaper transport options (such as imported Chinese and Indian motor-cycles), more Africans can commute from villages, too. The daytime population of Kisumu is around 800,000; at night, that shrinks to 500,000, notes Peter Anyang\u2019 Nyong\u2019o, its governor."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Urbanisation is good for Africa\u2014but it could be so much better. Economists talk a great deal about the magic of agglomeration: how, as cities get bigger, the economies of scale and the spillover effects can lead to higher productivity. Yet, as the World Bank puts it, African cities are \u201ctoo crowded, too disconnected and too costly\u201d to make the most of this magic. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "In a tired old street"}, {"role": "body", "text": "About half of urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa live in slums. These settlements are often dense patches in otherwise sprawling cities. Whereas many cities in other parts of the world grow upwards, becoming denser over time, African ones tend to grow outwards. That is a problem because it is generally cheaper to provide water, power, transport and other infrastructure to compact cities than to sprawling ones. Denser cities and those with good transport links let more workers reach potential jobs, making labour markets more efficient by allowing better matching of skills and opportunities. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A World Bank report published in 2017 analysed the growth of 21 African cities in the first decade of the century. It found that between 46% and 77% of their growth came from expansion, rather than infilling existing areas. A related problem is \u201cleapfrogging\u201d, whereby patches of land are left undeveloped and construction happens farther out. Another study, from 2016, looked at 265 cities in 70 countries and found that, after controlling for population size and GDP per person, African cities were more fragmented and their residents less likely to interact with each other. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The inefficiency of African cities compounds another problem: they are expensive. The World Bank reckons that living costs (food, housing, transport and so on) are about a fifth to a third higher in African cities than those in other developing countries. So long as firms must pay steep wages to cover steep living costs, that can make them less internationally competitive. In other parts of the world manufacturing has tended to rise sharply as a share of GDP as the rate of urbanisation approached 60%; in Africa it has broadly remained flat. The dominant \u201cindustries\u201d in African cities are typically those that involve \u201cnon-tradable\u201d services or construction, rather than export-oriented sectors. In Kisumu, Mr Nyong\u2019o worries about the lack of formal jobs for young Kenyans. He says that many youngsters end up working informally. \u201cThey are moving to cities for jobs that don\u2019t exist,\u201d he says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are many reasons for Africa\u2019s suboptimal urbanisation that have little to do with cities themselves. A low adult literacy rate impedes the transition to a more productive, industrialised economy. Low agricultural productivity keeps food prices in the cities high, which makes it harder for economies to shift from growing things to making them. The \u201cresource curse\u201d distorts both politics and economies. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But some of the reasons relate directly to urban policy. Planning regulations, especially in former British territories, are outdated (the French were keener to impose compact cities). The minimum plot size in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\u2019s commercial capital, is more than ten times that in Philadelphia, making it harder to get a cheap proper house. Restrictive zoning helps push people into informal areas on the outskirts. Few city governments tax land, leaving them short of revenue and with no way of benefiting from increased land values when they invest in infrastructure. Property taxes are just 0.5% of GDP in sub-Saharan Africa, versus 2% for OECD countries. Many countries have not updated property rolls for several decades. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In addition, the boundaries of local governments rarely match those of contemporary cities, making it hard for officials to plan. Accra, Ghana\u2019s capital, is spread across 30 districts. Far less spending is devolved to local governments in Africa than elsewhere. They are responsible for an average of 11% of investment by African governments. That is about half the global average and is lower than in other developing countries. Local bureaucrats toil in tough conditions. Just 6% of Nigerian local government employees have access to a computer."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the main factor distorting African cities is that land and property markets are broken. The nub of this problem is a lack of clear property rights. Instead there is a patchwork of overlapping forms of land ownership\u2014modern title deeds, traditional communal land, and informal \u201cgrey\u201d claims. In Durban, South Africa\u2019s third-largest city, more than a third of land is jointly administered by a trust overseen by the Zulu royal family. In Ghana\u2019s Ashanti region the king operates a land registry parallel to the official registry office. In Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, where there are at least four different types of property rights, the productivity of a given area is linked to its type of tenure. As cities expand into rural areas, all of this becomes more complicated. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many African countries have tried reforms. Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, an autonomous territory that wants to become an independent country, has a sophisticated property tax that allows the region to make up for a lack of funding from Mogadishu, Somalia\u2019s capital. Botswana regularised customary land rights in 2008. In 2019 Togo redrew the boundaries of Lom\u00e9, the capital, to recognise its expansion and that of satellite towns. Ghana, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal and Uganda all have dedicated plans to develop second cities. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet not all are thought through. African politicians sometimes prefer to build flashy new\u2014sometimes \u201csmart\u201d\u2014cities, rather than fix old ones. Many projects do not survive a change of leader.
