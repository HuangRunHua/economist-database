Since the heady post-lockdown days of 2021 gdp growth across the 38 countries of the oecd has slowed almost to a standstill, and in some countries is negative. Business confidence is below its long-run average. Yet there is not much sign of weakness in the labour market. On March 7th Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, observed that in America, \u201cdespite the slowdown in growth, the labour market remains extremely tight.\u201d Across the oecd as a whole the unemployment rate was 4.9% in December\u2014the lowest in many decades. From the third to the fourth quarter of the year, the rich world added about 1m jobs, in line with the long-run average. In half of oecd countries, including Canada, France and Germany, there has never been a higher share of working-age folk in a job. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Joblessness is rising in a few countries, including Austria and Israel. One of the worst performers is Finland, where the unemployment rate has risen by a percentage point from its post-lockdown low. In the face of soaring energy prices and reduced trade with Russia, the country\u2019s gdp fell by 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022. But \u201cworst\u201d is relative. At 7.1% in January, Finland\u2019s jobless rate is still well below its long-run average. Meanwhile, most of the places synonymous with the sky-high joblessness of the early 2010s\u2014Greece, Italy, Spain\u2014are doing much better now. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This employment miracle hints at a change in Western economies. To understand why, return to Japan. Local employers dislike firing workers, even if they have little for them to do. In part because more and more people are retiring, firms struggle for new staff and are reluctant to let people go unless they have no choice. The result is an unemployment rate which barely rises, even in recessions. In the past 30 years Japan\u2019s jobless rate has varied by just 3.5 percentage points, compared with 9.5 points in the average rich country. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A more Japanese labour market would have disadvantages. If workers do not leave poorly performing firms, they cannot join innovative ones which drive growth. Indeed, the data suggest that rich-world productivity growth is exceptionally weak at present. However, spells of unemployment can exert a terrible human toll. Countries where unemployment is less volatile also tend to have milder recessions, points out Dario Perkins of ts Lombard, a financial-services firm. When the labour market does not crack, people can keep spending even as growth slows.

Perhaps, after the pandemic, bosses are kinder to workers. Another, more realistic, possibility is that firms are in a strong financial position. This may allow them to withstand lower revenues today without needing to slash costs. Many received help from governments during the covid era. And in recent years corporate profits have been hefty. Businesses across the rich world are still sitting on cash piles about a third higher than before the pandemic."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A more intriguing possibility concerns the workforce. According to our estimates, the rich world is \u201cmissing\u201d 10m workers, or roughly 1.5% of the labour force, relative to pre-pandemic trends. In Britain and Italy the workforce has actually shrunk. Early retirements and an ageing population explain part of the deficit. Covid may have pushed people to reassess their priorities, prompting them to drop out. Some even think long covid is forcing people to stay on the sidelines. Whatever the explanation, falling participation has wreaked havoc with plans. Many firms fired staff when the pandemic hit, only to struggle to rehire them in 2021. That year vacancies in the oecd hit an all-time high of 30m."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230311_FNC215.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Employers may now want to avoid making the same mistake.
