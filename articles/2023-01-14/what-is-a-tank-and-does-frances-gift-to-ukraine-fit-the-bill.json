On January 4th he said that he had agreed to supply Ukraine with the AMX-10RC, which he described as a \u201clight battle tank\u201d. Among military geeks, that sparked a furious debate: does the AMX-10RC meet the definition? And what is a tank, anyway?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the face of it, the answer is obvious. Like Justice Potter Stewart\u2019s memorable definition of obscenity, you know a tank when you see it: a big armoured thing with a big gun. Yet this heuristic quickly leads you astray. Take Germany\u2019s Panzerhaubitze 2000, supplied to Ukraine in 2022. It has armour, tracks and a suitably menacing gun protruding from the front. But it is not a tank. It is a howitzer; the long barrel is in fact an artillery tube, designed to fire shells high into the air and tens of kilometres away\u2014much farther than any tank. It looks like a tank, but it does not quack like a tank."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So does the AMX-10RC count? The French vehicle is an \u201coddity\u201d, says Olivier Schmitt of the Centre for War Studies at the University of Southern Denmark. In the first world war, tanks evolved to break through the front lines across rough terrain into the enemy rear with firepower and good protection. The AMX-10RC was originally designed for reconnaissance\u2014scouting ahead of the main force\u2014and is therefore light and quick, rather than beefy. It was a key part of France\u2019s rapid action force, says Mr Schmitt, a group of five divisions created in the 1980s to dash 1,000km east through Germany to engage the first echelon of an invading Soviet army within 48 hours."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Its own armour is relatively light, and would not survive a hit from most modern tanks. Its gun was designed to take out Soviet tanks of the era\u2014which is why it was called a tank \u201chunter\u201d\u2014and performed well against Iraq\u2019s Soviet-made tanks in the Gulf war of 1991. But it could struggle to penetrate the newest Russian armour. Most controversially of all, the AMX-10RC has wheels rather than tracks. These allow it to move faster and more quietly than a traditional tank\u2014but mean it would struggle on boggy ground and tougher terrain. For these reasons, NATO, and most purists, would consider the AMX-10RC to fall below the threshold of tank-dom. The truth is that the boundary is blurry."}, {"role": "body", "text": "During the cold war, light tanks such as this were common. But in modern armies, the balance between mobility on the one hand, and protection and firepower on the other, has shifted. Light tanks have been squeezed out at the lower end by infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) like the Russian BMP-3 or American Bradley and at the upper end by main battle tanks (MBTs). The MBT\u2014like America\u2019s Abrams and Germany\u2019s Leopard\u2014is now the quintessential tank: very big, heavy, strong and well-armed, though correspondingly expensive and harder to maintain and operate. (Read our interactive on the future of the tank)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ultimately the debate is somewhat philosophical. Ukraine is desperate for armoured vehicles of any sort so it can mount more counter-offensives. Ukraine has long sought Germany\u2019s Leopard tanks, which are considered among the best MBTs in the world. They are used by 13 European armies, which have more than 2,000 of them in total, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Germany\u2019s government has resisted in part because, as Emily Haber, Germany\u2019s ambassador in Washington observed in September, \u201cno other nation has so far provided Ukraine with Western-made battle tanks\u201d. Mr Macron\u2019s decision to call the AMX-10RC a light tank is thought to have been intended as a spur to Olaf Scholz, his German counterpart."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If so, it worked\u2014in part. On January 5th Germany said it would send the Marder, an IFV which is less capable than the Leopard but has been the workhorse of the Bundeswehr since the 1970s. At the same time, America confirmed that it would send its own Bradley IFVs, which have highly advanced sights, fire control systems and guns. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The French announcement also underscores how far Western red lines, including Mr Macron\u2019s, have shifted since last spring: from warning against offensive weaponry to providing a capability that will aid Ukrainian counter-offensives. \u201cThere is something touching to see the VABs [French armoured vehicles supplied earlier] and the AMX-10 do in 2022 what they had been designed for,\u201d reflects Mr Schmitt: \u201cFighting the Russians.\u201d \u25a0"}]}
