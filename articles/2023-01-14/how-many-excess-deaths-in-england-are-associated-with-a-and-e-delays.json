Almost everything else is debated, including the question of how many patients are dying as a result of the chaos in hospitals. The proportion of patients who wait more than 12 hours in accident-and-emergency (A&amp;E) departments to be admitted to a ward has risen from 2% to 7% over the past year. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), a doctors\u2019 association, has estimated that delays in A&amp;E are leading to 300-500 additional deaths per week. Officials at NHS England do not accept this figure.

Excess mortality in England and Wales\u2014a measure of deaths from all causes compared with a baseline period\u2014in the four weeks to December 30th was 17% higher than the average of this period in 2016-19. That is an extra 1,700 deaths per week (see chart). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The primary basis for the RCEM\u2019s claim is a paper published in the Emergency Medicine Journal in early 2022. Its authors used NHS data from 2016 to 2018 to estimate an individual\u2019s risk of death after arriving in A&amp;E. They found that a wait of six to eight hours, rather than the target of less than four hours, for a patient to be transferred from A&amp;E to a ward increased their risk of death by 1.7 percentage points, other things being equal. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The RCEM admits that its own estimates are rough. To verify them, The Economist has built a model using hospital-level data on patient deaths and A&amp;E waiting times for 121 individual NHS trusts in England on a rolling 12-monthly basis between March 2016 and July 2022. We, too, find that delays in A&amp;E\u2014from time spent waiting for initial treatment to the decision to admit\u2014are associated with higher mortality after controlling for other things. A ten-percentage-point increase in the proportion of A&amp;E patients waiting between four and 12 hours for admission to a ward, for example, is associated with an additional 1.2 deaths per 1,000 patients arriving at hospital. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "NHS death data since July 2022 are not yet published, but data on waiting times are available up to November. Our model suggests that an additional 3,400 A&amp;E-associated deaths occurred between August and November 2022 compared with a scenario in which waiting times remained at 2019 levels. At around 260 per week, that number is below the ballpark figure from the RCEM, but would still account for one-quarter of the excess deaths in England over that period. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are caveats. The model uses hospital-level mortality data, not data for emergency admissions specifically. Other factors could be having an effect, from ambulance waiting times to problems seeing GPs: our estimate is not a ceiling on the number of excess deaths that can be associated with the NHS. The prevalence of covid-19 and flu is beyond its control. But that more people are dying\u2014and dying in large numbers\u2014because of delays in A&amp;E is clear enough. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
