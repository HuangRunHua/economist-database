Royal correspondents used to subsisting on crumbs\u2014an innuendo buried in six hours of anodyne Netflix nonsense here, a plucky first day of school for Prince George there\u2014suddenly found themselves glutted by revelations on everything from how many Taliban (25) he killed in Afghanistan to his \u201cnether regions\u201d. Best of all, these came not from press skulduggery but were offered up voluntarily by Harry for cash. The press had an embarrassment of riches; Harry had the riches of embarrassment.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For effect."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is, in short, a romp. And obviously the access is excellent. Alan Bennett once wrote a novella about the queen in which he imagined the humdrum side of royal life, and this book does Bennettian humdrum better than Bennett himself. You learn that footmen served the young princes their tv dinners under silver domes, like kings in a cartoon; that his granny made a mean salad dressing; that King Charles III does headstands against a door in his boxers to help his back. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is all very engaging. But it also feels somehow iffy. \u201cAutobiography\u201d, George Orwell once wrote, \u201cis only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful\u2026since any life when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.\u201d This book manages to feel both like a series of defeats and somewhat untrustworthy at the same time. Things are rarely just Harry\u2019s fault. A decision to go to a fancy-dress party as a Nazi is explained away by saying that he was merely following the orders of Herr und Frau Obergruppenf\u00fchrer William and Kate. They look the sort. Camilla is a scheming villain; Charles is a duffer; an editor is a \u201cpustule\u201d. Only Meghan\u2014\u201cshe\u2019s perfect, she\u2019s perfect\u201d\u2014is exempt. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For all the romps, and the rumps, this book feels less like a lark than a terrible miscalculation. Harry presents himself as a creature in a gilded cage. Perhaps he hoped that, by writing a memoir, he\u2019d set himself free. The cage isn\u2019t fashioned by the royals, however, but by the eyes of the audience upon them. By revealing so much, all he has done is draw the bars in closer. The Firm would have stopped him from producing a book like this. And that would have been a service. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter. "}]}
