The night before, in front of crowds of space enthusiasts braving the weather, a converted jumbo jet had taken off from Newquay Airport in Cornwall, in south-west England, to perform the first-ever space launch from British soil.

But about half an hour later, Virgin Orbit released a terse statement talking of an \u201canomaly\u201d. The firm later admitted that, although the rocket had technically reached space, it had not made it into orbit\u2014and neither had any of the nine satellites it had been carrying."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is not yet clear exactly what went wrong (other Virgin Orbit rockets have made it into orbit in the past). But the failure comes at an awkward time for the company, which hopes to carve out a niche offering cheap, small-scale launch services to the rapidly growing space industry. That market is highly contested, and Virgin Orbit\u2019s prospects looked shaky even before the launch. (After, its share price, already down by 75% over the course of 2022, fell by 12%.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is also a bit of a setback for Britain\u2019s broader ambitions in the space business. The country has plans for seven \u201cspaceports\u201d (this year may also see launches, by different firms, from Sutherland and the Shetland Islands). Britain\u2019s high latitude, a drawback for some orbits, gives easier access to others; its proximity to the Atlantic means rockets can be aimed away from populated areas. Still, launching rockets, despite the glamour, is not where most of the value lies. BryceTech, a consultancy, put the value of the space business at \u00a3270bn in 2019\u2014but the value of launch services at just $7bn. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
