Dozens of pastel-coloured houses rise from the shores of its main bay. Locals exchange greetings with tourists and daytrippers arriving by ferry from Turkey. A large sea turtle pokes its head out of the turquoise waters nearby."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But not all is well. A Greek warship, the HS Daniolos, patrols the waters around the island. A couple of army trucks watch over the harbour. A few troops trickle out of a cruise ship, which has come from Athens. Kastellorizo has recently taken centre stage in a dispute between Greece, to which the island belongs, and Turkey. Greece says Kastellorizo enjoys a continental shelf area, or Exclusive Economic Zone, of 200 nautical miles, in line with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Turkey says Kastellorizo is too small and far from the Greek mainland to be entitled to an EEZ. The Greek claim locks Turkey out of the Mediterranean, Turkey complains.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Turkey accuses the Greeks of militarising the islands, contrary to international treaties. Last year, Turkish media outlets published images, captured by drones, showing deliveries of armoured vehicles to some of the islands. Greece does not deny sending new troops, but says it is doing so only for defensive purposes. With elections scheduled in both Greece and Turkey this year, nationalists on both sides may be tempted to rattle their sabres. The locals on Kastellorizo, as well as the visiting Turks, are trying to tune out the noise. \u201cIt\u2019s only theatre,\u201d says a waiter. NATO leaders should hope he is right. "}]}
