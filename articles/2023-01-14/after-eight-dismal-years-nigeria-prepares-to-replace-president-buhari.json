A former general (and military ruler in the 1980s), he likes to give orders. But markets tend not to obey them. After oil prices plunged in 2014-15 he should have let the currency weaken. Instead he tried to prop it up by banning many imports, from toothpicks to sardines. Investors fled; factories closed. In 2019 he closed Nigeria\u2019s land borders to imported goods, hoping to stimulate local production. Instead, he spurred inflation. Those bits of the economy that have flourished\u2014information technology, music and film-making, all relying on Nigerian talent\u2014have done so mainly by staying away from the state.
