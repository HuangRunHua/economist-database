One feature of Mr DeSantis\u2019s approach is that, as part of his attack on mainstream scientists, he presents himself as a guardian of true science. His vaccine announcement was made at a 90-minute nerdy roundtable with selected scientists discussing several studies. It was hard to imagine Donald Trump sitting through it. But Mr DeSantis listened attentively, telling his audience: \u201cI think people want the truth and I think people want accountability, so you need to have a thorough investigation into what\u2019s happened with these shots.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "That last criticism is not without grounds.

In a televised debate Kamala Harris, now the vice-president, said that she would be vaccinated if public-health professionals recommended it, \u201cbut if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I\u2019m not taking it.\u201d Efforts to stifle dissenting views on topics such as mask efficacy and school closures did not help.

Some Democrats have misrepresented the medical consensus on how best to help children with gender-related distress, presenting this as a closed matter when there is no global scientific consensus.

By going through his state\u2019s board of medicine, Mr DeSantis not only ensures that the ban is more likely to get through but will also enable him to claim it is based in science. \u201cFlorida appears to be the focus group for now,\u201d warns Brandon Wolf from Equality Florida, an LGBTQ+ rights group, \u201cIf successful, I can guarantee you will see other states replicate it.\u201d"}, {"role": "second", "text": "Science the following"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Political opportunism, with both parties loving science where it suits them and spitting it out where it does not, is nothing new to James Cantor, a sex researcher who has seen \u201cfair-weather friends\u201d come and go.
