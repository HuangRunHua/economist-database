In a desperate bid to bring him home, his grandfather emails him with a long-kept secret: he too once fell under the sway of violent Islamists.

Two years before DeMille\u2019s arrival, Gamal Abdel Nasser and his revolutionary Free Officers had deposed the British-backed monarch, ending centuries of foreign rule. Then, in 1954, Nasser ousted the new republic\u2019s president, whom he accused of cosying up to the Muslim Brotherhood, a popular Islamist group. In the novel, Ali is pulled between the bright lights of Hollywood and the austere but noble-sounding Brothers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The real Nasser was a fan of DeMille. He reportedly watched \u201cThe Crusades\u201d, another of the director\u2019s pictures, more than 20 times and was nicknamed \u201cHenry Wilcoxon\u201d, after the British actor who played Richard I. In the book, Nasser is as much a \u201cmatin\u00e9e idol as Emad Hamdy [an Egyptian actor] or Clark Gable\u201d, and his stardom is a political tool. In an episode adapted from history, he dodges eight bullets while giving a speech in Alexandria, dusts himself off and implores his followers to persevere.
