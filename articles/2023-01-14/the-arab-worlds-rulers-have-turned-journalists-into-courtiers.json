Not in Algeria. Only a handful of reporters attended a press conference on January 7th called by the lawyers of Ihsane el-Kadi, a journalist, after he was arrested and the radio station and website he owned were closed. Goons confiscated his journalists\u2019 mobile phones and computers. \u201cPeople are too shocked and scared by the arrest to publish it,\u201d says Tin Hinane, his daughter, a respected Algerian analyst. \u201cAlgeria\u2019s media have all been co-opted by the state or forced to shut down.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This was not always so. For decades Arab rulers put up with an independent press of sorts. Some saw it as a safety-valve and a way to gauge public opinion. They kept a tight grip on journalists but did not dictate coverage. \u201cWe wrote about corrupt arms deals, local support for jihadists and the suppression of women\u2019s rights,\u201d recalls a nostalgic Saudi journalist of the 1990s. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "No longer. Eight of the 15 worst abusers of press freedom are in the Middle East, says Reporters Without Borders, an international watchdog, up from five 20 years ago. The despots who swept back the Arab spring of 2011 have reduced journalists to mere mouthpieces. In 2019 most of Egypt\u2019s main newspapers printed the same 42-line obituary for Muhammad al-Morsi, its deposed president. \u201cAn intelligence officer oversees your work, so you just have to adjust and write about the leader\u2019s great projects\u2014his bridges and roads,\u201d laments a seasoned Egyptian journalist."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Increasingly for Arab regimes, the only permissible news is good news. Last summer the United Arab Emirates (UAE) closed a local newspaper, Al Roeya, and sacked its editor and dozens of journalists, after it reported on cheaper petrol prices in Oman. \u201cIf you are working in a government institution you have to toe the institution\u2019s line,\u201d explained an official. Regimes also buy up advertising agencies so that wayward newspapers can instantly be deprived of revenue. As funds dry up, governments or their friends snap up independent outlets\u2014or let them fold.

Journalists can be hounded with software such as Pegasus, an Israeli-made system which snoops on smartphones. Many are simply being locked up. Egypt is the world\u2019s third-largest jailer of journalists. The killing in 2018 of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, scared many into silence, reckons the Committee to Protect Journalists, an NGO in New York.

But it is too broke to invest in big outlets."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Foreign broadcasters used to offer an alternative. When Egypt announced during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war that Israeli warplanes were falling from the sky like flies, the BBC reported that Israel\u2019s forces were advancing on all fronts. But in September the BBC said it was ending 84 years of transmission by its Arabic radio service and cutting many of its staff. \u201cThe BBC is being neutered,\u201d says Hugh Miles, author of a book on Arab media. \u201cIt\u2019s become very frightened of tackling Gulf regimes.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other Western-owned outlets, such as Bloomberg and Sky News, are arranging partnerships with Gulf regimes; these may limit their reporting.

After civil war swept Lebanon in the 1970s, London became the Arab world\u2019s media capital. But there are signs that Arab governments may be hauling their London-based media home, the better to control them. Al Arab, a newspaper, and Al Ghad, a satellite TV channel, both Emirati-financed, have recently retreated from London. In August Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, a Qatari-owned satellite channel, moved its headquarters from London to Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. \u201cHires in most of the Arab world would have to do what you tell them to,\u201d says Abdulrahman ElShayyal, until recently the channel\u2019s boss. \u201cEditors behave like government ministers.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Under greater surveillance, standards slip. Demoralised editors copy and paste press releases as news. TV presenters are so nervous of departing from the official text messages received during broadcasts that they sometimes include \u201cbrought to you by Samsung\u201d in their bulletins. The numbers in prison have declined a bit; in 2021 there were 72 detained journalists in the Arab world, just 25% of the global total, down from 32% in 2020. But that is only because their reporting has become less critical."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Circulation and audience figures are treated as state secrets, so it is unclear whether ratings have slumped as programmes become more anodyne. But it is a fair bet. \u201cArabs are deserting the mainstream media,\u201d says Abdel Bari Atwan, a Palestinian journalist in London. In a survey of Arab youth in 2019 by Asda\u2019a, a UAE-based pollster, 80% favoured social media for their news, up from 25% in 2015.

The Saudi-owned MBC Group, the Arab world\u2019s largest media provider, shows multiple TV soap operas simultaneously. Still, Arab rulers may yet regret silencing the fourth estate, predicts Abdelaziz Alkhamis, a Saudi journalist. \u201cIf you can\u2019t alert leaders to the anger and problems in society, another Arab spring might surprise them again.\u201d \u25a0"}], "id": 32}
