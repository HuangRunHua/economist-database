He sees it as one more way the establishment tries to villainise artists like him and keep people from hearing their messages. When pressed he calls himself a Christian conservative rapper. Jesus, he notes with a chuckle, also \u201ctriggered some people\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Labels aside, Mr Townsend and rappers such as Forgiato Blow and Bryson Gray are the true culture warriors of the MAGA movement. By bringing rhyme, rhythm and the tropes of hip-hop to its messages of patriotism, gun rights, vaccine rejection, free speech and antipathy to abortion, they are churning out chart-topping singles and making MAGA seem edgy and subversive, the basic ingredients of cool. Their success is a sign that Mr Trump\u2019s politics will endure well beyond him."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Over lunch recently at Ronnie\u2019s Steak-N-Grill in Philadelphia, Mr Townsend pulled out his phone to play a rap he had just posted to Instagram opposing Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House. In the song, \u201cCircus\u201d, which he later polished over the internet with his producer in Romania and posted to other platforms, Mr Townsend calls Mr McCarthy a sell-out and mocks Mr Trump\u2019s order that conservative opponents \u201cknock it off\u201d:"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Townsend says he still supports Mr Trump for president in 2024, but is confused by his temporising on Mr McCarthy, abortion and other matters. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, \u2018Bro, these are hard issues we was all, like, for you for. And now you\u2019re changing up?\u2019\u201d He says he might be drawn to Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, if he runs. (In one blistering burst in his song \u201cDevil Want Our Kids\u201d, Mr Townsend chains \u201cDeSantis\u201d with \u201cchances\u201d, \u201cadvances\u201d, \u201ccampus\u201d and \u201cstances\u201d to condemn teaching children about gender identity and sexual orientation.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Townsend, 31, served as a cryptological analyst in the Air Force before moving to Philadelphia with his wife, a teacher. He loves the \u2018Sip, as he calls his state; you could not pay him to move to \u201cany of those Democrat-controlled cities\u201d. A fireplug of a man who raps\u2014and eats lunch\u2014in a MAGA-red knit cap, he can glower with the surliest of rappers. But his music can also be buoyant and empathetic and, in person, so is he. His influences range beyond Mr Trump to Booker T. Washington, Malcolm X and Eminem. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Townsend grew up in the hamlet of Kilmichael, Mississippi. His mother taught him to be the man of the house by ten years old, he says, but she drank, and his father, married to another woman, was not much in his life. When he was 12 or 13 one of his mother\u2019s boyfriends hit her in the face with a two-by-four, and as she bled it took an hour for the police to respond. \u201cI learned early on no one was coming to save me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what fuels my ideology today. No government, nobody.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Townsend\u2019s contempt for authority points to a reversal of cultural polarity under way in America. The left once drew energy from scorning authority and bourgeois convention. But as it becomes America\u2019s enforcer of social norms, it increasingly treats the arts as a tool for instruction. As a result it is surrendering what puts the arts in society\u2019s vanguard, the capacity to question and shock. What more transgressive act could an artist perform than to don a MAGA cap, as Kanye West did? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Townsend dismisses accusations of anti-Semitism against Mr West and is offended by the music industry\u2019s uneven moral standards, given that some rappers use the N-word and celebrate drug-dealing or violence against women. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t they censored that?\u201d he asks. \u201cSo they don\u2019t care about black people getting murdered?

The song went to No. 3 in Billboard\u2019s rap chart in December 2020.\u201d \u201cThis is where we make a stand, no more give or take,\u201d raps Mr Townsend. \u201cMarch around the capitol, storm the city gates.\u201d Those lyrics took on new weight after the two men performed the song near the Capitol on January 6th, and it vanished for a time from Spotify and other platforms (and subsequently surged to No. 1).
