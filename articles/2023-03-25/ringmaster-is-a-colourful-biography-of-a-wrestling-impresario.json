He seems to grasp that professional wrestling is fake\u2014meaning the outcomes of the matches are predetermined\u2014but assumes its fans do not. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In reality, as Abraham Riesman explains in \u201cRingmaster\u201d, his thorough but overwritten biography of Vince McMahon\u2014the majority owner of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and the man who turned wrestling into an entertainment behemoth\u2014many devoted fans are \u201csmarts\u201d rather than \u201cmarks\u201d. They know they are watching a scripted event more akin to a soap opera than a traditional sport. But they love it anyway, either despite its phoniness or, more likely, because of it. They are seeing athletic entertainers acting out storylines at once simple, driven by lust or grievance, and tortuous, with as many twists as an endless airplane novel. They maintain \u201cthe pose of belief so as not to be rude to their heroes\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those fans number in the tens of millions and are spread all over the world. Last year WWE, the publicly traded company that Mr McMahon built, had revenues of $1.3bn. Wrestlers of the past, such as Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant (pictured), sometimes dabbled in acting; more recent ones, such as John Cena and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, used their starts in wrestling to become genuine film stars. Donald Trump\u2019s career, meanwhile, has been intertwined with professional wrestling for more than three decades\u2014ever since, in the late 1980s, one of his casinos in Atlantic City was billed as the host of WrestleManias 4 and 5, jamborees that were actually held at other local venues."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump\u2019s spectre haunts this book, which really tells two stories, one more tenuous than the other. The first and better tale is about Mr McMahon himself, and his rise from rural and small-town poverty in North Carolina. Like some other successful businessmen\u2014indeed, like Mr Trump\u2014he passes himself off as self-made. In fact his father and grandfather, respectively Vince McMahon senior and Jess McMahon, were wrestling promoters in the sport\u2019s early ramshackle days, when it comprised a set of regional fiefdoms that did not compete with each other. But whereas Vince senior was, according to a relative, \u201cthe most loving man you\u2019d ever want to know\u201d, and held in great esteem and affection by the wrestlers in his stable, his son is said to be cold and ruthless."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He is also shrewd and ambitious, and was able to see that wrestling\u2019s fragmented structure was inefficient. An earlier generation of promoters feared television would kill the market for in-person wrestling; Mr McMahon embraced tv and celebrity. WrestleManias\u2014annual pay-per-view events running since 1985\u2014featured not just famous wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan and Mr T, but also appearances by Gloria Steinem, Geraldine Ferraro, Muhammad Ali and Andy Warhol (the first two in recorded clips). Under Mr McMahon, wrestling became, much like American football, better and somehow more authentically experienced on television than live."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWe have lived for a quarter of a century in the world Mr McMahon made,\u201d begins the book\u2019s final chapter. \u201cNot just wrestling fans\u2014all of us.\u201d Those sentences encapsulate its more tenuous story, which is that wrestling\u2019s fakery and Mr McMahon\u2019s ruthlessness somehow define contemporary America, rather than simply being an aspect of it. Doubtless this thesis will find favour on both America\u2019s Trumpian right and the far left, albeit for opposite reasons: the Trumpsters wholeheartedly embracing McMahonism, the left-wingers believing it reveals America\u2019s fundamental cynicism and moral bankruptcy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But readers who do not already agree with the author are unlikely to be persuaded. Cut-throat businessmen and dishonest politicians predate Messrs McMahon and Trump. They do not thrive only in America. Most Americans do not watch wrestling, just as most did not vote for Mr Trump. And if people find either the 45th president or wrestling distasteful, they can vote for someone else\u2014or change the channel. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
