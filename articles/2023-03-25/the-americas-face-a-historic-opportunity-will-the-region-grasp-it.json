The continent\u2019s trade in goods and services has quadrupled in nominal value since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into force in 1994, to more than $7trn, or roughly 30% of GDP. But that is slower than the sixfold growth in trade experienced by the rest of the world over that time. Intraregional trade connections have become denser in Europe and Asia. Canada and Mexico do oodles of business with the United States but little with each other. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The regional economy may be on the threshold of something bigger. A few forces are coming together now to boost its prospects. As tensions between the United States and China increase, companies that had come to rely on China for manufacturing are shifting to other bases. Production snafus during the covid-19 pandemic illustrated the fragility of globally dispersed supply chains. And the embrace by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration of industrial policy, fuelled by generous subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy, has super-charged investment in the United States. That inevitably is spilling over into Canada and Mexico.

On March 15th American regulators approved the first big railway merger in two decades, which will link all three countries.

Many of the world\u2019s biggest and most innovative companies are based in the United States. Mexico offers inexpensive labour and land right on its doorstep. Canada is richly endowed with natural resources, with a burgeoning tech ecosystem to boot. The heft of the consumer market in the United States plus the potential of Mexico\u2019s round off the enticing package. In practice, though, the car industry stands out as one of the few to truly embrace cross-border models, with production networks from Monterrey to Ontario tightly intertwined."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The question for North American officials and executives is whether they can pursue the same kind of integration in a wider range of strategically important sectors, from batteries to semiconductors. It is also a test of whether a shift now under way from globe-spanning trade to more regionally concentrated commerce is viable.

More than three-quarters of Mexico\u2019s exports go north of the border. The decision in February by Tesla, an American EV manufacturer, to build a plant in the northern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n has been hailed as a sign of things to come.

The primary one is energy. In an attempt to protect Mexico\u2019s ailing state electricity company, CFE, Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador introduced reforms which give priority to CFE\u2019s electricity, no matter how dirty or expensive its plants. This will reduce the scope for profitable investment in private generation, which in turn leaves Mexico potentially short of electricity. It also makes it more expensive. Meanwhile companies are struggling to get clean energy, which they need to meet their goals for reducing carbon emissions.

Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador got rid of ProM\u00e9xico, an organisation that promoted investment. Now states go out and sell themselves. There exist few federal incentives for investment. Some states offer cheap land, but not the tax breaks that many of their American counterparts do. Nevertheless, this lack of support is more likely to slow the tide than stop it.

With an economy less than a tenth the size of the United States\u2019, Canada cannot compete dollar for dollar, but it can target specific parts of supply chains. Dennis Darby of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, an industry group, says that, without more support from the government, Canada faces the risk of capital draining away. Some companies, he says, are being told by their American customers that they could cut costs by moving south of the border. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "An indication that Canadian officials may be up to the challenge came on March 13th when Volkswagen, a German carmaker, announced that it would build its first EV battery plant outside Europe in Ontario. Neither the federal government nor the provincial government has spelled out the incentives involved, but the budget may shed light on them. Volkswagen\u2019s investment also reflects the fact that at least some of the Biden administration\u2019s policies are designed with the broader region in mind. Tax credits for buyers of EVs specify that the content can be made anywhere in North America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Canada has a partial head start in shifting towards a cleaner growth model. Mr Trudeau\u2019s government introduced a carbon-pricing system in 2018, pushing businesses to invest in more efficient facilities. Many in industry complain that Canada\u2019s policies amount to a big stick, whereas the United States is lavishing carrots on its companies with its suite of incentives. On closer analysis, though, the problem in Canada is sometimes not a lack of incentives but rather that its carrots are chopped-up and messy. The Canadian Climate Institute, a campaign group, calculates that subsidies due in 2030 for carbon-capture investments in Alberta\u2019s oil industry are spread across several pools but run to C$135-275 per sequestered tonne, more than the C$115 per tonne on offer in Texas. Rather than piling on more subsidies, the task for Canada is to streamline what it already offers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Perhaps the biggest thing that Canada brings to the North American table is its richness of natural resources. Canada has a relatively small share\u20143% or so\u2014of the world\u2019s known reserves of critical minerals such as lithium and manganese, which are needed for batteries, semiconductors, hydrogen fuel cells and more. But the government believes that much more lies beneath the ground, and is working to encourage more exploration, unveiling its first critical-minerals strategy at the end of 2022. Marc Gilbert of Boston Consulting Group thinks Canada needs to get a foothold in higher-value segments of the industry. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Canada, like Mexico, is already heavily dependent on the United States, with three-quarters of its exports going there. That figure would probably only increase if Canada ramps up its production of critical minerals. Some of the businesses that straddle the continent are bullish. At his company\u2019s headquarters in Vaughan, Ontario, Rob Wildeboer of Martinrea, a car-parts company, sits in an office that displays both a bottle of fine tequila from Mexico and a large photograph of a Canadian ice-hockey match. He envisions a more closely integrated North America, in which he would be able to bring workers from Mexico into the United States and Canada for short stints. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be North America\u2019s century,\u201d he says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Economic data counsel caution. Manufacturing in North America is worth about $2.5trn per year. In Asia it is closer to $7.5trn. China\u2019s factory sector alone is about 20 times larger than Mexico\u2019s. Nevertheless, it is salutary to remember that the United States is not attempting to lure all industry away from China. Rather, it is focused on segments such as batteries and semiconductors that it has deemed especially important to its national security and its economic future. It will not be easy. But with Canada and Mexico pulling in the same direction, it has a far better shot than going it alone. \u25a0"}], "id": 34}
