But Mr Xi is untroubled by such details: he and Mr Putin are united in their belief in the inexorable decline of the American-led system, with its supposed concern for rules and human rights. They want to replace it with a more transactional mechanism involving of deals between great powers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "We considered using the two men on the cover. One idea was to put their faces on a flag, an image that harked back to the days when Lenin and Stalin were in the vanguard of world revolution. It implied that there is a new anti-Western alliance and that Mr Putin is an equal partner in the endeavour. Another idea felt rather closer to the mark. This had a miniature Mr Putin sitting on Mr Xi\u2019s shoulder. Despite the pomp, banquets and interminably long red carpets designed to show off Russian power, Mr Putin is the supplicant and Mr Xi his overlord.

However, our reporters felt that this design overstated China\u2019s sway over Russia, and suggested that Iran is a Chinese client when, in reality, it is wayward and unruly. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "We ended up with a Sinocentric nucleus, with states whizzing around it like so many electrons. Its aesthetic harps back to depictions of the atom from the 1960s, adding to the growing sense of a new cold war. We put Saudi Arabian and Iranian flags in the same orbit, to do justice to the two countries\u2019 Chinese-mediated detente. And we included the United Nations, as a sign that China is not looking for geographic expansion so much as to capture the machinery of diplomacy."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230325_DE_US.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1684.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Leader: The world according to XiInternational: What does Xi Jinping want from Vladimir Putin?Briefing: Iran wants a detente with its neighbours but not with America"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For subscribers only: to see how we design each week\u2019s cover, sign up to our weekly Cover Story newsletter."}]}
