This virtual space would form \u201ca new economy that is larger than our current economy\u201d, promised Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a chipmaker. Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook\u2019s name to Meta and called it a \u201cmetaverse company\u201d. The buzzword featured over 500 times on company earning calls in the final quarter of 2021, says a tally by GlobalData, a research firm. But the metaverse has fallen out of fashion. It became linked to the boosterism for cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens before their crash in 2022. Investors\u2019 excitement turned to impatience, not least at Meta, whose share price plunged by 65% last year. Last month Mr Zuckerberg announced cuts and a \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One reason for disillusionment with these virtual worlds is the slow pace of improvement of virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), technologies that bring such environments to life. About a quarter of American adults under 40 own a VR headset, largely thanks to Meta, which sold truckloads of its Quest 2 goggles to a bored, locked-down audience. But headsets are more of a novelty than the ubiquitous platform Mr Zuckerberg predicted. Apple\u2019s first headset, due later this year, may cost several thousand dollars. \u201cThere\u2019s a very high entry-barrier for users, particularly in emerging countries,\u201d says Kim Chang-han, chief executive of Krafton, whose free games are played mostly on mobile phones."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The delayed arrival of good, cheap VR and AR technology means most immersive online experiences are still on ordinary screens, where games are the leaders. \u201cI didn\u2019t see video games coming when I wrote \u2018Snow Crash\u2019.

GenVid Technologies, which created the hybrid game-cum-show, will launch a similar experience based on \u201cSilent Hill\u201d, a long-running video game. Netflix has used streaming to create interactive TV shows where viewers can choose how the plot develops. And where once people watched fitness videos, increasingly they play fitness games.
