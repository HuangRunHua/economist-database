As one player gives a presentation, others do their best to interrupt and make a nuisance of themselves. By pressing different buttons they can heckle, burp or go to sleep.

Smartphones give everyone a way to record and publish home videos in seconds. The result is that even as professional content has become more plentiful and lavishly financed, viewers spend more time on amateur content. Americans under 18 spend almost twice as much time on TikTok and YouTube as on Netflix and Disney+, says Qustodio, which makes parental-control software."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many wonder if this may happen to gaming. User-made games already have a vast reach among young people. In 2020, amid covid-19 lockdowns, Roblox estimated that three-quarters of American 9- to 12-year-olds were using the platform. \u201cMinecraft\u201d, a Microsoft-owned game that lets players visit each others\u2019 constructions, has 120m monthly players. Like YouTube and TikTok, most user-made stuff is low quality. But like those sites, algorithmic sifting of a near-infinite variety serves up plenty for users."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As on YouTube, ever more content on platforms like Roblox is professionally made. Some small developers have shifted to the platform, aiming for a share of the $600m earned by creators each year. Big brands use it as a place to reach new audiences. Sega has licensed a Sonic game to Roblox. As on YouTube, where creators like Jimmy \u201cMrBeast\u201d Donaldson began as amateurs before turning professional, many successful developers made games as a hobby before going full-time. Simple Games, which makes such Roblox titles as \u201cWar Simulator\u201d, began as a hobby for its founder, Nathan Clemens, and now employs his whole family."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230325_SRC014.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 681.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The big difference between films and gaming is that game developers have proved more adept at incorporating user-made content into their productions.

Many recent hits have been online titles like \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d or \u201cFortnite\u201d, in which the thrills come from interaction with other users. \u201cBecause players are infinitely creative, you can make the sandbox, throw some people in there, and the player stories that come out of that emergent play are endless,\u201d says Allen Adham of Blizzard Entertainment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Enlisting players to entertain each other means games stay entertaining for longer. \u201cIf you look at the biggest games, there is demand from the players that it\u2019s constantly refreshed\u2026and creating game content is a long process,\u201d says Tom Wijman of Newzoo, a game analyst. \u201cPart of the reason why gaming companies are so eager to stimulate [user-generated content] and incorporate it into their day-to-day business is because it helps them crowdsource this content creation that has become expected by the gaming community\u201d. Mr Adham says \u201cplayer v player\u201d games \u201ccan be very production-efficient, because the players are providing the diversity of play\u201d. Sometimes the creation of new content is well managed. Online fans of games like \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d organise together to plan elaborate role-playing scenarios\u2014bank heists, police chases and so on\u2014before playing them together, often broadcasting the action on video platforms such as Twitch."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The complexity of making a game is a natural brake on how much original content users can generate. Meta\u2019s flagship virtual-reality app, \u201cHorizon Worlds\u201d, has struggled to attract users, partly because it relies on user-made virtual environments that few amateurs are able to build. Yet there is an expectation that artificial intelligence (AI) will make things much easier. Roblox has shown off a forthcoming feature that will let developers use ai to program games with simple text prompts, such as \u201cmake it rain\u201d. Microsoft has reportedly come up with a voice-activated ai assistant for \u201cMinecraft\u201d that builds structures on demand. Niantic, which makes augmented-reality games and apps, has developed a tool to create interactive 3D models using voice instructions. Apple, which may release a virtual-reality headset later this year, is working on similar technology."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whether in film or in gaming, demand for user-made content is growing. \u201cThis younger generation doesn\u2019t just want content thrown at them,\u201d says Craig Donato, Roblox\u2019s chief business officer. \u201cThey want to feel a sense of agency or co-ownership of the medium\u2026[and] that they are not just consumers of content, but that they can also be participants in the creation of the content.\u201d The video-game business has done a better job than Hollywood of turning this to its advantage.\u25a0"}]}
