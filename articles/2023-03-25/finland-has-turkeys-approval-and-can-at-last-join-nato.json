Step off the road and you sink to your thighs, as the Soviet army\u2019s 44th Rifle Division found when it invaded Finland during the Winter War of 1939-40. Once its 14,000 men, 530 trucks and 44 tanks had passed the border village of Raate, the Finns blew up its lead and rear vehicles. For weeks, while the trapped column froze and starved, Finnish ski troops in white camouflage glided through the woods slicing it to bits. The division\u2019s commander struggled back to Soviet lines, where commissars had him shot."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most Soviet soldiers were Russian, but those on the Raate road were Ukrainian. Some 82 years later, Ukrainians fighting for their own country would trap and smash a Russian army on a motorway north of Kyiv using much the same tactics the Finns had. Finland reacted with a shock of recognition. It abandoned its policy of military neutrality, first forced on it by the Soviets, and applied to join NATO. Its neutral neighbour Sweden did the same."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230325_EUM933.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 814.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since then both countries\u2019 applications have been held up by Turkey. The Turks\u2019 main problem is with Sweden, which it accuses of harbouring various enemies. In January Turkey suggested it might admit Finland alone, an idea the Finns at first resisted out of solidarity. Yet they have gradually come to accept the notion. On March 17th Sauli Niinisto, Finland\u2019s president, visited Ankara. There Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his Turkish counterpart, announced he would start the process of ratification."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Erdogan has left Sweden hanging, demanding the deportation of more than 100 people he calls \u201cterrorists\u201d, mainly Kurdish \u00e9migr\u00e9s. The Turkish president faces an election on May 14th, and bashing the Swedes is useful campaign fodder\u2014the more so since a far-right Danish politician burnt a copy of the Koran in front of Turkey\u2019s embassy in Stockholm in January. Letting in Finland curries favour with America, which has been delaying selling Turkey F-16 fighter jets. Mr Erdogan also needs goodwill from NATO members, which he hopes will help Turkey rebuild after an earthquake in February."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For Finland, joining NATO makes some things simpler. Under neutrality Finnish leaders \u201chad to be mini-Kissingers\u201d, pragmatically balancing their Western orientation and the eastern threat, says Ilkka Haavisto of EVA, a think-tank in Helsinki. Now deepening their Western alignment is itself pragmatic. NATO\u2019s guarantee of mutual defence will help Finland protect its 1,300km-long border with Russia.

The war has also made it much harder for Russian propagandists to influence public opinion.

In Suomussalmi, relations had recently been friendly. Finns crossed into Russia to buy cheap petrol; Russians bought holiday houses and took summer jobs picking berries on farms. Now that is over. Most Finns do not dislike Russians as individuals: the Raate road has monuments to the Ukrainian and Russian soldiers who died there. The Russian state is another matter.

In a compartment behind his garage he keeps a miniature museum of vintage gear: Soviet helmets; a Finnish submachine-gun. An old metal plate bears words scratched in Russian: \u201cNo food.
