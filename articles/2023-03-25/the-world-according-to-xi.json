Meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week, China\u2019s leader spoke of \u201cpeaceful co-existence and win-win co-operation\u201d, while supping with somebody facing an international arrest warrant for war crimes. But Mr Xi is untroubled by trivial inconsistencies. He believes in the inexorable decline of the American-led world order, with its professed concern for rules and human rights. He aims to twist it into a more transactional system of deals between great powers. Do not underestimate the perils of this vision\u2014or its appeal around the world."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On Ukraine China has played an awkward hand ruthlessly and well. Its goals are subtle: to ensure Russia is subordinate but not so weak that Mr Putin\u2019s regime implodes; to burnish its own credentials as a peacemaker in the eyes of the emerging world; and, with an eye on Taiwan, to undermine the perceived legitimacy of Western sanctions and military support as a tool of foreign policy. Mr Xi has cynically proposed a \u201cpeace plan\u201d for Ukraine that would reward Russian aggression and which he knows Ukraine will not accept. It calls for \u201crespecting the sovereignty of all countries\u201d, but neglects to mention that Russia occupies more than a sixth of its neighbour."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is just one example of China\u2019s new approach to foreign policy, as the country emerges from zero-covid isolation to face a more unified West. On March 10th China brokered a detente between two bitter rivals, Iran and Saudi Arabia\u2014a first intervention in the Middle East, which highlighted the West\u2019s reduced clout there 20 years after the American-led invasion of Iraq. On March 15th Mr Xi unveiled the \u201cGlobal Civilisation Initiative\u201d, which argues that countries should \u201crefrain from imposing their own values or models on others and from stoking ideological confrontation.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s approach is not improvised, but systematic and ideological. Deng Xiaoping urged China to \u201chide your capacities, bide your time\u201d. But Mr Xi wants to reshape the post-1945 world order. China\u2019s new slogans seek to borrow and subvert the normative language of the 20th century so that \u201cmultilateralism\u201d becomes code for a world that ditches universal values and is run by balancing great-power interests. The \u201cGlobal Security Initiative\u201d is about opposing efforts to contain China\u2019s military threat; the \u201cGlobal Development Initiative\u201d promotes China\u2019s economic-growth model, which deals with autocratic states without imposing conditions. \u201cGlobal Civilisation\u201d argues that Western advocacy of universal human rights, in Xinjiang and elsewhere, is a new kind of colonialism."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This transactional worldview has more support outside the West than you may think. Later this month in Beijing Mr Xi will meet Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, an advocate of a multipolar world, who wants China to help negotiate peace in Ukraine. To many, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 exposed the West\u2019s double standards on international law and human rights, a point China\u2019s state media are busy hammering home. After the Trump years, President Joe Biden has re-engaged with the world but the pivot to Asia involves downsizing elsewhere, including in the Middle East and Afghanistan."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The West has shown resolve over Ukraine, but many countries are ambivalent about the war and wonder how it will end. At least 100 countries, accounting for 40% of global gdp, are not fully enforcing sanctions. American staying power is doubted. Neither Donald Trump nor Ron DeSantis, his Republican rival, sees Ukraine as a core American interest. All this creates space for new actors, from Turkey to the uae, and above all, China. Its message\u2014that real democracy entails economic development, but does not depend on political liberty\u2014greatly appeals to the elites of non-democratic countries."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is important to assess what this mercenary multipolarity can achieve. Iran and Saudi Arabia have been fierce enemies ever since the Iranian revolution in 1979. China is the biggest export market for both, so it has clout and an incentive to forestall war in the Gulf, which is also its largest source of oil. The agreement it has helped broker may de-escalate a proxy war in Yemen that has killed perhaps 300,000 people. Or take climate change. Chinese mercantilist support for its battery industry is a catalyst for a wave of cross-border investment that will help lower carbon emissions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the real point of Mr Xi\u2019s foreign policy is to make the world safer for the Chinese Communist Party. Over time, its flaws will be hard to hide. A mesh of expedient bilateral relationships creates contradictions. China has backed Iran but chosen to ignore its ongoing nuclear escalation, which threatens China\u2019s other clients in the region. In Ukraine any durable peace requires the consent of Ukrainians. It should also involve accountability for war crimes and guarantees against another attack. China objects to all three: it does not believe in democracy, human rights or constraining great powers\u2014whether in Ukraine or Taiwan. Countries that face a direct security threat from China, such as India and Japan, will grow even warier. Indeed, wherever a country faces a powerful, aggressive neighbour, the principle that might is right means that it will have more to fear."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Because China almost always backs ruling elites, however inept or cruel, its approach may eventually outrage ordinary people around the world. Until that moment, open societies will face a struggle over competing visions. One task is to stop Ukraine being pushed into a bogus peace deal, and for Western countries to deepen their defensive alliances, including nato. The long-run goal is to rebut the charge that global rules serve only Western interests and to expose the poverty of the worldview that China\u2014and Russia\u2014are promoting."}, {"role": "body", "text": "America\u2019s great insight in 1945 was that it could make itself more secure by binding itself to lasting alliances and common rules. That idealistic vision has been tarnished by decades of contact with reality, including in Iraq. But the Moscow summit reveals a worse alternative: a superpower that seeks influence without winning affection, power without trust and a global vision without universal human rights. Those who believe this will make the world a better place should think again."}], "id": 4}
