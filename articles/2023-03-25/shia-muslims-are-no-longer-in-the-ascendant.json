One is Qassem Suleimani, the long-serving commander of the Quds force, the foreign arm of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC); the other is Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the commander of the beefiest umbrella group of Shia militias in Iraq, whose grave is at the shrine. (Suleimani is buried in southern Iran.) Both were killed three years ago in Baghdad by an American drone strike aimed at Suleimani, whose job was to protect and spread the Shia revolution across the region.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Were it not for America\u2019s invasion of Iraq 20 years ago, the Shia resurgence might never have happened. Iran\u2019s Islamic revolution in 1979 launched the project to elevate the region\u2019s minority. But the dismantling of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Sunni-led regime heralded its spread, replacing it with a government system that put Iraq\u2019s Shia majority in charge. Uprisings in the Arab spring of 2011 shook the region\u2019s Sunni order still more, creating power vacuums that Iran often sought to fill."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Under Iran\u2019s baton, Shia militiamen poured into Syria from as far afield as Afghanistan and Pakistan. In Lebanon a Shia political movement-cum-militia, Hizbullah, became the country\u2019s dominant force. In Yemen a Shia revivalist militia under the Houthi banner swept into Sana\u2019a, the capital. From north, south and east Shia militias launched their drones at Saudi Arabia, the bastion of Sunni Islam, striking its royal palaces in the capital, Riyadh, and briefly incapacitating half of the kingdom\u2019s oil supply. In 2004 King Abdullah of Jordan lamented that a new \u201cShia crescent\u201d was endangering the old Sunni world.

They have routed the Sunni jihadists who created the caliphate that straddled eastern Syria and north-western Iraq. And they have gathered a vast arsenal, with an estimated 150,000 missiles pointing at Israel alone.

Incomes have plummeted, currencies have crashed and inflation has soared across the Shia crescent. Lebanon\u2019s pound is the world\u2019s worst-performing currency this year. The Syrian pound has fallen from 47 to the dollar before the Arab spring in 2011 to 7,550 this year. Iran\u2019s economy has struggled since America walked away from a nuclear deal in 2018 that had eased sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment. Its currency has since slumped from about 45,000 rials per dollar to a low of about 580,000. (Before the revolution in 1979 a dollar would buy 70 rials.)

Alone among Shia states it retained its ties to the global economy under American tutelage. But its power-brokers squandered its oil wealth. Across the wider region Shia militia leaders have exploited the black economy, overseeing smuggling rings and the mass production of recreational drugs. Even in Lebanon, once the leading banking centre of the Middle East, Shia leaders have shared in the catastrophic mismanagement of the economy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Democracy in Iran, the self-proclaimed beacon of Shia governance, has shrivelled, even within the tight confines of clerical rule. Turnout in Iran\u2019s election in 2021 was the lowest since 1979. In Iraq, among Shias, it has fallen from 80% after the fall of Saddam Hussein by more than half to perhaps 20% in 2021, when independent candidates topped the poll.

Many are increasingly discarding the veil, once hailed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the regime\u2019s founder, as \u201cthe flag\u201d of the Islamic Republic.

In some mosques in Baghdad\u2019s middle-class neighbourhoods, clerics have abandoned their Friday sermons because they no longer draw crowds.

His succession is shrouded in doubt. None of the front-runners seems likely to revive the regime\u2019s fortunes. Ebrahim Raisi, Iran\u2019s turbaned president, is lampooned by fellow clerics for his lack of religious qualifications. Mr Khamenei\u2019s son, Mojtaba, has sought them by teaching in Qom. But his nomination would smack of the dynastic rule that Iran\u2019s revolution cast aside. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The choice is limited because Mr Khamenei long ago silenced Muhammad Khatami, a former president who has called for a \u201cfundamental transformation\u201d of the system.

The IRGC already dominates Iran\u2019s armed forces, the parliament, the intelligence services and perhaps 40% of the economy, so a coup is far from unthinkable. \u201cWe\u2019re living in suspended animation between one era and the next,\u201d says a university lecturer."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Should the IRGC seize the reins, says a government adviser, it would ditch the clerics\u2019 isolationism and reach out to the West\u201d.

The IRGC might even drop, or reduce, Iran\u2019s support for its allies abroad, such as in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.

This is less overtly political, because Iraq\u2019s electoral system is not under the thumb of theocrats in the same way that Iran\u2019s is.

President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is also doing his own thing. He has recently been welcomed with honours in the United Arab Emirates, visited Oman and received Egypt\u2019s foreign minister.
