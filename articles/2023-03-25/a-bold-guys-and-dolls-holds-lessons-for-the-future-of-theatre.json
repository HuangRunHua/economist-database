Actors can miss cues or forget lines, dancers and jokes may fall flat. Punters risk forking out royally for tickets only to hate the play. Producers are subject to the vagaries of the economy and (if they rely on it) statutory funding, not to mention the lightning strike of a pandemic. If the show bombs, they risk losing their shirts."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That fate will not befall the new \u201cGuys &amp; Dolls\u201d at the Bridge Theatre in London. Set in a charmed, harmless New York underworld, Frank Loesser\u2019s musical of 1950, adapted from Damon Runyon\u2019s stories, features two pairs of wires-crossed lovers. Sky Masterson is a hustler who bets he can take a mission leader, Sarah Brown, on a date to Havana. For 14 years, meanwhile, two-bit craps promoter Nathan Detroit has been engaged to Miss Adelaide, a fixture at the Hot Box\u2014a night spot where, in this version, some of the choreography is downright filthy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The performances are uniformly strong, especially Marisha Wallace\u2019s knockout Adelaide. The salient feature of this revival, however, is its immersive staging. About a third of the audience stands, doubling as bystanders to the high jinks that unfold in their midst (an approach that Sir Nicholas Hytner, the director, used for \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d and \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d, which enlisted punters as the Roman mob). Stage platforms rise and fall from the floor in assorted configurations, lampposts and manholes artfully indicating new locales. Ushers dressed as cops keep order."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Configuring the theatre this way, says Sir Nicholas, means that the people \u201cpaying the least are closest to the action\u201d. The intimacy and exuberance rub off on the folk in the posh seats, too. \u201cSheer bliss,\u201d cooed the Times. \u201cSure to be a smash hit,\u201d said the New York Times. If this show were a gate, it\u2019d be swinging."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The same cannot be said for the gates of theatre in general. Audiences in Britain are still down on pre-pandemic levels, as are those on Broadway. Although it spurred innovations in streaming, the coronavirus wrecked productions and careers. In Britain it has been followed by a squeeze on state funding for some high-profile playhouses (but not the Bridge, which doesn\u2019t take any)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Beyond the pandemic loom the spectres of Netflix and changing tastes, and a fear that the TikTok generation will be disinclined to sit through \u201cKing Lear\u201d, or even \u201cGuys &amp; Dolls\u201d. Impresarios differ over the right fix: whether to trim costs or invest in razzmatazz, put on cutting-edge work or classics (staples such as \u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d are doing best on Broadway, says Charlotte St Martin of the Broadway League, a trade association). Star names sell, if you can get them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a way, \u201cGuys &amp; Dolls\u201d is a much safer bet than most of Nathan Detroit\u2019s. As the musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein did after the second world war, it supplies neon-lit flamboyance after pinched grey years, and a sequence of earworm songs that you didn\u2019t realise you knew. In an artistic sense, though, the moral of this triumphant tale of chancers lies in its boldness and risks."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If theatre is a tightrope walk, Sir Nicholas raises the rope, not only because of the pinpoint choreography in cramped spaces. The immersive method adds another risk: that the spectators won\u2019t play ball. They are called on to take leaflets from Bible-bashers and share drinks with gamblers. Each night one finds himself at a table in the Hot Box and is clasped to Adelaide\u2019s cleavage (ushers forewarn him, Sir Nicholas confides)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The real trick, in other words, is not what happens on the shifting stage but in the crowd. \u201cIn the theatre\u201d, wrote the great director Peter Brook, \u201cthe audience completes the steps of creation.\u201d This is an age-old insight. It can be traced through Antonin Artaud\u2019s interwar \u201ctheatre of cruelty\u201d\u2014which aimed to unsettle viewers with sound and light\u2014to Shakespeare\u2019s collusive jokes about mad Englishmen, all the way back to the origins of Greek drama in religious rites. The magic happens when a group of strangers, typically sitting in the dark, conspire in turning spectacle into art. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But in a digital age, that principle is more urgent than ever. Just as high-street retailers are surviving by selling what websites cannot, from oven-fresh bread to tattoos, theatre will prosper if it \u201cdoubles down on its liveness\u201d, as Sir Nicholas puts it, offering people \u201can experience that they can\u2019t have looking at a screen\u201d. At the end of this \u201cGuys &amp; Dolls\u201d, the cast dances with a jubilant audience. As Sky Masterson almost says: it isn\u2019t wrong to gamble, only to lose."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:It\u2019s war at this year\u2019s Oscars (Mar 8th)How an Ethiopian prince came to be buried at Windsor Castle (Feb 23rd)The genius of Johannes Vermeer is on display as never before (Feb 8th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
