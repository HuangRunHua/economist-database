If you are going to put a red pen through Roald Dahl\u2014as his publisher, Puffin, did recently\u2014there are so many better bits to choose. The sensitivity readers contented themselves with excising such words as \u201cfat\u201d, \u201cflabby\u201d, \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cKipling\u201d. But Dahl doesn\u2019t merely offer sexism, racism and colonialism; in his adult fiction you can find sins so frankly filthsome and swigpilling there has yet to be an -ism coined to cover them. There is violence, voyeurism and an unforgettably frightsome story in which a scorpion collector accidentally has sex with a leper. Not for nothing did his family call him \u201cRoald the Rotten\u201d and\u2014more bluntly\u2014\u201cRoald the Bastard\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Something seems to be changing in British publishing. You can see it in the sheepish announcement from Puffin after news of its edits prompted a backlash, that Roald the Revolting will still roll off the presses unaltered, alongside the works of Roald the Redacted. You can see it, too, in almost-silenced books that are now thriving. \u201cTime to Think\u201d, a book by Hannah Barnes about the Tavistock\u2019s gender-identity clinic in London, which referred children as young as nine for puberty blockers, was rejected by 22 publishers. Swift Press, a nimble newcomer, took it on and it made the bestseller lists. People in the industry suggest that the red pen is being wielded less freely. As one publishing executive puts it, there is a sense that things \u201chad gone too far\u201d. (Though since this person did not want to be quoted by name, not far enough.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A change is overdue. The editing of Dahl by Puffin, an imprint of Penguin, was a symptom of something frogglehumping in the publishing world, but far from the only one. Authors have been dropped; books have been buried; people have lost jobs; sensitivity readers have been employed to ensure modern morals are adhered to. James Bond has even been edited to make him less vile\u2014the literary equivalent of trying to make water less wet. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is a line of argument that says that this isn\u2019t really a problem. Suppression of speech, this argument runs, is the preserve of totalitarian, Orwellian-style states and institutions that use force to stop people speaking out. In a country like Britain, speech is still free. This is pure gobblefunk and Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d is the wrong Orwellian work to understand why. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Better by far to turn to an introduction Orwell wrote for \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d. Orwell had finished his satire on the Soviet Union\u2014which many consider his masterpiece\u2014in 1943, whereupon it was promptly rejected by four publishers. As with Ms Barnes\u2019s 22 rejections, some offered reasons. One publisher pleasingly suggested Orwell might want to rethink the pigs. Having swine as the ruling class might \u201cgive offence\u2026particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are\u201d. Orwell kept the pigs; \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d sold half a million copies in two years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He later reflected on all this in that introduction. There is, he wrote, a \u201cveiled censorship\u201d in British publishing. \u201cAt any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question.\u201d It is \u201cnot exactly forbidden to say this, that or the other, but it is \u2018not done\u2019 to say it\u201d. Anyone who tries to do so \u201cfinds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness\u201d. They still do. A book on colonialism by Nigel Biggar, an emeritus professor of theology at Oxford University, was welcomed by its publisher, Bloomsbury, as a work of \u201cmajor importance\u201d and then postponed, apparently indefinitely, because \u201cpublic feeling\u2026does not currently support the publication of the book\u201d. It is now out under a different publisher."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What is striking is how apparently mild the sanctions are for speaking out. People think, as one author puts it, that you are afraid of Twitter death threats. You aren\u2019t: what really terrifies you is that your colleagues will think a little less of you. Most people do not require the threat of being burned at the stake to shut them up; being flamed by their peers on Twitter is more than enough. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is true of more typically Orwellian states, too. When Anne Applebaum studied the Sovietisation of central Europe, the historian found political conformity was \u201cthe result not of violence or direct state coercion, but rather of intense peer pressure\u201d. Publishing, an industry in which every third person is called Sophie, seems particularly susceptible to such pressure. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "All this involves no laws, no police, nor even any obvious threats. Polite people write polite emails and books are politely buried. \u201cThe sinister fact about literary censorship in England\u201d, Orwell wrote, \u201cis that it is largely voluntary.\u201d To go against that ominously amorphous \u201cpublic feeling\u201d is deeply uncomfortable. Ms Barnes found writing her book about the Tavistock\u2019s clinic hard not because she thought it was wrong but because \u201cI thought: \u2018People are not going to like me.\u2019\u201d Publishers are equally nervy. In the name of looking likeable they panic and pre-empt offence: they cull the pigs; drop the book on colonialism; cut the foulsome bits."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Swinebuggling stuff"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The problem with all this nervousness\u2014this desire-to-look-nice-ness\u2014is that it has very nasty results. In \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d, a novel by Ray Bradbury, a society has taken to burning all books lest any cause offence. As one character explains: \u201cDon\u2019t step on the toes of the\u2026second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen\u2026.\u201d This book-burning wasn\u2019t mandated by the government. \u201cThere was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship to start with, no!
