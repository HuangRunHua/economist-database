In a classroom furnished with desks for 28 students, he sits in quiet concentration as a teacher holds forth.

The school, which charges about $500 a month for three sessions a week, advertises itself as \u201cthe quickest way to become a pro gamer\u201d.

Parents were sceptical when the Seoul Gaming Academy opened in 2011, says its director, Park Se-woon. Today they see gaming as a good living, not least since those who don\u2019t make it as e-athletes often forge careers in game development.

Players pack up their keyboards and bow, while fans (mainly girls) wait outside with love-letters and flowers.
