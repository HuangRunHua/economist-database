To conjure the noise of a skeletal monster rising from the ground, he crunches crab shells. For a laser gun, he hooks a slinky to the back of a chair and flicks it: peeoww!

As technology lets games grow larger and more lifelike, they have taken on Hollywood-style budgets and timetables. And as the line between film and digital games blurs, that has two effects. One is that labour markets and production techniques for gaming converge with those of the film business, to the point where some envisage a single production process. The other is that game studios become more focused even than film studios on monetising a few successful franchises."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Allen Adham and two college chums founded what is now Blizzard Entertainment in 1991, making a game didn\u2019t require many people. \u201cRock n\u2019 Roll Racing\u201d, one of Blizzard\u2019s early hits, had a development team of ten, he recalls. Today at Blizzard\u2019s campus, south of Los Angeles, some games are developed by teams of over 500. Leaps in graphical fidelity have created jobs that did not exist; six or more people might work only on lighting effects. In some ways creating a game is harder than making a film, says Rod Fergusson, who is in charge of Blizzard\u2019s \u201cDiablo\u201d series. \u201cMovies have a language and a process that everyone understands,\u201d he says. With games, \u201cyou have to reinvent the camera every time.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Across the industry, an AAA game (the highest-fidelity sort) might take anything between three and seven years to make. Budgets are kept quiet, but \u201cCyberpunk 2077\u201d, one of the biggest releases of 2020, was said by its Polish developer, CD Projekt, to have cost 1.2bn zlotys ($275m), which represents a chunky amount even by Hollywood standards."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As games become more like films, movie people move in. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crossover now with these various labour markets\u2026the skill set is very interchangeable,\u201d says Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions, which makes films and TV series based on Sony\u2019s games. Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog, who created \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d, a hit PlayStation game, co-wrote a TV adaptation released by HBO in January; HBO\u2019s cinematographer paid a return visit to Naughty Dog to share TV techniques. In Los Angeles actors and writers increasingly divide their time between filmed and interactive entertainment: Keanu Reeves had a role in \u201cCyberpunk 2077\u201d, and George R.R. Martin, creator of the Game of Thrones series, wrote the backstory for \u201cElden Ring\u201d, one of last year\u2019s biggest games.

Sega\u2019s \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 2\u201d and Sony\u2019s \u201cUncharted\u201d were among last year\u2019s highest-grossing films. A new \u201cMario\u201d movie from Nintendo is due in April and a \u201cGran Turismo\u201d film from Sony in August.

They know all our IPs,\u201d says Utsumi Shuji of Sega, who likens his company to a \u201ctreasure island\u201d of properties that are ripe for exploitation. Julia Alexander of Parrot Analytics, a research firm, says \u201cGaming will be in the 2020s what comics IP was in the \u201900s and \u201910s.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Turning games into films and vice-versa is becoming easier as the two use the same technology. Game \u201cengines\u201d, 3D-modelling tools used to make realistic playable environments, can also make virtual sets for TV productions such as \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d, a Star Wars spinoff made by Disney with the help of Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine. For the \u201cGran Turismo\u201d movie, digital models from the PlayStation game rehearsed stunts and shots, says Mr Qizilbash.

For now, a game\u2019s environment is more interactive than a film\u2019s; and films\u2019 backdrops are higher fidelity than games\u2019. But the two production processes are converging from the gaming side. \u201cThe gamemakers have a more demanding set of requirements for these virtual worlds than the film-makers do. So somebody\u2019s going to invest in a [gaming] simulation that\u2019s photo-realistic. And then they\u2019re going to shoot a movie in it,\u201d says one Hollywood executive. \u201cIt will happen.

Many film fans complain that the box office is overrun with sequels and remakes, as studios become less willing to risk blockbuster budgets on unknown products. All of 2022\u2019s ten highest-grossing movies in America were part of a franchise, from \u201cAvatar\u201d to \u201cThe Batman\u201d. Games, whose lead time makes it even riskier to try new things, have become more predictable. Seven of last year\u2019s ten most-played games on PCs and consoles featured in the previous year\u2019s top ten, says Newzoo, a data company, which studied 37 mainly rich markets. One of this year\u2019s big releases is the 16th instalment of Square Enix\u2019s \u201cFinal Fantasy\u201d, a Japanese series running since 1987."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Subscriber models"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Where movies are locked in endless sequels and prequels, game-makers have found different new ways to wring money from old hits. Developers used to finish making a game and go on holiday. Today, \u201cShipping the game is just the beginning. The real work starts after that,\u201d says Mr Adham. Rather than merely release sequels, Blizzard has turned \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d into a subscription service, with regular updates to maps, missions and characters for those willing to pay. This setup, which is known as \u201cgames as a service\u201d, keeps gamers engaged (and spending) year after year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The model has proved itself.

But, facing competition from rivals such as \u201cFortnite\u201d, it went free in January 2022, instead charging players for extra features. \u201cTo get more users we went free-to-play, because more users is more fun,\u201d says Kim Chang-han, Krafton\u2019s chief executive. It is also lucrative. Last year the mobile version of \u201cPUBG\u201d, which has been free to play since 2018, was the second-highest grossing mobile game in the world, generating revenue of $2.1bn, says Sensor Tower, a data firm.

Having failed to crack the game-streaming business with its defunct Stadia platform, Google has repositioned itself to focus on helping developers run live-service games. A live platform needs servers, scalable databases and analytics tools, says Mr Buser.
