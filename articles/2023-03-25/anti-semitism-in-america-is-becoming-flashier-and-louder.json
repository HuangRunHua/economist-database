Stuffed inside were recruitment pamphlets looking for men \u201cof European descent\u201d who wish to see a \u201cbetter future for [their] people\u201d. The pamphlets were distributed by NSC-131, a New England-based neo-Nazi group. Targeting Blackstone was no fluke\u2014the neighbourhood is home to Rhode Island\u2019s largest Jewish population. Adam Greenman, head of a Jewish community centre there, says it is part of a growing trend. According to his office\u2019s tally, anti-Semitic incidents in Rhode Island have more than doubled in the past year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an advocacy group, anti-Semitism is at an all-time high in America. The group recorded about 3,697 hate incidents targeting Jews in 2022, up from 2,717 in 2021. According to ADL\u2019s data, incidents of harassment and vandalism increased last year by 29% and 51% respectively. Assaults also increased by 26%. About 6m American adults identify as Jewish."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One answer for the growing number of incidents is that white supremacist groups have taken online trolling and applied it to the offline world. In 2022 white supremacist groups staged over 40 demonstrations and flash mobs, 25% more than in the previous year and a tenfold increase since 2017. Some groups, such as Goyim Defence League, which ADL describes as \u201ca small network of virulently anti-Semitic provocateurs\u201d founded around 2018, send its members on cross-country tours."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Their numbers may be fairly small, but white supremacists have found an old-fashioned way to seem ubiquitous. Carla Hill, head of ADL\u2019s Centre on Extremism, says white supremacist groups have embraced printed propaganda as the way forward for their movement. In 2017 a handful of groups distributed anti-Semitic pamphlets a few dozen times across 20 states. Last year more than 30 groups spread anti-Semitic messaging 852 times in every state except Hawaii and New Mexico."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A tactical turn came after a violent gathering at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 left one person dead and dozens injured. The rally triggered a split among white supremacists, some of whom thought the violence went too far. \u201cDo you do the openly and blatantly white supremacist in their face? \u2026or do you put it in a more acceptable framing, so that more people will come over to your side and then work at them over time to get them on board?\u201d, Ms Hill says they asked themselves."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Often done under the cover of night, leaflet drops allow perpetrators to remain anonymous. If caught, they may get away with a minor citation for littering or trespassing. As deplorable as it may be, in many cases hate speech is protected by the First Amendment, though some states are trying to find ways to curb it. In New Hampshire the Department of Justice recently brought civil charges against two members of NSC-131 who hung a banner from an overpass reading \u201cKeep New England White\u201d. The argument is the two men trespassed on government property to terrorise people through racial hatred, an offence punishable under the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act. If successful, it would allow prosecutors to pursue criminal charges against the group for future violations."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pamphleteering is now a membership requirement for several groups. The Texas-based Patriot Front, most prolific of the pamphleteers, requires members to do it every week. Ms Hill says some groups have even started working together to spread each other\u2019s propaganda. Patriot Front has softened the tone of its leaflets to mask its horrible ideology, scrubbing white supremacist language and including lines such as \u201cDefend American labour\u201d and \u201cStrong families make strong nations\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The greatest harm, says Ms Hill, comes from online amplification of the stunts, which often get posted on group chats and social-media channels, giving hate groups an outsize impact. \u201cA dozen people or so can do a lot of damage to a community, making them feel like [their presence] is much bigger than it is,\u201d Ms Hill says. That knowledge might offer Providence\u2019s Jewish residents some comfort. \u25a0Correction (March 27th 2023): The original version of this story gave a different picture of the trends in anti-Semitic attacks, based on data from the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s website that were updated on the day our article was published."}], "id": 27}
