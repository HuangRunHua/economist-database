Customers love his chebureki (meat pastries) but have trouble with the digital menus that are ubiquitous in tech-savvy Ukraine. Mr Suleimanov is one of more than a million Ukrainians living in Poland, many of them refugees from Russia\u2019s invasion. Now they are reshaping the country\u2019s high street: since the war started, Ukrainians have opened some 8% of all new sole-proprietor businesses, and the number keeps rising."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230722_EUC896.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 685.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some Ukrainians are piloting new concepts.
