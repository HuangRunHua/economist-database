She knew that her flat in Khortytsky, a district of the city of Zaporizhia, sat inside a potential evacuation zone. But would there really be an explosion? And if so, would she be evacuated? But then came a moment of clarity. Ms Popruha recalled the humiliating experience of being caught behind Russian lines in her family home south of the town of Huliaipole a year ago. That had required a fraught escape with her two children to Zaporizhia. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This time, she would leave before it was too late.

None of this should have any place in a nuclear facility.\u201d In theory, the plant\u2019s design protects against disaster. All its reactors were shut down in September.

Russia could manufacture a serious disaster within less than 24 hours, warns Mr Kotin. \u201cThey could power the reactor up, or reduce the water level in the cooling pools to critically low levels,\u201d he says, creating the conditions for a new chain reaction, with serious consequences. It would be difficult to do this without technical assistance.
