On the morning of June 26th 2021 it hit 38\u00b0C, but Mr Perez still went to work as usual, to try to ensure that the young trees at the nursery where he was employed had enough water to withstand the searing heat. By 3pm the temperature had risen to 41\u00b0C, and Mr Perez had collapsed. A migrant farmworker, he had journeyed to Oregon to make enough money to build his wife Maria a house back in Guatemala. \u201cI promised I would wait for him,\u201d she says, \u201cand now he\u2019s coming home in a box.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe Heat Will Kill You First\u201d, a new book by Jeff Goodell, a longtime climate journalist, reads like an anthology of horror stories. A couple and their one-year-old daughter die of overheating on a hike in northern California. A Parisian woman returns to her flat after a heatwave in 2003 to find her home caked with blood and urine. Her upstairs neighbour had died, and no one found the body for more than a week. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The book is a remarkable exploration of the deadly consequences of rising temperatures wrought by humans pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Unlike wildfires and hurricanes\u2014which create whirls of flame, paint skies an apocalyptic orange and drown cities\u2014heatwaves cannot easily be captured on film. Heat slaughters silently, snuffing out more American lives each year than any other type of weather. \u201cHow do you make visible the story of an invisible killer?\u201d asks Mr Goodell. Some policymakers are trying, by creating new heat-warning systems and naming heatwaves as they do hurricanes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The book\u2019s biggest takeaway is that the harm from heat falls unfairly on those least able to protect themselves. \u201cA heatwave is a predatory event,\u201d writes Mr Goodell, \u201cone that culls out the most vulnerable people.\u201d Rich places and people can plant trees for shade, paint heat-absorbing asphalt to reflect more sunlight, retile zinc roofs, make their cities oases of air-conditioning or move to colder places. But adaptation is much harder for poor people and places. At the end of a chapter devoted to \u201ccheap cold air\u201d, Mr Goodell concludes that \u201cthe most enduring legacy of air-conditioning may be the divide it has created between the cool and the damned.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The book isn\u2019t all fire and brimstone. Unlike some climate-science writers who drown readers in data and seem to write only for other activists, Mr Goodell tells his story colourfully. Readers meet many memorable people working to raise awareness of climate change by figuring out which extreme weather events can be attributed to it, and helping its victims by leaving water for migrants crossing the Arizona desert or campaigning for safer conditions for farmworkers. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The author\u2019s intrepid reporting will make some readers feel lazy. To illustrate the effects of melting sea ice, Mr Goodell faces down polar bears in the Canadian Arctic and crosses a treacherous passage on the way from Chile to Antarctica by boat. In West Texas he scales a rock formation made of the skeletons of ancient sea creatures, which 260m years ago was under water.

A third of Americans live in areas where the government is currently issuing warnings about extreme heat, and Europe looks poised to break previous temperature records. \u201cThe Heat Will Kill You First\u201d could not be more timely. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 73}
