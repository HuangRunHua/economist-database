By Nicole Flattery.

Her role is to listen to tapes and transcribe them, no more. In \u201cNothing Special\u201d, Nicole Flattery, a raucously talented young Irish writer, takes inspiration from the imagined lives of the young women who were never credited but worked on \u201ca, A Novel\u201d (1968), an experimental book the Pop Art supremo compiled from unedited conversations with his stable of muses, whom he called his \u201csuperstars\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Betrayed by her best friend, ostracised by her peers and ignored by most around her, Mae is a lifelong outsider who takes more comfort in objects than people. The Factory, Warhol\u2019s studio, reminds her of a doll\u2019s house, \u201cwith girls arranged everywhere, spread on every surface, lying across the couch, the faded carpets\u201d. Her father is absent, and she lives with her mother, a charming but self-centred waitress with a fondness for booze. A \u201cmoody, prickly girl\u201d, she persistently mistakes cruelty for care and tells a doctor, \u201cI keep doing things that are nothing like the way I want to behave.\u201d Ms Flattery took dead-end jobs, female friendship and power imbalances as themes in \u201cShow Them A Good Time\u201d, her acclaimed short-story collection from 2019, and \u201cNothing Special\u201d ventures into that familiar terrain."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Warhol plays the role of an extra, rather than a lead, in the novel. As is true of many of today\u2019s \u201csuperartists\u201d, such as Jeff Koons (who once had 120 artists working in his studio), Warhol\u2019s work, brilliant as it was, did not emerge from his singular talent. He relied heavily on others\u2019 toil. He appears to Mae in dreams, but she is never introduced to him. When he enters the room, everything brightens as if \u201csuddenly everybody knew exactly where to direct the beam of their attention-seeking\u201d. A spectral figure, he is \u201cvast and untouchable\u201d, but when he speaks to people, they become \u201cmore alive, more human, in that moment\u201d. \u201cNothing Special\u201d expertly captures the hold celebrity artists exert over peons and patrons alike. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Through Mae, Ms Flattery also limns the \u201cinternal disorder\u201d and \u201cgloomy impatience\u201d of adolescence and early adulthood vividly. Like J.D. Salinger\u2019s Holden Caulfield and Sylvia Plath\u2019s Esther Greenwood, Mae is a lonely but memorable character. Friends disappoint her, school is dull, boys are unreachable. Puberty seems \u201cboth boring and disgusting\u201d. Attention is intoxicating but elusive. \u201cIt was so beautiful to be filmed by someone who had loved you,\u201d she says twice in the book, once of her mother, and later, of Edie Sedgwick, Warhol\u2019s tragic addict-muse. With a style like Lorrie Moore\u2019s, Ms Flattery is witty, propulsive and darkly delightful to read. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 74}
