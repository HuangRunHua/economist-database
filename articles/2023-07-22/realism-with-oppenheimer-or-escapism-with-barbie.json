Released on July 21st in America and Britain, the two films will serve as a test of whether viewers can be coaxed off their couches to return to cinemas. The incongruity in the films\u2019 subject and tone has delighted the internet. People have created memes, remixed the trailers into jarring \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d hybrids and debated whether to see the biographical drama or the fantasy comedy first. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The brouhaha is partly a result of the film-makers. Christopher Nolan, the writer-director of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d, is the closest thing Hollywood has to a mad scientist. He shoots on film and mostly eschews computer-generated imagery, blowing up an actual Boeing 747 for a previous film. The nuclear reactions in \u201cOppenheimer\u201d were also created by producing actual explosions (albeit not nuclear ones), brightened by aluminium and magnesium powder. His films toy with narrative conventions and tricksy subjects, such as the unconscious mind and theoretical astrophysics. They have earned a combined total of around $5bn in ticket sales; \u201cDunkirk\u201d, released in 2017, is one of the highest-grossing films ever made about the second world war."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Greta Gerwig, the director and co-writer of \u201cBarbie\u201d, has her own large fan club. She started out in the \u201cmumblecore\u201d genre of independent film (so named for its focus on dialogue) but has since had hits with \u201cLady Bird\u201d (2017) and an adaptation of \u201cLittle Women\u201d (2019). Her work claims humbler gross ticket sales of $300m. For \u201cBarbie\u201d, she has cited old Hollywood musicals and films about the afterlife, such as \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d (1943), as inspiration."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The two films encapsulate some of the caprices of the modern movie industry. \u201cBarbie\u201d is one of many productions to exploit decades-old intellectual property. Mattel, a toymaker, has sold roughly a billion dolls since it first introduced Barbara Millicent Roberts (call her \u201cBarbie\u201d) to consumers in 1959. Ms Robbie, who is also a producer of the film, has said she was drawn to the project because the Barbie name is \u201cmore globally recognised than practically everything else other than Coca-Cola\u201d.

It is a serious, standalone drama\u2014the kind of film made less frequently as studios focus on sequels and spin-offs.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though \u201cOppenheimer\u201d features stars such as Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, the sombre story is not obviously a crowd-pleaser. That it has also been made with a large budget of $100m reflects the faith that studios have in certain film-makers and the risks they allow them to take. \u201cThere have been films previously about the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s and 1950s, and they haven\u2019t been box-office successes,\u201d says Sheldon Hall, a film historian and co-author of the book \u201cEpics, Spectacles and Blockbusters: A Hollywood History\u201d. \u201cThis film is being hinged on Nolan\u2019s reputation,\u201d he adds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d rivalry brings a more serious question for the public: whether to favour realism or escapism. As war rages on in Europe, and countries including China and North Korea continue to develop their nuclear arsenals, the origin story of these weapons of mass destruction may feel too real and raw. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is not a film that will ease viewers\u2019 anxieties. It explores the physicist\u2019s concerns about the horrifying power of his weapon and other bombs; it also shows how the American government attempted to silence him when those opinions became politically unpopular. Oppenheimer has disturbing visions of the bomb\u2019s victims in excruciating pain, their skin peeling. \u201cSome people leave the movie absolutely devastated,\u201d Mr Nolan has said. \u201cThey can\u2019t speak.\u201d"}, {"role": "second", "text": "From Hiroshima to Barbie Land"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Gerwig\u2019s production is much more playful.

History suggests more viewers will opt for escapism. During the Great Depression, many of the highest-grossing films were musicals or historical epics. The same was true during the second world war. Movies that did broach the subject of conflict, including \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d and \u201cSergeant York\u201d, were often set in the past; those that were contemporaneous, such as \u201cCasablanca\u201d, tended to tell love stories rather than tales of grisly combat.
