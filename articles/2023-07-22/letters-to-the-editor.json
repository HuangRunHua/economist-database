Deep-sea mining would see industrial extraction on a far greater scale than anything on land. Modelling suggests that this could affect up to 1.5m square kilometres of the Pacific Ocean\u2019s Clarion Clipperton Zone alone, the first area targeted for mining. It would cause irreversible biodiversity loss on the sea floor where the metal nodules support over 50% of life in the ecosystem. The hydraulic suction process would obliterate the sea floor and substrate and create sediment plumes that could travel at least a thousand kilometres."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The green transition does not require minerals from the deep sea. A 2022 report by SINTEF, a Norwegian research organisation, finds that demand for critical minerals can be reduced by 58% between 2022 and 2050 through a combination of new technology, circular-economy strategies and recycling. And nickel and cobalt are not needed for electric cars. A recent World Bank study concluded that with the rapid evolution in the battery sector, forecasting which technology will be the most used from now until 2050 is nearly impossible. Lithium iron phosphate batteries are already well-established, leaping from 10% of the global EV market share in 2018 to 34% in 2022.

You urge the International Seabed Authority, the UN agency tasked with managing mineral resources in international waters, to finalise rules for mining as soon as possible. As a scientist involved in these policy discussions, I can tell you that there is not nearly enough evidence to ensure effective protection of the marine environment.

Likewise, given that recent battery chemistry R&amp;D is disrupting the demand assumptions for battery metals, the demand for critical minerals from the deep sea may not be as great as you assume. The need for green technologies is indeed urgent, and the costs of both climate change and land-based mining operations are very real. However, assuming that the cost of this destruction in an environment we don\u2019t yet understand will be small is a mistake with permanent consequences for the planet.

As elaborated in my book, \u201cThe Blue Commons\u201d, most of the negotiators of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) were in fact more exercised by the need for a benefit-sharing mechanism that would respect the notion that sea resources were part of the common heritage of mankind, that is, part of the global commons."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1994, the International Seabed Authority (ISA) was set up with a mandate to develop such mechanisms. It has had 28 years to do so and has failed. Moreover, it has moved the proverbial goalposts by now talking of a sharing mechanism based on economic criteria that would undoubtedly favour large technologically advanced countries and a few countries with rich terrestrial mineral resources. That is far from the commons principles that guided the UNCLOS negotiators."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The trouble is that there is now far less likelihood that a sharing mechanism could be devised to obtain full agreement. The ISA has a wretchedly small regular budget, which it has topped up with comparatively large sums from mining companies that pay it for exploration licences. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it has never refused an application and has issued 31 such licences. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The danger today is that countries, such as Nauru, collaborating with mining companies, apply to the ISA to start mining and it produces an opportunistic fudge. This should not be allowed to happen. A sharing mechanism must be established along with a mining code. The scientific community is rightly worried about the environmental dangers.

Your argument for deep-sea mining rests on the mistaken assumption that we have to replace internal-combustion engine cars with electric ones. Instead, we need a more profound transformation of our transport system with a more prominent role for public transport. This would reduce the use of natural resources and leave more space for public parks and cycle tracks. We need a true transformation, not just a little greenwashing of our harmful lifestyle."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dr Katja RietzlerD\u00fcsseldorf"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Society faces uncomfortable decisions over how and from where we source metals for the energy transition. The Economist should be commended for its bravery in coming out in support of collecting deep-sea metal nodules. The seemingly ironic logic of tapping the oceans to protect them has left some people anxious.

You cannot recycle what you don\u2019t have."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Climate change is the greatest threat to our oceans and by saying no to nodules we tacitly accept the alternative: more mines on land. That means more deforestation and more toxicity flooding our oceans, rivers and communities.

This, you say, is because customer bills rise in line with the consumer price index adjusted for housing costs, whereas some of Thames Water\u2019s debt is linked to the (higher) retail price index.

Now that the evidence is shifting in the opposite direction (Free exchange, July 1st), it is worth considering why employees regard remote working as so valuable. As well as a commute-free life, it relates to how employees measure their own well-being, specifically to how they understand their personal identities. Few of us see ourselves as just workers, but define our lives through a constellation of roles; mothers, fathers, care-providers, citizens and so on. Since these identities are more closely associated with how we regard our lives than our ability to excel at our jobs, the new culture of working from home may prove hard to change.
