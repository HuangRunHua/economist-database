The Chinese, they argued, could only resist the West by learning from it\u2014and rejecting their own traditional culture.

Just look at the data, they say. At its independence in 1947, India\u2019s GDP per head was higher than China\u2019s (on a purchasing-power basis). But by the early 1990s, China had moved ahead on that and many other measures. By 2022, their populations were roughly equal but China\u2019s economy was more than three times bigger.

The hope among American and allied officials is that India\u2019s continuing frontier friction with China is pushing it irreversibly into a democratic coalition determined to constrain Chinese power.

India has been drawing closer to America since they signed a civil nuclear co-operation pact in 2008. But their alignment has accelerated since a series of clashes on the Indian frontier with China, including one in 2020 that killed 20 Indian troops and at least four Chinese ones. That was the bloodiest skirmish there since 1967 and brought to an end a three-decade period of relative stability on the border. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "India\u2019s armed forces have since undergone a historic shift of focus away from Pakistan. They have transferred about 70,000 troops as well as fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles to the frontier with China. They have also expanded joint exercises with America and its allies, especially Australia and Japan. America has provided some intelligence and high-altitude training for Indian border forces too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The war in Ukraine has provided another spur. Indian commanders fret about their dependence on Russian arms. India wants to buy advanced American weaponry and to make more in India. In Washington in June the prime minister, Narendra Modi, made progress, with deals to buy armed aerial drones and to jointly manufacture fighter-jet engines in India."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s exact motivations on the border are murky. It may have been responding to recent Indian road-building, which enabled more extensive patrolling, or to frustration at a lack of progress in negotiations on a settlement.

And compromise seems possible. After 18 rounds of talks between military commanders, troops have pulled back from five flashpoints, establishing \u201cbuffer zones\u201d where neither side patrols. Two major flashpoints remain. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "China is pushing for another round of talks and urging India not to let the border issue define the bilateral relationship.

Commerce between China and India was negligible for most of their modern history.

Oppo and Xiaomi are among the bestselling mobile phones."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The border skirmish in 2020 put that all at risk. India banned some 320 Chinese apps, launched tax raids on several Chinese companies and introduced new rules requiring the Indian government\u2019s approval for Chinese investments. Indian officials say they since have rejected 157 relevant applications. And yet bilateral goods trade grew by 43% in 2021 and 8.6% last year. Chinese investment is finding ways in too, sometimes via Singapore. Shein, a Chinese online fashion company whose app was among those banned by India in 2020, is relaunching there soon in partnership with Reliance Industries, India\u2019s biggest private company.

India\u2019s pharmaceutical industry, for instance, relies on China for roughly 70% of its active ingredients."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That does, in theory, make India vulnerable to the kind of economic coercion that China has inflicted on others. But China\u2019s leverage may be waning as it faces an economic slowdown, a shrinking population and an increasingly hostile West. Chinese companies now see India, whose population overtook China\u2019s this year, as an important source of growth, with Goldman Sachs predicting that Indian GDP will be second only to China\u2019s by 2075. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are economic synergies in other areas too. India is the biggest borrower from the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which China set up in 2016 as an alternative to Western-led lending institutions. India is also a member of the Shanghai-based New Development Bank, formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS) in 2015."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hearty economic exchanges are no guarantee against further border bloodshed\u2014or even war. Both countries are led by men who feed off nationalism and historical grievances.

And stabilising the border issue, as was achieved for three decades after Rajiv Gandhi visited China as Indian prime minister in 1988, would leave ample room for co-operation. Both countries want a bigger role in global governance, reject Western criticism on human rights and climate change and share concerns about Islamic extremism. Both refuse to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.
