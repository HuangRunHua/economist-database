A study by the central bank and the UN Development Programme in 2016 estimated that extortion payments added up to 3% of GDP, and the total annual cost of gang violence, including the lost income of people deterred from working or investing, was a staggering 16% of GDP.

More than 71,000 people\u2014a number equivalent to around 7% of male Salvadoreans aged 14-29\u2014have been rounded up and tossed into overcrowded jails.

Trials (which have not yet started) will be concluded within two years, he says.
