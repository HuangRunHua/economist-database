A paper by the Centre for Renewing America, entitled \u201cIt\u2019s time to wage war on transnational drug cartels\u201d, is reported to have caught the attention of Mr Trump, among others. Its author, Ken Cuccinelli, argues that America should be free to take military action in Mexico given that its government does not fully control its territory. Never mind that it would stir deep anti-Americanism, or that treating Mexico like a failed state might turn it into one. \u201cMexico is not a friend. It is complicit in the drug cartels,\u201d says Mr Cuccinelli. \u201cIt\u2019s time to acknowledge that the relationship has changed.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.
