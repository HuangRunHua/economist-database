Or so ruled an American appeals court on July 14th when it threw out another effort by the Federal Trade Commission to block Microsoft\u2019s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a games developer, which a federal judge had cleared three days earlier. A few days later Sony and Microsoft agreed to keep \u201cCall of Duty\u201d, Activision\u2019s hit first-person shooter, on Sony\u2019s PlayStation console, increasing the pressure on Britain\u2019s trustbuster, the last holdout, to approve the merger."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s truce with Sony follows similar agreements with Nintendo, another Japanese gaming company, and Nvidia, an American chipmaker which also owns a cloud-based gaming service. It allays Sony\u2019s fear that it would be cut off from \u201cCall of Duty\u201d, which reportedly generated $1.5bn in revenues for Sony in 2021. However, it is not a clear-cut victory for the PlayStation-maker. Its arrangement with Microsoft is limited to \u201cCall of Duty\u201d, and does not extend to Activision\u2019s other blockbusters, such as World of Warcraft.

In 2023 global spending on mobile games is forecast to hit $125bn, around two-thirds of the industry\u2019s overall revenues, according to Omdia, a research firm. Activision\u2019s popular mobile apps, including Candy Crush and a smartphone version of \u201cCall of Duty\u201d, may enable Microsoft to conquer Asia, Sony\u2019s historic stronghold. It had better, for the company is losing the console wars. Its Xboxes have consistently been outsold by PlayStations. This year Sony is expected to sell 22m PlayStation 5s, twice the forecast for the Xbox. Whether mobile supremacy is worth the $69bn price tag is another matter. Giant deals often destroy value in a way that puts the most trigger-happy \u201cCall of Duty\u201d pros to shame."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The biggest winners from the deal, besides Activision shareholders, may be other game developers, such as Take Two and Electronic Arts. Their popular franchises, Grand Theft Auto and FIFA, respectively, make the companies ripe targets for acquisition, which Microsoft\u2019s regulatory success makes less likely to be challenged. Share prices across the industry have been rising since the American ruling, possibly in anticipation of a takeover spree. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 59}
