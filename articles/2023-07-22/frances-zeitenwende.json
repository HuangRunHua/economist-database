The German chancellor\u2019s promise to invest heavily in defence, though haltingly implemented, marked an abrupt change. Far less noticed is an equally arresting shift taking place in France. The implications of its turning point for Europe could be just as significant."}, {"role": "body", "text": "France\u2019s tournant historique consists of a double inflection point. Each touches a fundamental precept. One is Ukraine\u2019s membership of NATO. The other is the enlargement of the EU\u2019s borders to the east and south. France, once sceptical about welcoming newcomers to either group, has quietly become an advocate for both."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was in the run-up to the NATO summit in July in Vilnius, Lithuania\u2019s capital, that many of France\u2019s astonished allies first grasped its new approach. France lined up beside Britain, Poland and the Baltic states, arguing for a fast track into the alliance for Ukraine after the war. \u201cWe need a path towards membership,\u201d Emmanuel Macron, the French president, declared in Bratislava, Slovakia\u2019s capital, on May 31st. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This set France apart from not only Germany but America, \u201cto the apparent surprise of the Biden administration\u201d, noted Daniel Fried, an American ex-diplomat. In 2008 France and Germany blocked Ukraine from immediate membership of the alliance. Four years ago Mr Macron told The Economist that NATO was experiencing \u201cbrain death\u201d. Even after Russia sent in the tanks, Mr Macron at times seemed as worried about its future security as about Ukraine\u2019s. Yet Europe\u2019s eastern flank has found an unexpected new champion."}, {"role": "body", "text": "France\u2019s second shift, on EU enlargement, is less visible. A decision on whether to open membership negotiations with Ukraine (and Moldova) is not due until December 2023, after an initial discussion in October. But talks are well under way, not least because such an expansion would require complex changes to the rules governing the EU\u2019s internal organisation. A Franco-German working group is looking at the implications. The European Commission will report back in October on enlargement, including to the Western Balkans. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "France has traditionally been wary of enlargement, regarding expansion as a threat to its preferred strategy of \u201cdeepening\u201d the union and forging a political project. Britain, when still a member, was an arch-enlarger, and thus viewed with suspicion in Paris for seeking to turn Europe into a mere trading zone. In 2019 France vetoed the opening of membership talks with Albania and North Macedonia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s war has transformed Mr Macron\u2019s approach. Last year his diplomats worked hard to secure support for the EU\u2019s decision to grant Ukraine candidate status. France lifted its veto on the bids by Albania and North Macedonia, enabling membership negotiations to begin. The warmth of Mr Macron\u2019s speech in Bratislava dazed central and eastern Europeans, long favourable to a broader EU. \u201cThe question for us is not whether we should enlarge,\u201d he declared, \u201cbut how we should do it.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many observers remain sceptical. \u201cIt was a free lunch for Macron to back Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership,\u201d argues a European diplomat, noting that France knew full well that the Americans would put on the brakes. The tactical interest for Mr Macron in standing up for central and eastern Europe is plain, after the credibility he lost last year over his outreach to Vladimir Putin. France\u2019s line on NATO was partly tactical too: a robust message to Russia, it argued, would strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in any future peace negotiations."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet there are reasons to think that this double French shift reflects a geopolitical reassessment. Mr Macron, pro-European to the core, has long been preoccupied by the need to fortify what he calls \u201cEuropean sovereignty\u201d: the continent\u2019s capacity to determine its future amidst great-power rivalry. This concern is accentuated both by the existential threat to Europe of an expansionist Russia, and by the possibility that an America led by Donald Trump, should he win next year\u2019s election, would be less committed to European security. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "France\u2019s conclusion is that Europe \u201ccan no longer accept \u2018grey zones\u2019 between the EU and Russia\u201d, says an official. Unless countries on the fringes are anchored inside the EU or NATO, they will be vulnerable to autocratic powers. The last phase of enlargement happened \u201cwhen we thought that liberal democracy would spread and become the dominant model\u201d, says Laurence Boone, France\u2019s Europe minister: \u201cToday that\u2019s not the case. So we need to move to a geopolitical construction.\u201d Enlargement becomes a tool for consolidating European sovereignty. And a wider EU is not an alternative to a deeper political project, but a means of achieving it. \u201cThis really is a structural shift,\u201d argues Benjamin Haddad, one of Mr Macron\u2019s deputies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "None of this means that enlargement will happen any time soon. Membership talks are proceeding grindingly slowly with four Western Balkan countries; Montenegro\u2019s began over a decade ago. Absorbing Ukraine would be complex, long and fraught. But it is now viewed in Paris as a geopolitical imperative. Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, expects EU leaders to open membership talks in December. France alone cannot dictate the choices of the 27-member club. But it remains a forceful guide to those decisions. Its Zeitenwende could be crucial to determining the future shape of Europe. \u25a0"}], "id": 36}
