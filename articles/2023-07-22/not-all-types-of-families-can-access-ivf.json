"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Restrictions on the use of assisted reproduction by same-sex couples and single women have been loosened across much of the West. But the liberalising trend is far from universal. A number of European countries, including the Czech Republic and Italy, still allow access only to heterosexual couples. A recent survey of changes to regulations concerning sexuality and IVF in 18 countries by the International Federation of Fertility Societies (IFFS) found that in 2018-21 five increased access for same-sex couples and six decreased it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Japan, where subsidies for IVF are being enacted as a response to demographic change, parliament is discussing a law that would determine who is eligible for treatment. The outcome could limit treatment to married couples, which would exclude gay couples: an interest in more children does not necessarily trump concerns about what sort of families there should be. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such concerns are clearly seen when it comes to freezing eggs, something 35% of countries surveyed by the IFfS forbid. In China, which is one of them, eggs are to be used now, in existing relationships.

Erika Wang, a 33-year-old from Zhejiang province, recently had her eggs frozen in California at her Singapore-based employer\u2019s expense. She has posted about her decision on social media. \u201cFertility technology is a great invention for feminism, especially Asian feminism,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to show my friends and peers that this is possible.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some countries allow only women with a medical reason for freezing their eggs to do so; others require that frozen eggs, like fresh eggs, be used only in the context of a heterosexual marriage, or only in the wombs of women below a certain age.

Two European countries allow neither egg donation nor sperm donation; three more allow sperm donation but not egg donation. Embryo donation is banned in 14. Eleven European countries do not allow pre-implantation genetic testing for any \u201cnon-medical\u201d reasons; most of Europe strictly forbids its use for sex selection. In places where such selection is tolerated, which include America, Mexico, Northern Cyprus and Ukraine, this ability to choose constitutes something of a selling-point.\u25a0"}], "id": 50}
