It smells like cheese. It tastes like cheese (specifically mature cheddar). And it is cheese\u2014at least under the microscope. \u201cSynthetic dairy\u201d is made with the same ingredients as the conventional sort. But instead of getting the main ingredient from a live ruminant, Better Dairy, a three-year-old British cheesemaker, derives some of it from yeast. These microbes are fed sugar, which they then convert into milk proteins in a process which is similar to brewing.

Plant-based beverages made from things like soyabeans, almonds and oats make up 15% of all milk sales by value in America and 11% in western Europe, reckons the Good Food Institute (GFI), a think-tank. Yet lovers of real dairy, which plant-derived products cannot quite mimic, still need cows, goats and ewes. \u201cPrecision fermentation\u201d companies like Better Dairy hope to change that\u2014and take a fat slice of the $900bn global dairy market. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Remilk, an Israeli startup, has recently received approval to sell its fare in America, Israel and Singapore. Perfect Day, a Californian one, already sells synthetic milk, ice cream and cream cheese. It recently signed contracts to sell its proteins to Nestl\u00e9, a food giant, and to Starbucks. In its latest funding round two years ago it raised $350m, valuing it at $1.6bn. All told, precision fermenters have raised nearly $3bn from investors since the start of 2021.

Lactose, to which some people are allergic, and hormones, which have been linked to some adult diseases, can be stripped out. Fermentation tanks do not need to be pumped full of antibiotics and can be set up anywhere\u2014handy at a time of rising worries about food security and climate change. The process uses less water and, because it requires less energy and less land, emits fewer greenhouse gases than conventional dairy production, which is responsible for more than 3% of annual planet-warming emissions, almost twice as much as aviation (and a lot of it from belchy cows)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One challenge for the innovators is winning consumers\u2019 trust. Steel tanks lack the familiarity of cows. A quarter of respondents to a survey in America aren\u2019t keen to try \u201cprecision-fermented\u201d fare (which may explain why producers prefer to call it \u201canimal-free\u201d). Regulators create hurdles, too. Although the startups are confident they will get the green light\u2014the technique is already used for flavourings and insulin\u2014they worry about the time this will take and about labelling disputes. According to GFI, even in America, the land of free enterprise, it takes about nine months.

For now Better Dairy\u2019s cheddar still uses bovine casein, one of the proteins in milk; the firm is working on a synthetic version that would make its cheese properly vegan. And the process remains costly. A fermenter that can hold about 30 litres of milk can cost \u00a3150,000 ($190,000).
