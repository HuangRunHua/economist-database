He demanded \u201ccritical reports with accurate facts and objective analysis\u201d. But he also told the journalists that they must \u201clove and protect the Communist Party\u201d. He did not explain what they should do if one instruction conflicted with the other.

One hour-long tutorial is titled \u201cEnsure that the politicians run the papers, the magazines, the TV stations and the news websites\u201d. Another talks about how to \u201ccorrectly guide public opinion\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like a drumbeat,\u201d says David Bandurski of the China Media Project, a research programme in America. \u201cThey want to remind them that the party is in control.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "China locks up more journalists than any other country. But the training app is one of many softer forms of coercion. Since 2014 all reporters have had to pass an exam to get a press card.

One former journalist failed the exam on her first try because she forgot the meaning of \u201cthe four great things\u201d, one of Mr Xi\u2019s impenetrable nationalist slogans.

In 2008 candid reports about a devastating earthquake in the south-western province of Sichuan laid bare the failings of local officials.
