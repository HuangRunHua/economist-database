They called the rules they came up with the \u201cfour I\u2019s\u201d. A journal should be immediate\u2014no rewriting history at a later date. It must be indiscreet; nothing is duller than a diary that dutifully keeps secrets. It should be intimate, exposing the diarist\u2019s quirks and habits to foster a close relationship with the reader. Finally it should be made indecipherable to the diarist\u2019s contemporaries, perhaps with bad handwriting or codenames. Let posterity enjoy its indiscretions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A widely accepted maxim is that the best political diarists toil in the foothills of power. (Chris Mullin, a Labour MP, entitled his diaries \u201cA View from the Foothills\u201d.) If diarists were climbing to or occupying the summit they would have little time or energy left for late-night scribbling. The 1930s were the heyday of two fine examples of this type: Henry \u201cChips\u201d Channon and Harold Nicolson. Both were junior ministers, and among the wittiest, most elegant chroniclers of goings-on in Whitehall and the drawing rooms of Belgravia. (Nazi luminaries beguiled Channon before the war.) Prime ministers have also turned out decent diaries. William Gladstone\u2019s many volumes were a comprehensive portrait of society and politics in Victorian England. Harold Macmillan was an acute observer of people and events, when he wasn\u2019t reading his beloved Trollope. Here are five of the best political diaries, presented in ascending order of greatness.

Out of print"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hugh Dalton was minister of economic warfare in Winston Churchill\u2019s wartime coalition government, best known for his stewardship of the Special Operations Executive, an espionage outfit. According to his biographer, Ben Pimlott, this prickly, patrician Labour politician used his diary as a \u201ccompanion, a sounding board for ideas, perhaps most of all an emotional release\u201d. Dalton\u2019s waspish portraits of his fellow cabinet members stand out, but it is his entry for Tuesday May 28th 1940 that lives longest in the memory. This was his account of Churchill\u2019s passionate address to his \u201couter\u201d cabinet in a packed room at the House of Commons. He was seeking their support in his dispute within the war cabinet with Lord Halifax, the appeasement-minded foreign minister. Dalton\u2019s vivid account was the basis of a scintillating scene in the film \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d, which starred Gary Oldman as Churchill."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dalton greatly admired Churchill, his political foe, and recorded his thrilling peroration that evening: \u201cWe shall go on and we shall fight it out, here or elsewhere, and if this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Against the Tide: Diaries, 1973-77. By Tony Benn. Cornerstone; 768 pages; \u00a39.99"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gladstone excepted, no diarist was more prolific than Anthony Wedgwood (Tony) Benn. The former Lord Stansgate started keeping a diary at the age of 15 during the second world war. He published nine volumes over 73 years. Of greatest interest is his depiction of the fierce policy battles and personal feuds within the Labour cabinets of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s. Benn, a standard bearer for the far left, had a grandstand seat for those exchanges, first as secretary of state for industry, then for energy. These were the years of trade-union power and the three-day week, when Britain was branded \u201cthe sick man of Europe\u201d. Usually around midnight Benn would sit down in his study and recount his day\u2019s struggles into his cassette recorder, leaving others to transcribe the tapes. The narrative rarely slackens and the detail of meetings and conversations is quite remarkable. Benn would always tell journalists, a little pompously, that his interest lay in political argument, not in personalities. Yet there are plenty of colourful vignettes of both colleagues and rivals. Benn aimed his harshest criticism at people like Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock, who should have been his allies on the left of the party."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Alastair Campbell Diaries Volume 2: Power And The People 1997\u20131999. By Alastair Campbell. Hutchinson; 800 pages; \u00a335"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Benn would have found his pretence that personalities don\u2019t matter harder to sustain in the next Labour government, which came to office in 1997 after an 18-year wait. The relationship between the prime minister, Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown, his chancellor of the exchequer, was fraught. Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair\u2019s spin doctor, captures its epic bitterness. Mr Campbell had been a tabloid journalist (he was political editor of the Daily Mirror). His spare, exciting prose, together with his brutal honesty, vivifies this enthralling story. Mr Blair and Mr Brown were like two medieval knights with loyal retinues. Mr Campbell was in Mr Blair\u2019s (although he also tried to mediate between them). Because of his role at Number 10 he was uniquely placed to observe the rivalry, scheming and mistrust at the heart of the New Labour project. The Campbell diaries are a dramatic account of day-by-day\u2014often hour-by-hour\u2014life inside Number 10, where the pace of events was relentless, friction with the media was constant and relationships among advisers were intense, and often characterised by machismo.

Clark was a real stylist, and is by turns amusing, gloomy, vituperative and as indiscreet about people and events in Westminster as he and Mr Brandreth agreed a diarist must be. The elder son of Kenneth Clark, an art historian (who made the landmark television series \u201cCivilisation\u201d), he honed his writing as a military historian. \u201cThe Donkeys\u201d was his controversial analysis of the quality of leadership by British generals during the first world war.

The Colville diaries are an absorbing, behind-the-scenes portrayal of the great man and his inner circle, as well as a remarkably perceptive analysis of the state of the war. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "John (always known as \u201cJock\u201d) Colville was well connected. His mother was a woman of the bedchamber to Queen Mary. He was just 24 when he became one of Neville Chamberlain\u2019s private secretaries. When Churchill replaced Chamberlain as prime minister in May 1940, Colville was at first dismayed that an \u201cadventurer\u201d now had charge of the country\u2019s fate. But he was soon under Churchill\u2019s spell, and his growing admiration for his master\u2019s skills is clear to see. Colville was an especially sharp observer of Churchill\u2019s skilful wooing of Franklin Roosevelt and his emissary Harry Hopkins; the prime minister desperately wanted to bring isolationist America into the war. Colville would lock his diary in his writing table in Downing Street, but became so worried it might be discovered that he moved it to the family home in Staffordshire. Merely keeping a diary could have led to charges against him under the Official Secrets Act. But Churchill, for whom he was like a second son, would of course never have countenanced that."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Also try"}, {"role": "body", "text": "British political diarists appear often in The Economist\u2019s pages.
