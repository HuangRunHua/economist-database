The previous month he had suspended another fine imposed on J&amp;F, which owns the world\u2019s biggest meatpacking company, JBS. The companies had agreed to the fines as part of leniency agreements in which their executives admitted to bribing Brazilian officials. Mr Toffoli ruled that there was reasonable doubt about whether the agreements were signed voluntarily, and argued that the judge who administered the fines may have colluded with prosecutors."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The fines came after a series of Brazilian corruption investigations, the most famous of which, known as Lava Jato (Car Wash), started ten years ago this month. It was part of a wave of anti-corruption activity which swept Latin America in the 2010s. But Mr Toffoli\u2019s decisions correspond with a new worsening of perceptions of corruption across the region. Brazil fell ten places in an annual index of perceived corruption released by Transparency International, a charity, in January. Peru fell 20 places, putting it among the countries perceived to be the most corrupt in the world. Most Latin American countries scored worse than their levels of development suggest they should (see chart 1)."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240309_AMC666.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 814.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Perceptions are not always reliable, but there is other evidence of a backlash against anti-corruption efforts. In November allies of Honduras\u2019s new president bypassed congress to name an attorney general who is friendly to the ruling party.

Brazilian police started investigating Petrobras, the state oil firm, in March 2014. It had been doling out building contracts at inflated prices for years. Companies used the extra cash to bribe oil executives and officials. The investigation spun off into a dozen others, focused on construction firms. Between 2001 and 2016 Odebrecht paid almost $800m in bribes across three continents, gleaning over $3bn in profits for itself and its conspirators. It is the largest foreign graft case ever prosecuted by the US Department of Justice (see chart 2), which had jurisdiction because some bribes were funnelled through bank accounts in the United States."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Crime and punishment"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The investigation was dubbed Lava Jato because its starting point was the examination of a car wash which was laundering money. It became perhaps the biggest investigation into graft since Italy\u2019s Mani Pulite (Clean Hands) in the 1990s, and upended politics across Latin America. Almost a third of Brazil\u2019s senators and nearly half of its governors were drawn in to some extent. The left-wing president at the time, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached in 2016. Her mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (known as Lula), who was president between 2003 and 2010, was twice sentenced to jail (he was released after 580 days). Both cases were linked to Lava Jato.

The revenues of several implicated construction firms tanked in its wake. Some went bankrupt.

For a while it seemed nobody could escape Lava Jato\u2019s crime-busting tentacles."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then came the fall. Errors and hubristic behaviour by zealous prosecutors cast doubt on the investigation\u2019s impartiality. The most prominent Lava Jato judge, Sergio Moro, publicised a plea bargain which implicated Lula one week before the 2018 election. Lula\u2019s favoured candidate lost to Jair Bolsonaro, a hard-right populist whose campaign had been boosted by anti-establishment sentiment generated by Lava Jato. Mr Moro then left the judiciary to become Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s justice minister. The lead prosecutor, Deltan Dallagnol, became a congressman for a right-wing party. In 2019 leaked text messages published by The Intercept, an investigative site, suggested that Mr Moro had been colluding on cases with Mr Dallagnol. Both men told The Economist there was no collusion, and pointed out that the majority of judicial decisions on Lava Jato were initially upheld on appeal. Mr Dallagnol said the task force did not recognise the authenticity of the leaked messages, Mr Moro that they had \u201cnever been examined in open court\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Critics also accused the Lava Jato task-force of using aggressive tactics to court media attention. Lula was arrested in 2016 using a bench warrant, usually used when a subpoenaed person refuses to attend a hearing, something he had not done. In Peru and Brazil, prosecutors were criticised for the extensive use of pre-trial detention. One Brazilian investigator forbade the rector of a university from entering his campus, and briefly imprisoned him on suspicion of corruption. The rector committed suicide soon after. He was innocent."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Politicians pounced on these cracks. \u201cLava Jato was like the Jacobin moment of the French Revolution,\u201d says Marco Bastos of Southern Pulse, a consultancy.

Then the old guard struck back."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Dying light"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Legislators may have ousted Ms Rousseff because they felt she was doing too little to protect them.

His decree claimed that this could curb the \u201cexponential growth of the prison population\u201d. In 2019 the Supreme Court reversed an earlier decision and ruled that defendants be allowed to exhaust all avenues for appeal before being jailed. That freed Lula and protected many politicians from prison. Congress passed a law criminalising \u201cabuses\u201d by prosecutors and judges in the same year, with a broad definition of abuse."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Temer\u2019s successor, Mr Bolsonaro, had his own reasons to break with Lava Jato, despite having ridden the wave of sentiment it created to power. He appointed an attorney general who threw out over 100 requests to investigate Mr Bolsonaro. In 2020, when Lava Jato began scrutinising one of his sons, who is also a politician, Mr Bolsonaro was swift to declare that \u201cthere is no more corruption in government.\u201d (His son denies wrongdoing, and calls the investigations \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d.) He disbanded the Lava Jato task force in 2021. Central America\u2019s anti-corruption crusaders met a similar fate. Internationally backed courts in Honduras and Guatemala were both closed by politicians."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Toffoli\u2019s recent decisions show that the backlash against anti-corruption efforts continues. The judge himself has been linked to Lava Jato. In 2019 Cruso\u00e9, a Brazilian investigative outlet, published an article about emails sent by Odebrecht\u2019s boss in 2007 which referred to Mr Toffoli, then the attorney general, as \u201cthe friend of my father\u2019s friend\u201d. The article alleged that \u201cmy father\u2019s friend\u201d was a reference to Lula, who was president at the time. He appointed Mr Toffoli to the Supreme Court in 2009. After the story was published, the Supreme Court deemed the article \u201cfake news\u201d and ordered it be scrubbed from the internet. Only public outcry forced the decision to be reversed. Along with suspending fines to be paid by Odebrecht and J&amp;F, Mr Toffoli has also annulled all evidence gathered in Odebrecht\u2019s leniency agreement. He declined to comment.

Mr Moro, now a senator, faces two trials which could bar him from office. One, concerning alleged campaign-finance abuses, was filed by Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s party. The other, which alleges that Mr Moro committed fraud as part of an old plea deal, was launched by Mr Toffoli. Mr Dallagnol lost his seat in Congress after a decision by an electoral court on a technicality. He notes that the deciding judge was himself investigated by Lava Jato, and that lower courts had ruled in his favour. Mr Moro says both accusations against him are baseless."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On February 26th a different judge on Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court authorised companies that had signed leniency agreements during Lava Jato to renegotiate the terms.
