Investors in America have spent years secretly buying land for a new city in California.

Even Donald Trump, in his bid for re-election, has proposed ten \u201cfreedom cities\u201d. In their early stages, many of these projects will attract derision.

Edward Glaeser of Harvard University has lauded cities as mankind\u2019s greatest invention. He notes that agglomerations of money and talent make societies richer, smarter and greener. Since companies move closer to their customers and people closer to their jobs, growing cities beget economic growth. Economists think that doubling a city\u2019s population provides a boost to productivity of 2-5%.

The problem will worsen as urban areas swell by an extra 2.5bn inhabitants by 2050, according to projections by the United Nations, with the new urbanites appearing in regions where cities are already under extreme stress. Builders hope that new metropolises will help relieve the pressure. In Nairobi, near where Stephen Jennings, a former private-equity boss, is building a new city called Tatu, public-transport commutes run to over an hour for most jobs. Construction is progressing nicely in Kenya\u2019s newest settlement, where 5,000 residents already live and work in a gated village.

The push for a new town outside San Francisco\u2014a project that goes by the label of \u201cCalifornia Forever\u201d\u2014came from an \u201cepic housing shortage\u201d on America\u2019s west coast, says Jan Sramek, who leads a group of Silicon Valley investors making it happen. The group, which includes Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve\u2019s widow; Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn; and Sir Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist, will put their plans for \u201chomes, jobs and clean energy\u201d to a public vote in November. If approved, the city will house up to 400,000 residents on 60,000 acres of what is now farmland.

Today\u2019s city-builders have decided that walkability\u2014or what is sometimes called a \u201c15-minute city\u201d\u2014is a crucial selling point. Some, like Dholera in India and Bill Gates\u2019s Belmont in Arizona, are pitching so-called \u201csmart cities\u201d, which use sensors to direct residents away from traffic or tell them the most environmentally friendly time for a shower.

Mr Lore\u2019s Telosa city (adapted from the Greek word for \u201chighest purpose\u201d) will do away with private ownership of land, which will instead be held in a communal trust, with money generated from leasing it spent on public services. Praxis (another Greek word, meaning \u201ctheory in practice\u201d) has raised $19m and collected a waiting list of potential residents who want to \u201ccreate a more vital future for humanity\u201d in the Mediterranean.

As Mr Jennings puts it, the crucial thing is to focus on getting the \u201cboring stuff\u201d, such as roads and sewerage, right in order to create a city that is walkable and green, but not especially smart. In addition to being what he calls \u201ca dumb city\u201d, Mr Sramek\u2019s California Forever shares another advantage with Tatu: both will piggy-back on neighbouring economies. \u201cWe are five miles away from cities on both sides,\u201d says the Californian developer. \u201cThe strength of the demand makes a big difference to how fast you can grow.\u201d In Britain, Milton Keynes\u2014a city established in the 1960s, less than an hour by train from London\u2014is thriving. Reston, a planned town outside Washington, DC, is another success. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sensible city-builders are wary of taking on debt. Developers have instead started to sell stakes in projects, demonstrating buy-in for what are long-term ventures. \u201cYou are looking at a 50-year time horizon,\u201d says Mr Jennings, who admits that it \u201csounds insane\u201d. He has tapped friends for capital, avoiding private-equity backers and their investment horizons, which normally come in at under a decade. California Forever is entirely funded by equity investments. If the two new settlements succeed, their investors will be rewarded. But so will many others.
