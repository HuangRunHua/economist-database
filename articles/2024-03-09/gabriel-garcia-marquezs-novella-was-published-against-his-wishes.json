By Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. Translated by Anne McLean. Knopf; 144 pages; $22. Viking; \u00a316.99"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A seemingly happily married, middle-aged woman, Ana Magdalena Bach, makes an annual pilgrimage to an offshore island to lay a bunch of gladioli on her mother\u2019s grave. She does this every year on August 16th, staying on the island for only one night and following the same routine, until one year she meets a stranger in the hotel bar and goes to bed with him. This, in turn, becomes a routine, with a different, random man each year, a ritual that begins as controlled but turns her inner life upside down."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She comes to realise that her marriage was sustained \u201cby a conventional happiness that avoided disagreements in order not to stumble over them, the way people hide dirt under the rug\u201d. Her husband, too, has been unfaithful, she discovers, but they stay together. It sounds like a conventional plot, but this slim novella is by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, the Colombian Nobel laureate (pictured). It has been published\u2014against his express request\u2014to mark the tenth anniversary of his death. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "An act of defiance of a dead person\u2019s wishes happens to appear at the end of the novella. But is it justified in life? In a brief preface, the author\u2019s two sons recall that their father\u2019s judgment, as he declined into dementia, was: \u201cThis book doesn\u2019t work. It must be destroyed.\u201d Confessing \u201can act of betrayal\u201d in deciding to publish it, they speculate that just as their father\u2019s decline prevented him finishing the book, so it may also have prevented him realising how good it was. Are they right?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The master\u2019s voice can certainly be heard in \u201cUntil August\u201d. Unusually for Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s works of fiction, it is set in the present. The unidentified place is the Colombian Caribbean as nobody else can conjure it, with its blue herons, palm-fringed lagoons, squalor and sensuality, and the sea, sometimes sleepy, sometimes terrifying. (It is also the setting of his greatest works: \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude\u201d and \u201cLove in the Time of Cholera\u201d.) It is a world peopled by silver-haired dandies in white linen suits and imperiously beautiful women crooning bolero. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Music occupies a central place in Latin American life, as it does in both \u201cUntil August\u201d and, by a curious coincidence, in the latest novel by Mario Vargas Llosa, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s friend (until they fell out), who also won the literature Nobel. Mr Vargas Llosa, who is 87, has said that \u201cLe Dedico Mi Silencio\u201d (\u201cI Give You My Silence\u201d) will be his last book. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez sketches the complicated complicities and compulsions of love and sex, his favourite subject matter. With his precise, vivid prose, beautifully translated into English, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez creates an atmosphere as few other writers can. But here he does not do as much with it as he might have in his prime. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez worked intermittently on the text of \u201cUntil August\u201d, which was originally conceived as a long novel, over many years. He published two fragments in magazines. But despite several drafts, he was unable to finish the slimmed-down story to his satisfaction before he died."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whether a dead author\u2019s wishes regarding unpublished material should always be respected is a vexed question. Few today would quibble with the decision of Max Brod, Franz Kafka\u2019s friend and literary executor, to publish \u201cThe Trial\u201d and \u201cThe Castle\u201d against the writer\u2019s instructions. More questionable were the actions of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s publishers in marketing four works assembled from unfinished material, some many years after the author\u2019s death. \u201cYou think something is in shape to be published or you don\u2019t, and Hemingway didn\u2019t,\u201d complained Joan Didion, an American writer, speaking for many creators."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s Spanish editor, Crist\u00f3bal Pera, claims to have hewed closely to the original, approaching it as a \u201crestorer facing a great master\u2019s canvas\u201d. Diehard fans will rejoice at this posthumous bonus track. But others will find it hard to banish a slight queasiness\u2014much as Ana Magdalena Bach felt on the return ferry from the island\u2014at the commercial opportunism surrounding its publication. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 70}
