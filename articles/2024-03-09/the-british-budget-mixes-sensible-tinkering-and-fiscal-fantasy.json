Voters reckon Labour is the better party at managing the economy (see chart). According to Ipsos, Rishi Sunak has a personal approval rating of -54, the worst recorded for a prime minister (including the benighted Liz Truss) since Sir John Major in 1994.

Would he scrape together a package of tax giveaways, based on dubious fiscal assumptions, to give the party a fighting chance at the next election? Or, with the prospects of re-election diminishing, would he make legacy-burnishing reforms that removed some of the distortions in Britain\u2019s tax and welfare regimes? In the end, he tried to do both. But some sensible tinkering cannot mask the fictions that underpin the government\u2019s plans. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One fiction concerns spending plans. Mr Hunt emphasised his promise to maintain 1% real-terms growth in day-to-day spending on public services from 2025 onward. But because budgets in some departments, like health, education and defence, are protected, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the fiscal watchdog, reckons this commitment translates into cuts of 2.3% elsewhere in government. Only through an implausible bout of austerity to pared-back public services does Mr Hunt meet his rule that public debt start falling relative to GDP within five years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The fiscal rules are not pure fantasy. The \u201cheadroom\u201d available to Mr Hunt prior to this week\u2019s budget had fallen marginally, from \u00a313bn ($17bn) in November to \u00a312.2bn. As a result the budget\u2019s big giveaway\u2014a cut to national insurance, a payroll tax, worth \u00a311bn\u2014had to be part-funded by a list of smaller revenue-raising measures rather than only by more borrowing. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But his remaining headroom, of just \u00a38.9bn, is a make-believe kind of cushion: chancellors since 2010 have averaged \u00a326bn. The revenue-raisers mostly take effect well after the spending they are meant to offset. In 2024-25, for instance, the budget\u2019s tax-cutting measures will cost \u00a314bn but the tax-raising measures will raise only \u00a30.4bn. And the OBR is obliged to take at face value the chancellor\u2019s claim that freezes on fuel duties are temporary when they have not budged for more than a decade."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Within this tapestry of fiscal fiction, Mr Hunt did weave in a handful of useful reforms. National insurance is a better target for cuts than income tax. It applies only to income from work, not from sources like savings or pensions. That may marginally improve the labour supply.

The longer-term aspiration to equalise tax treatment for families regardless of how earnings are divided between parents is also a good one. For businesses, plans to extend permanent full expensing to leased equipment should improve incentives to invest. Changing the \u201cnon-dom\u201d regime, a tax shelter for rich foreigners, is also sensible. The new plans, for clearer residency-based rules, bring Britain more in line with global norms. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A productivity plan for the National Health Service (NHS) is welcome in theory. The NHS definitely needs staff who are more productive, not just more staff. Less clear is whether budgets for capital spending and \u201cdigital transformation\u201d will be ring-fenced: both have been raided in the past to cope with strikes and winter crises. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Creating a \u201cBritish ISA\u201d that permits an additional tax-free \u00a35,000 in investments in British-listed equities (on top of the \u00a320,000 allowance already available to savers) is unlikely to quickly improve the poor recent performance of domestic shares. Despite Mr Hunt\u2019s claim that Britain is \u201con track to become the world\u2019s next Silicon Valley\u201d, the more significant millstone around the public markets is that companies listed in Britain are over-represented in mature, low-growth industries like energy and financial services. A de facto increase in the ISA threshold, which had not risen in line with recent inflation, is a good thing, even if the requirement to buy British smacks of protectionism."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other changes are more foolish. The chancellor increased the revenue threshold for firms to pay VAT from \u00a385,000 to \u00a390,000. It would have been better to lower it: Britain\u2019s VAT threshold is unusually high and incentivises businesses to avoid expansion (or to misreport sales) rather than be forced to grapple with the tax."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The budget is not likely to change the government\u2019s electoral prospects greatly. Its overall record on income taxes is decidedly ambiguous: according to the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, the net impact is to slightly lower taxes for those earning between \u00a326,000 and \u00a360,000 a year and, because of freezes to income-tax thresholds, to slightly increase them for everyone else. Chatter has already begun about yet another fiscal event in June if forecasts move in the government\u2019s favour. As inflation falls, gilt yields and thus government borrowing costs could drop; there is still time for a pre-election bonanza."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But even if Mr Hunt has not changed Tory fortunes, he has made life more difficult for Labour. Ms Reeves has so far adopted a strategy of sticking to the government\u2019s tax-and-spending plans while endorsing a small number of tax raids on popular targets. Reforming non-dom treatment was one such tax rise: Labour had set aside the proceeds for increasing the number of family-doctor and dental appointments, among other things. If it does not reverse the national-insurance cut and does not want to see taxes increase on \u201cworking people\u201d, its promises to improve straining public services become more fantastical."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That may not matter for the campaign, which the Labour Party would like to be a referendum on what it terms \u201c14 years of economic failure\u201d. But it will matter if the opposition makes it into office. Some of Mr Hunt\u2019s assumptions may be fiscal fictions; the same increasingly goes for Labour. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
