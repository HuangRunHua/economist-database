In 1992 its debt-to-GDP ratio was 27%, rising to 42% in 1997 and 100% now. Debt levels are at or near record levels in France, Italy, Spain and America. In contrast, debt has been broadly stable in Germany and the Netherlands, and has fallen for 25 years in Sweden. All of these countries have fiscal rules\u2014so fiscal rules do not guarantee good fiscal outcomes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A lot comes down to electorates. In Germany politicians believe that playing fast and loose with public finances will not win elections. That is not true in Britain. British governments therefore invent fiscal rules, and try to get around them. The Labour government of Tony Blair used the Private Finance Initiative, while the Conservatives have a one-year petrol-duty freeze that has now lasted 14 years. By pretending the freeze will end, the government claims to have a credible medium-term fiscal position even though everyone knows that this is a nonsense. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The current rules require the government to hit borrowing and debt targets in five years\u2019 time. Because the target is rolling, the deadline can be constantly moved back, allowing implausible spending cuts or tax rises to satisfy the rule. The opposition Labour Party\u2014which is widely expected to be in government by the end of the year\u2014has not set out its proposed rule, so it is not possible to say whether it will be better or worse. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is time to think afresh. Britain\u2019s specific rules have not given it a stable or sustainable fiscal position. To misquote a former prime minister, James Callaghan, in a previous fiscal crisis: I tell you in all candour that, even insofar as it was ever true, formulaic fiscal rules no longer work. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Instead I propose something more qualitative. Each year, just before the chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister) unveils the budget, the chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)\u2014the fiscal watchdog created in 2010 to provide independent forecasts and analysis\u2014should be required to write 250 words, summing up Britain\u2019s fiscal position, and the effect of the budget on that position. The chancellor would be required to read those exact words, without hesitation, repetition or deviation, as part of the budget speech. It takes two minutes to read 250 words. This is not a particularly large demand on the chancellor\u2019s time, or that of the House of Commons. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is not an ironclad fiscal straightjacket.

A chancellor who spent more on proven investments\u2014whether that is capital, or improving education, or getting people back into work\u2014could expect to read out similarly reassuring words.

This budget will exacerbate the problem. The government\u2019s fiscal plans for the next five years are worse than fiction, because with fiction an author has bothered to think about a storyline and an ending. The aggregate spending totals proposed are implausible: the government\u2019s overall fiscal position is not credible. The government has also failed to set out its departmental spending plans, so there are no credible public-service micro-foundations for the proposed fiscal stance. Our country has an ageing population and interest rates that are markedly higher than in recent years. In that context the government\u2014any government\u2014needs to spell out either a route to higher tax revenues, or to lower spending. Nothing else is credible.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is 125 words, leaving Mr Hughes with another 125 words to use in a sensible but appropriately robust way.
