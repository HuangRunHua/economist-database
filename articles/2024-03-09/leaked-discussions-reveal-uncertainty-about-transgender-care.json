The publication this week of hundreds of posts from an internal messaging forum will add fuel to this fire. The files show members of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), an interdisciplinary professional and educational association devoted to the field, discussing how to treat patients."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The non-profit group that published the files, Environmental Progress, which pushes strong views on more than just the environment, claims that the documents reveal \u201cwidespread medical malpractice on children and vulnerable adults\u201d. That claim is questionable. But WPATH\u2019s standards of care have been cited by other medical organisations, particularly in America. WPATH\u2019s president, Marci Bowers, said in response that \u201cWPATH is and has always been a science- and evidence-based organisation.\u201d Yet the discussions show that the provision of so-called gender-affirming care is riddled with far more doubt than WPATH\u2019s message that such treatments are \u201cnot considered experimental\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Shedding light on this field is helpful, even if the leaking of private information\u2014including names of practitioners\u2014is ethically dubious. Because gender-affirming care has become politicised, its practice has retreated into the shadows. It is rare to get a sense of what it entails. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Based on the files, WPATH has members who are worryingly dogmatic. But mostly the exchanges reveal a group of surgeons, social workers and therapists struggling with how best to serve patients. They debate the challenges of gaining informed consent for medical treatments from children and people with mental-health disorders. They exchange tips on how to deal with requests for \u201cnon-standard\u201d surgery, such as patients who would like to preserve their penis but also have a \u201cneovagina\u201d (through a procedure known as \u201cphallus-preserving vaginoplasty\u201d).

Colleagues agree that talking to a 14-year-old about fertility preservation brings reactions such as: \u201cEw, kids, babies, gross\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m going to adopt.\u201d One clinician admits that \u201cWe try to talk about it, but most of the kids are nowhere in any kind of brain space to really talk about it in a serious way.\u201d He adds: \u201cThat has always bothered me.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Concerns about making irreversible changes to children\u2019s bodies, and the impossibility of gaining their informed consent for this, have been at the heart of controversy over transgender medicine. In America 23 states have now restricted or banned such care for minors, even though almost all medical associations in America support it\u2014an issue the Supreme Court has been asked to rule on. Much less focus has been on whether adult patients with psychiatric disorders can give informed consent for such procedures. On that matter the files are especially revealing."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the autumn of 2021 several practitioners mentioned that they had a high number of patients with dissociative identity disorder (DID), formerly known as multiple-personality disorder.

Some members appeared to view DID primarily through the lens of identity. As one therapist put it: \u201cI too would love to hear from others how we as clinicians\u2026can work with these clients to honour their gender identity and fractured ego identities.\u201d For a field sometimes accused of over-medicalisation, such \u201cunder-medicalisation\u201d is just as troubling."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Are you sure?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The conversation ventures into the absurd\u2014and sounds more ideological than clinical\u2014when talking about unusual requests for body modifications. \u201cI\u2019ve found more and more patients recently requesting \u2018non-standard\u2019 procedures such as top surgery without nipples, nullification [the removal of all external genitalia], and phallus-preserving vaginoplasty,\u201d writes a surgeon from California.
