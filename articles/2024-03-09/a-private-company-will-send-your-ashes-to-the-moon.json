Many Americans opt for the traditional graveyard burial, others donate themselves to science. But if those don\u2019t sound like the posthumous experience you are looking for, a Houston-based firm has something different on offer. For just $13,000\u2014or a subscription fee of $99 per month until you pay it off\u2014Celestis Memorial Spaceflights will send your cremated ashes to the moon."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If you choose to fly to space in an aluminium capsule the size of a lipstick tube you will be in good company. Celestis\u2019s pioneer flight in 1997 carried the remains of Star Trek\u2019s screenwriter, a German rocket engineer, a Princeton University professor, a restaurateur and a Japanese boy. In the quarter-century since, the firm has sent 2,300 capsules into orbit. It has no doubt been helped by a huge increase in the share of Americans getting cremated, from 21% in the mid-1990s to 61% today."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For some the prospect is life-changing. Don McInnis, a disabled man living in Nova Scotia who has never held a job, is only in his 50s but has already paid off 20% of his flight.

In January tribal leaders met with the Biden administration to try to stop Celestis from sending ashes to space. To them the moon is sacred and death a taboo. They bury their dead within days, discard their belongings and never visit grave sites. If the moon becomes a full-on cemetery they will have to stop performing some traditional prayer ceremonies. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal to dump in the Grand Canyon,\u201d says Justin Ahasteen, the head of the Navajo Washington office, \u201cwhy can\u2019t that be the US policy for space?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To their relief the latest moon-bound rocket burned up over the Pacific in February, with 70 capsules aboard.
