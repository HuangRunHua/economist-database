He then estimated how that number might change under different conditions. His work suggests that stopping gangs from hiring fresh recruits is the most effective way to shrink them and reduce violence. If gangs were to take on only half of the 350 to 370 new people they currently need each week, by 2027 membership would be 155,000. If they faced a complete interdiction of new recruits, their numbers would fall to 110,000 by 2027.

To make it, Mexico would need a better understanding of how gangs go about hiring. Some people are forced into the job, either by being kidnapped or by applying for fake job advertisements, often that of security guard. Other young men (it is almost always men) willingly sign up, perhaps because of a lack of other opportunities or, Mr Prieto-Curiel reckons, the glamorising of cartels in TV shows.

Between them the two big cartels, Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation, employ over a quarter of the total number of gangsters.
