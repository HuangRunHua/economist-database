Over 90% agreed to remove a clause in their constitution that had long excluded Aboriginal people from national population counts, sending a message \u201cthat we would be recognised and that we would be able to enjoy equality\u201d, recalls Tom Calma, a Kungarakan elder from Darwin. Another referendum concerning Australia\u2019s relationship with its first people will be held on October 14th. This one poses a more complicated question\u2014and Australians seem unlikely to support it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Almost 18m, about 70% of Australia\u2019s population, are due to take part in a mandatory vote on whether to enshrine an indigenous advisory group, or \u201cVoice to Parliament\u201d, in the constitution. Doing so would recognise Aboriginal people as Australia\u2019s original inhabitants\u2014killing the old claim that Australia was terra nullius, nobody\u2019s land, when Captain James Cook found it in 1770. Every government this century has supported some form of constitutional recognition, but the centre-left prime minister Anthony Albanese is ambitious. His Labor government wants to establish a Voice that would guarantee Aboriginal people more sway in policymaking, in order to improve the dire conditions of many. Australians initially seemed supportive. Polls last December found 66% backed the Voice; now around 36% do."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Voice proponents are aghast. Mr Albanaese billed the referendum as a \u201ca once-in-a-generation chance to bring our country together\u201d. Unlike Canada, America and New Zealand, Australia never struck treaties with its original inhabitants. The idea for the Voice emerged from months of consultation with indigenous people to address that failure. The process culminated, in 2017, with a statement from Aboriginal elders blaming their community\u2019s poverty on \u201cthe torment of our powerlessness\u201d. They called for a treaty and truth-telling process, as well as an advisory body."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What explains the collapse in support for such measures? Most obviously, an aggressive and well-co-ordinated No campaign. Led by most members of the opposition, a centre-right coalition of the Liberal and National parties, these antis say the Voice would weaken Australia. It \u201cwill permanently divide us by race\u201d, claims Peter Dutton, leader of the Liberal Party. The antis are against special constitutional rights for any group. In a country where over half the population are first- or second-generation immigrants, some fear that giving a special dispensation to Aboriginal people could invite calls from other communities for similar treatment. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A debate in which race and citizenship are embroiled has raised \u201cvery sensitive issues about Australia\u2019s past and its heritage\u201d, says Ian McAllister of the Australian National University. The antis are appealing to \u201cracism and stupidity\u201d, says Marcia Langton, an indigenous academic. Voting Yes would \u201cdemonise colonial settlement in its entirety and nurture a national self-loathing\u201d, claims Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, a conservative indigenous senator."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A lack of clarity over how Voice members would be elected or held accountable has aided the No campaign. \u201cThe absence of details raises the question: what comes next?\u201d reads its pamphlet. Anti-Voice disinformation is rife. Predictions of voter fraud and claims that Aboriginal people will \u201ctake your land rights\u201d have spread online and at No-vote rallies. Tom Rogers, boss of the Australian Electoral Commission, calls such claims \u201ctinfoil-hat-wearing bonkers-mad conspiracy theories\u201d. Pauline Hanson, a hard-right senator, has added to them, suggesting the Voice could lead to the Northern Territory seceding to become \u201can Aboriginal Black state\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lack of bipartisan support alone could nix the proposal; no referendum in Australia has passed without it. And the Voice has relatively few staunch advocates. Even Labor voters consider it a low priority. The government\u2019s efforts to enlist support from celebrities and big business have not persuaded them otherwise. According to Mr McAllister, they have inspired a \u201cpopulist reaction against the elites telling ordinary people what they should do\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Yes campaign needs majorities in the national vote and in four of the six states. Compulsory voting will make this change even harder, says Malcolm Turnbull, a former conservative prime minister, because semi-engaged voters tend to be more risk-averse. A Yes vote, he suggests, would signal that \u201cAustralians have overcome concerns about the risks of change and taken a leap of optimism and faith\u201d. They appear much likelier to stick with the status quo. \u25a0"}], "id": 16}
