Beyond the plate-glass windows, snow-capped mountains glisten and pine trees sway. Inside, a small grey rectangle sits at the top of a blank Word document. With a few words of instruction, a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014or \u201cCopilot\u201d, as Microsoft calls it\u2014finds a vast file in a computer folder and summarises its contents. Later, it edits its own work and succinctly answers questions about the material.

This week the firm will launch a Copilot for Windows, its operating system, which will be able to change your computer\u2019s settings, generate images and summarise web pages. Copilots for its sales software and human-resources offerings are already available. One for its security software is in the works. In February Microsoft added ChatGPT-like functions to Bing, its search engine, in effect another Copilot.

The prize is potentially huge. Copilots could transform the world of work for the 1.2bn people who use Microsoft 365 and the 1.4bn who use Windows. This would allow Microsoft to bring in new customers and charge them more. That, in turn, could drive business to Azure, Microsoft\u2019s high-margin cloud business, possibly helping it overtake Amazon Web Services (AWS) to become the world\u2019s biggest cloud firm. It could even help Microsoft\u2019s valuation above the current $2.3trn, potentially closing the gap with Apple, currently the world\u2019s most valuable firm (see chart 1).

Teams, Microsoft\u2019s video-conference service, might be more attractive to IT managers than Zoom, a rival, if it features a Copilot that can sort through employees\u2019 emails in Outlook and summon up information from their Word documents and PowerPoints. All this wizardry can also be channelled through Azure, further boosting Microsoft\u2019s business."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nonetheless Microsoft is also taking a big gamble. Next year its capital spending is expected to jump by almost two-fifths, to about $40bn. That is a near-record 16% of the firm\u2019s revenue and a higher share than any other tech giant save Meta, the parent of Facebook. Much of this will be spent on new AI chips and high-performance networking to go into the 120-odd extra data centres it plans to bring online. Whether such an investment will pay off is an open question. For all their promise, Copilots still have plenty of problems. At the demonstration in Redmond the AI-generated slide show described your correspondent as \u201cCEO of ABC Inc\u201d, which he definitely is not. Competitors, in particular Alphabet (the parent of Google), are eyeing up all the same markets. As the battle over the future of work heats up, Microsoft\u2019s position is enviable but not unassailable."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Putting itself in that position has been a long endeavour. Microsoft\u2019s heyday was in the 1990s. The dominance of Windows as an operating system combined with a cut-throat business mentality made the firm mighty but roundly despised. A period of stagnation followed, as it lived off the revenue from Windows. When Satya Nadella took over in 2014, he shook things up. Windows would no longer be the firm\u2019s main focus. Instead the company was reorganised around Azure, with blockbuster programmes, such as Office, shifting to the cloud. This involved an enormous build-out of data centres. Microsoft\u2019s capital spending went from 6% of revenue in 2014 to 11% five years later. Crucially, the firm moved away from a walled-garden approach. Mr Nadella allowed Microsoft\u2019s software to run on other operating systems, such as Google\u2019s, Apple\u2019s and Linux, an open-source rival to Windows."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All the while Microsoft was also investing in AI. It first announced it was working with OpenAI in 2016; it has since invested $13bn, for what is reported to be a 49% stake. The deal not only allows Microsoft to use OpenAI\u2019s technology, but also stipulates that OpenAI\u2019s models and tools run on Azure, in effect making OpenAI\u2019s customers into indirect clients of Microsoft. And it isn\u2019t just OpenAI. Microsoft has bought 15 AI-related firms since Mr Nadella took over. That includes paying $20bn for Nuance, a health-care firm with cutting-edge speech-to-text technology, in 2022.

The first is Azure. For the past five years it has been closing in on AWS (see chart 2). Cloud spending is slowing as IT managers tighten purse strings. Despite this, in the most recent quarter the business grew by 27% year on year. Microsoft does not reveal Azure\u2019s sales, but analysts think that it accounts for about a quarter of the firm\u2019s revenue, which hit $212bn last year. Gross margins for its cloud business are also secret, but Bernstein puts them at a lofty 60% or so."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Second is Microsoft 365, which also accounts for about a quarter of revenue. That has been growing by about 10% a year of late, thanks to take-up among smaller businesses, especially in service industries such as restaurants. The third source of growth is cybersecurity. In earnings calls Microsoft executives have said it accounts for roughly $20bn in revenue (about a tenth of the total). That is more than the combined revenues of the five biggest firms that provide only cybersecurity. What is more, revenues are growing by around 30% each year. (Microsoft\u2019s video-game arm, which brings in $15bn a year, is also set to grow substantially now that British antitrust regulators have signalled they will approve the long-delayed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, another gamemaker, for $69bn.)"}, {"role": "second", "text": "Blue fine-tuner"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Using Azure as the underlying infrastructure for Microsoft\u2019s other businesses has helped spread costs, streamline operations and boost profits.

During Mr Nadella\u2019s tenure Microsoft\u2019s market value has risen by about $2trn. Microsoft\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio, an indication of investors\u2019 expectations of future profits, has more than doubled during Mr Nadella\u2019s reign, to 32.

The first is the range of software it sells. Asking a single chatbot to peruse emails and spreadsheets to pull together a slide show is much easier than dealing with different AI helpers for each programme."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Second, Microsoft has a first-mover advantage. It has been quicker to deploy AI than rivals, thanks to its tie-up with ChatGPT and possibly also because Mr Nadella feels that it was slow to react to smartphones and the cloud. Whatever the reason, Microsoft\u2019s speed has made OpenAI the default for big firms trying out the technology. A recent survey of IT managers by JPMorgan Chase, a bank, found that over the next three years they expected 56% of their spending on generative AI to go to Microsoft compared with 13% for AWS and 12% for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another survey by Sequoia, a venture-capital firm, of 33 startups that it invests in, found that 90% of them used OpenAI.

That includes consultants who specialise in its tools and recommend that clients use them, as well as software sellers, such as HubSpot, which build bespoke programmes that use OpenAI\u2019s models."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is some evidence for the idea that Copilots could help cement Microsoft\u2019s lead. In June 2022 it launched a code-generating Copilot on GitHub, a repository for code which Microsoft had bought in 2018 for $7.5bn. The model was trained using the reams of code stored on GitHub. It has quickly become an essential tool for software developers. In a survey, 90% of users told GitHub that the Copilot improved their productivity. The firm also conducted a small study that found that coders completed tasks 55% more quickly when using the tool. Some 27,000 businesses have a subscription, twice the number of three months ago. It is so popular in tech circles that the term \u201ccopilot\u201d has become shorthand for an AI assistant, whether provided by Microsoft or not."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Microsoft says firms testing a Copilot for its \u201cproductivity\u201d software (meaning, for email, spreadsheets, word-processing and the like) report similar benefits. Kate Johnson, the boss of Lumen, a telecoms firm, describes it as a \u201cstep function change\u201d in the way her staff work. She uses it to look back at Teams meetings and see whether quieter employees are being given a chance to speak. It also takes instant minutes and draws up to-do lists for attendees. That helps with accountability, adds Ms Johnson: the tasks staff were meant to complete after the last meeting are \u201cright there for everyone to see\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Copilots can also act as software coaches, teaching workers how to insert charts in spreadsheets, for example. The goal is that they will eventually be able to learn users\u2019 preferences and even their writing style. \u201cWe hope one day to deliver a highly effective alter ego\u2014an agent that knows you deeply,\u201d Mr Nadella wrote in his book \u201cHit Refresh\u201d, published in 2017."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All this does not come cheap.

In May it announced its \u201cCopilot Stack\u201d on Azure. This makes it easy for developers to build Copilots in their own applications or to create \u201cplugins\u201d for Microsoft\u2019s Copilots. The hope is that lots of firms use this infrastructure, sending much more business to Azure. Another advantage of this \u201cplatform\u201d approach is that Microsoft may be able to strike deals to use the data of Azure\u2019s clients to bring, say, legal expertise into a Word document or email. That creates an advantage that \u201ccompetitors are going to find very difficult or impossible to replicate\u201d, a research note from Bernstein argues."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Hammerhead"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the second quarter of the year AI added roughly $120m to Microsoft\u2019s cloud revenues.

New Street Research, a firm of stockmarket analysts, reckons that Microsoft is the biggest customer of Nvidia, the world\u2019s largest seller of AI chips. Its research suggests that Microsoft spent roughly $3bn on Nvidia\u2019s AI chips in the second quarter of 2023, up from about $1bn in the first quarter. In a call with investors in July, Amy Hood, the chief financial officer, noted that the AI build-out is putting pressure on Microsoft\u2019s puffy margins in the cloud. That is being offset, she says, by more efficient data-crunching.
