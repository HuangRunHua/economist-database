After more than a year of economic free fall\u2014in which the former president fled protests, gdp shrank by 9% and billions of dollars of arrears piled up\u2014the imf was in town, ready to release $330m from a bail-out agreed in March. There was even talk that the country\u2019s creditors would reach a deal to cut back its debts. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the fund\u2019s officials flew back from Colombo without releasing a dollar. The problem was two-fold: Sri Lanka\u2019s tiny tax take and China, which is the country\u2019s biggest creditor. The imf cannot lend more unless Sri Lanka restructures its debts, since the country owes so much elsewhere that officials cannot otherwise be sure they will get their money back. Therefore by refusing to take a haircut on its debts, China is holding up Sri Lanka\u2019s restructuring\u2014as it is in other indebted countries, too."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230930_FNC765.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the same day that the imf officials departed, Bloomberg, a news service, reported that other national creditors, led by India, were working on a deal, and that it would not include China. They may end up insisting that Sri Lanka suspends repayments to China or forces it onto a comparable deal. Either would be almost impossible to enforce. Creditors usually only agree to something because everyone agrees to the same terms. Even creditors at war with one another usually manage to hash out a deal. The decision to proceed without China reveals the extent of the breakdown in sovereign-debt negotiations."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was hoped that a recent deal in Zambia, to which China signed up, would provide a template. But the solution was unique to the structure of Zambian debt, which allowed creditors to relabel some Chinese lending as private rather than public. And China only agreed to much of the compromise, which includes low interest rates and slower repayment, on the condition that it could back out if Zambia\u2019s economy picked up. At a recent g20 summit, where the agenda ranged from cryptocurrencies to global tax, officials observed that debt restructuring was the issue on which the least progress had been made."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Worse, middle-income countries like Sri Lanka cannot even get into the process through which Zambia secured its deal. The Common Framework, a g20 mechanism for creditors, only applies to poor countries. Middle-income ones must negotiate with China alone. Chinese officials refuse even to sit on a committee with the rest of Sri Lanka\u2019s national creditors. Many economies near default today, from Egypt to Pakistan, are also too rich to qualify. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s situation also exposes a worrying new fault line. Some think that China was put off joining Sri Lanka\u2019s creditor committee because India was a co-chair. After all, it was willing to participate in Zambia\u2019s committee, which it jointly led with France. Such tensions will only become more of a problem, since India\u2019s lending is growing. Bradley Parks of William &amp; Mary, an American university, suspects that India\u2019s officials have decided to lend to countries already indebted to China to counter their rival\u2019s influence. Future standoffs are therefore likely to be in places where both countries are big creditors.
