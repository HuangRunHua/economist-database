Parents object to what they teach children about sex. History can be ideologically charged. Maps sometimes provoke anger in neighbouring countries.

The governors of several states refused to distribute them. Parents have burned them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mexico is among the few countries in which the national government produces the approved textbooks for all schools, public and private. Cuba, North Korea and Nicaragua, all dictatorships, are among the others. Mexico began its policy in 1959, saying that obliging schools to use the same books, and providing them free, would help reduce inequality in a stratified society. Most six- to 15-year-olds study in the public system: some 21.5m compared with just 2.7m in private schools.

He sees himself as a transformational leader, and textbooks are a cheap way to bring about big changes. This year, the fifth of his six-year term, he has introduced a shake-up of the curriculum, textbooks included, that he calls the \u201cNew Mexican School\u201d. Mexico needs education reform. It performs poorly on PISA, an international test of the reading, maths and science skills of 15- and 16-year-olds (see chart).

On taking office in 2018 he reversed a reform by the previous government that curbed the power of the teachers\u2019 union and introduced performance reviews. He disbanded a body that evaluated the quality and performance of public education (there are no plans to assess his new curriculum). His government does give out more scholarships than the previous one did; but they help children attend badly performing schools.

The new curriculum and books are likely to increase the inequality that uniform textbooks sought to lessen.
