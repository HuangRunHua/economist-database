Though female political representation has improved in India in recent years, it is still miserably low. Only 15% of the members of the lower house, the Lok Sabha, are women, a smaller share than in Nepal and Pakistan (where gender quotas are already in place). The situation is even worse at state level, where women make up just 9% of elected representatives. Implementing the quota could take years, however. Constituencies must be redrawn, for which a long-delayed census must first be completed. \u25a0"}], "id": 17}
