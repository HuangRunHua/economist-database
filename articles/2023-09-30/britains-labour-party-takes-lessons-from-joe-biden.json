It was a nod to another photo taken at the same spot of Tony Blair, then the new prime minister, Bill Clinton, then the president, and their wives. That was in 1998, a time of \u201cthird way\u201d politics, when the leaders of the Labour and the Democratic parties hoped to fuse a belief in free markets with social progress.

The party has long drawn from Democratic waters: even Jeremy Corbyn, the previous leader who loathed American power, found a soulmate in Bernie Sanders. But rarely has it drunk as deeply as today. Polls suggest Sir Keir Starmer is on course to become prime minister in an election that is almost certain next year. Joe Biden\u2019s administration is providing the party with inspiration for its electoral strategy, an economic agenda, and an approach to geopolitics. Its MPs and advisers make pilgrimages to Washington; speeches by Mr Biden\u2019s aides are pored over. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the world has changed since 1998. Britain remains a vital American security partner\u2014underscored by the war in Ukraine\u2014and an important trade partner. Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, has proved to be a more reliable interlocutor than Boris Johnson, a predecessor. But the country\u2019s influence in Washington has perceptibly declined. \u201cThe whole relationship has weakened steadily over the last 20 years,\u201d says Bronwen Maddox of Chatham House, a think-tank.

Britain surrendered its role as the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of America in Brussels, just as the workload shifted from humdrum issues of bilateral trade to strategic competition with China, he says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Washington, therefore, does not pay much heed to Westminster. But for Labour strategists worrying if stolid Sir Keir could win back industrial heartlands lost to Mr Johnson in 2019, there is much to absorb. The narrow victory of Mr Biden over Donald Trump in much of the American rustbelt the following year brought a shot of hope. Centre-left parties everywhere are engaged in \u201chigh-level brainstorming among people wrestling with the same challenge,\u201d says Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy Institute, a think-tank that was the centre of \u201cthird way\u201d ferment. At heart, he says, that means addressing \u201cthe disconnection between progressive parties and the working class.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Labour staff have taken lessons from the Biden campaign in how it used data, framed economic policy in terms of job creation, and avoided culture-war fights. \u201cThe design of the machine came from the principles we were learning from people like the Democrats,\u201d says a party official. \u201cIt gives us a template, because like us they had drifted off to being just a primarily university-educated electoral coalition.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Lammy sees a chance for Britain to benefit from a \u201cprogressive moment\u201d, if a Labour victory were to coincide with the re-election of Mr Biden and, perhaps fleetingly, centre-left and liberal governments in Australia, Canada, France and Germany. He acknowledges overlaps with Bidenism. His refrain that diplomats should have hard-pressed Britons at the forefront of their minds echoes the administration\u2019s \u201cforeign policy for the middle class,\u201d which holds that those setting policy should discard stale theory and focus on the needs of industrial workers.

Military aid to Ukraine, support for NATO, the AUKUS submarine deal with Australia and a fighter-jet deal with Italy and Japan\u2014all will stay. He also proposed a transatlantic anti-kleptocracy push, which was an early priority of the Biden administration. (Given London\u2019s reputation as a laundromat for loot, it is an area where Britain\u2019s government could make a mark). The Biden administration\u2019s agenda for the \u201chealth of democracies\u201d\u2014free elections, human rights and so on\u2014may find a more natural partner in Labour, because some Democrats see the Tories \u201cswimming in the same ocean of nationalism\u201d as the Trump movement, argues Ben Rhodes, a former adviser to Barack Obama."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Starmernomics for the people"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The biggest change would come in economic policy. Mr Sunak\u2019s government sees aspects of Bidenomics\u2014a mixture of vast subsidies and trade restrictions with the aims of boosting domestic manufacturing, reducing dependency on China and tackling climate change\u2014as dangerous protectionism.

Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, has drawn on work from think-tanks close to the Biden administration, including the Centre for American Progress and the Roosevelt Institute.

Appearing alongside Heather Boushey, a White House economist, in London on September 14th, Mr Miliband derided those who regard the agenda as protectionist. \u201cIt\u2019s a very old-fashioned neoliberal view of economic policy, honestly,\u201d he said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Others in the shadow cabinet see more clearly how hard it will be to replicate Bidenomics in a midsized country with weak public finances.

In June Ms Reeves delayed the \u00a328bn target to 2027, and stressed it will be subject to her fiscal rules, that require debt to fall as a share of GDP. Less than a third of the money has been publicly earmarked for projects, and there is a moratorium on announcing more until Labour\u2019s fiscal inheritance becomes clear.

The hope of creating thousands of non-graduate industrial jobs via subsidies \u201cdefies any sort of realism\u201d, he argues, given Britain\u2019s borrowing capacity, labour-market limitations and small market size.

But it is growing more ambitious in seeking a diplomatic role. Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, hosted Sir Keir in Paris on September 19th. The prospect of Ukraine joining the EU could mean redrawing the architecture of Europe, and Mr Lammy wants to explore an idea long promoted in France of a continent of concentric circles, with Britain as an active player on its outer rim. The party proposes new and rebooted defence agreements with the EU, Germany and France, and \u201cstructured dialogue\u201d to chew over strategic challenges. \u201cWe want to be inside of the room when big decisions are being made around nearshoring, supply chains and rare-earth minerals,\u201d Mr Lammy says.

His anglophilia is shallow: in his first term, he repeatedly humiliated Theresa May, then prime minister, who stuck tight with France and Germany on climate and Iran policy. For Sir Keir, the \u201cprogressive moment\u201d would be dust. A champion of NATO, Ukraine and European co-operation would find a White House indifferent or hostile to all three. Labour figures hope that Mr Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric remains just that.
