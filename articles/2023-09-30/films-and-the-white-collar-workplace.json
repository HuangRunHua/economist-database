Desk warriors can occasionally be caught up in dramatic stories, whether journalists (\u201cSpotlight\u201d), lawyers (\u201cDark Waters\u201d) or whistleblowers (\u201cThe Informant\u201d). The greed and fear of high finance (\u201cDumb Money\u201d) have an enduring appeal. But office-based blockbusters are still pretty thin on the ground: typing, malfunctioning toilets and meetings are just not that exciting. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is a simple fix. Take film titles that have already done well with cinema-goers and tweak their plots for the white-collar workplace.

An office worker logs into the Bloomberg terminal for the first time in the hope of quickly finding some information. She finds that it does not respond to normal commands.

He seems unable to move on from this career highlight, even though the rest of the world has. He talks only in 18-minute monologues that always start with a personal anecdote. When he speaks, he invariably stands up, paces from side to side and ends each sentence staring purposefully into the middle distance. His family and friends find him completely insufferable and all desert him."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cAvatar\u201d.
