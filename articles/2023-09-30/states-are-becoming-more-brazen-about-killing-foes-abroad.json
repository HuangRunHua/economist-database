It has also brought into sharp relief an incendiary facet of the new world disorder: assassinations. Killings of dissidents and terrorists, and of political or military figures, are as old as politics itself, but their incidence may be rising. Ukraine targets occupiers and collaborators; Russia has tried to kill Ukraine\u2019s president. On September 25th Ukraine claimed to have killed the head of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, only for him seemingly to appear in a video a day later.

They resent what they view as Western double standards on state-sponsored killings. New technologies make it easier than ever for governments to strike their enemies with precision, even from great distances. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet even as assassinations are becoming easier, and perhaps more frequent, the world has not yet figured out how to respond to them. You only need to look at the West\u2019s response to such killings. Russia\u2019s assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB agent, in Britain in 2006 caused an outcry and led to sanctions. After the gruesome murder in 2018 in Istanbul of Jamal Khashoggi, an exiled Saudi journalist living in America, Joe Biden said Saudi Arabia should be treated as a pariah. Yet last year he fist-bumped Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, and is seeking to coax him into making peace with Israel. Meanwhile India denies involvement in Mr Nijjar\u2019s death and may avoid any serious consequences relating to it. The world\u2019s most populous country is important to the West, both as an economic partner and a geopolitical counterweight to China. These inconsistencies reflect a longstanding moral and legal maze over state-backed killings."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Bible may extol the Israelite Ehud for killing Eglon, the oppressive and \u201cvery fat\u201d Moabite king. Yet it also commands obedience to authority, \u201cFor rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.\u201d Assassination, in the sense of killing a prominent person for a political motive with no legal process, carries the connotation of perfidy. Dante placed Julius Caesar\u2019s killers in the deepest circle of hell, alongside Judas, their bodies gnawed on by Satan. Yet states kill prominent foes abroad\u2014for different reasons and with varied methods. A paper in 2016 by Warner Schilling and Jonathan Schilling lists 14 possible objectives, from revenge to weakening an enemy or destroying a rival state.

Some 298 assassination attempts on national leaders were reported between 1875 and 2004, according to a paper by Benjamin Jones and Benjamin Olken published by the American Economic Journal in 2009.

He offers two big reasons: authoritarian regimes \u201care becoming more brazen\u201d about challenging liberal norms; and democracies\u2019 resort to targeted killings has \u201cemboldened other states\u201d. Other factors, such as ease of travel and drones that make possible long-distance surveillance and strikes, probably worsen the problem.

And assassination risks retaliation: both Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, respectively a former American secretary of state and national security adviser, have allegedly been the targets of an Iranian assassination plot.

Revelations of its secret efforts to kill leaders such as Fidel Castro of Cuba (unsuccessfully) and Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic (successfully) caused a backlash.

One step is to declare that it includes responding to attacks by non-state actors as well as by states. The next is to aver a right to \u201canticipatory self-defence\u201d, allowing a country to use force to forestall an \u201cimminent\u201d threat of attack. The most widely accepted definition is that the threat should be \u201cinstant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation\u201d. But this, too, has been stretched.

Though it has much abated, Sikh violence could flare up again. India claims that Mr Nijjar was a terrorist and offered a reward for his capture; his supporters say that he was a peaceful activist. In India\u2019s view, the West\u2019s refusal to clamp down on Sikh separatists poses a menace. The government, though, prefers to say it has nothing to do with Mr Nijjar\u2019s death.
