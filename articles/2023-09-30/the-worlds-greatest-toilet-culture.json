The film features a real-life project by leading architects, such as Ando Tadao and Kuma Kengo, to renovate 17 public toilets in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya ward. Whereas toilets are often considered \u201cdark, dirty and smelly\u201d, says Yamada Akiko of the Nippon Foundation, which launched the project in 2018, \u201cwe wanted to transform that image.\u201d The ubiquity of Tokyo\u2019s loos is also impressive. London has 14 public toilets per 100,000 residents; Tokyo has 53. Their high-tech features are remarkable. Beyond heated seats and \u201cwashlets\u201d, which spray water and blow air onto users, they include the oto-hime or \u201csound princess\u201d, which makes flushing sounds to mask embarrassing noises. Maritomo, a commentator on Japanese toilets (who only uses one name), considers them symbolic of Japanese hospitality.

After the Meiji restoration of 1868, it promoted greater hygiene as a proxy for modernisation. Japanese ceramics firms branched into producing elaborate loos. After the second world war, American occupiers introduced mechanised waste disposal to what remained of the night-soil industry. With Japan\u2019s economic recovery came a new wave of high-tech toilets based on Western models, raising the country\u2019s toilet culture to its current heights. \u201cI was amazed at how much toilets can be part of everyday culture,\u201d said Mr Wenders in an interview."}], "id": 14}
