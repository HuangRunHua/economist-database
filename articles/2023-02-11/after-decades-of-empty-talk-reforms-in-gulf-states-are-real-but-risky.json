Meanwhile he had made the circuses themselves a civic duty: go forth and have fun to help build a new Saudi Arabia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It seemed to be working. The prince was popular, particularly among young people. Yet the writer sensed a contradiction.

But how long could Saudis live on circuses alone?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For decades the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), a club of petro-monarchies, maintained similar social contracts.

The two groups lived mostly separate lives."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No longer. The past few years have been a time of rapid change in the GCC. Saudi Arabia is shaking off many of its social restrictions and opening up to the world. There is talk across the Gulf of pushing citizens out of make-work sinecures and into the private sector. Policies that were unthinkable, from subsidy cuts and new taxes to cohabitation and civil marriage, are being implemented with little fuss."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The GCC is not a monolith. In Kuwait it feels as if nothing has changed for a generation (to the chagrin of many citizens). With an ocean of natural gas and a tiny population, Qatar is in no hurry to shrink the public-wage bill. But Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have moved fastest.
