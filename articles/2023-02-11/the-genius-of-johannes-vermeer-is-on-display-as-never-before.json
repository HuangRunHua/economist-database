The morning light glints on the metal tacks in her chairs. Her lips are slightly parted, as if she is murmuring the message aloud."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The intimacy of Johannes Vermeer\u2019s domestic scenes can seem almost voyeuristic. Some of his figures look at you as if turning towards an intruder. Yet they are also tantalisingly inscrutable, glimpsed from a distance or sealed in private reveries. In \u201cWoman in Blue Reading a Letter\u201d, you see the light but not the window it is pouring through. You see the letter but not the words."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The painting is among the treasures of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and among the 28 by Vermeer, gathered from seven countries, in an exhibition that opens there on February 10th. That is around three-quarters of his surviving works\u2014more than have ever been shown together before, and more than the painter himself would have seen in one go, notes Taco Dibbits, the museum\u2019s director. It is a one-off tribute to his genius, and his particular form of it: the fierce, patient genius of perfected technique. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the absence of letters or diaries, Vermeer\u2019s personality is famously hazy. Still, documents and records plot the outline of his life. He was born in 1632 in Delft, where his parents ran an inn called the Flying Fox. His well-heeled Catholic mother-in-law may have disapproved of him, a lowly Protestant-born artist. He had more than a dozen children. Early on, young and ambitious, he painted big: a myth, a Bible scene, a saint. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In around 1657 his canvases and themes shrank, and he made his leap to immortality. In troubled times, nouveau-riche Dutch collectors wanted pictures of refined interiors and everyday life. Vermeer\u2019s contemporaries developed genres and techniques that he emulated, then soared beyond them in his use of colour and perspective and, above all, his unmatched mastery of light."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Take \u201cThe Love Letter\u201d, in which a maid has handed a letter to her seated mistress. The woman seems perturbed, the maid puckish; perhaps she already knows the news. The viewer is positioned in the shadows beyond a drawn curtain, a recurring motif in these pictures. Eavesdropping on the conversation in \u201cOfficer and Laughing Girl\u201d, you see the girl\u2019s bright grin but the features of the hulking officer are obscure. When men intrude into Vermeer\u2019s domesticity, tension courses beneath the decorum. In \u201cThe Glass of Wine\u201d, light sparkles on the emptying glass that masks the woman\u2019s face. The man\u2019s hat shades his eyes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Vermeer\u2019s solo figures read and write, pour milk, make music or lace. A quiet drama hums below their repose, too. Nothing happens yet something seems to, in their heads and yours. The longing and vulnerability in the face of \u201cGirl with a Pearl Earring\u201d are an invitation to storytelling and memes; here she keeps company with the other close-up character studies he painted in the mid-1660s."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Through such juxtapositions the show traces the development of Vermeer\u2019s craft and the modulations in its themes and moods. He was probably familiar with the camera obscura, a device that projected an image through a pinhole and onto a screen in a darkened chamber (new research suggests he may have been introduced to it by the Jesuits of Delft). As Mr Dibbits explains, the contraption\u2019s influence is evident in the dots of colour the artist used to simulate the effects of light, the resulting mix of sharpness and blur making his vision seem startlingly real."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In this way he turned a couple of rooms and a few objects\u2014a lute, a glass, some pearls\u2014into miniature breathing worlds. You need not know all the allegorical meanings of his props, nor the socioeconomic connotations of the clothes, to sense the depth under the surface. Letters written and received, the maps mounted on Vermeer\u2019s walls\u2014and, above all, those windows and that light\u2014imply and withhold the promise and peril of the world outside."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He died in 1675, penniless at 43 after the outbreak of war ruined the Dutch art market and him. Little-known for the next two centuries, today he is an artistic deity. At the heart of the Rijksmuseum\u2019s mesmerising homage is that exquisite combination of intimacy and distance. Painted more than 350 years ago, his subjects still seem hauntingly alive, but their thoughts and secrets will for ever be theirs alone. As well as any painter, in other words, Vermeer did something that painting may do best: he captured the eternal mystery of other people. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:A Broadway musical updates \u201cSome Like It Hot\u201d (Jan 26th)The truth about Stone Mountain\u2019s giant Confederate memorial (Jan 12th)The year of the underdogs (Dec 20th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
