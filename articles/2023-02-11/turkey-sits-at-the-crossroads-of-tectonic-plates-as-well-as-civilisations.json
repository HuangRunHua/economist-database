This horrifying impact stems largely from shoddy construction practices and from the timing of the quake, which occurred while people were sleeping. But any seismic event this powerful\u2014the biggest quakes were of magnitude 7.8 and 7.5\u2014would inflict grave damage.

Quakes tend to occur along the boundaries between tectonic plates, the segments of Earth\u2019s crust that get moved around by convection currents in the hot mantle below. Along the fault lines that separate plates, crustal rocks move slowly past each other, often sticking and jamming. This causes strain to accumulate until the fault slips, causing an earthquake."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230211_WOF960.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 2742.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The eastern Mediterranean has a particularly complex tectonic structure involving several \u201cmicroplates\u201d, including the Anatolian plate, on which most of Turkey sits. A mere 100m years ago, this plate comprised part of the southern shore of a sea called Tethys, which separated Africa from Eurasia. As this body of water closed up, leaving the Aral, Black, Caspian and Mediterranean seas as its only remnants, the Anatolian plate drifted north. It then got squeezed between four others, including the Arabian plate to the south-east (which is migrating north) and the Eurasian plate to the north (which is moving south). Both of these plates are still pushing into their small Anatolian neighbour today."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the wake of a catastrophic earthquake near Istanbul in 1999, Turkish leaders vowed to improve seismic preparedness. That tremor originated in the North Anatolian fault, the Anatolian plate\u2019s boundary with the Eurasian plate, which has been the source of most of Turkey\u2019s large quakes. In contrast, the East Anatolian fault, where it rubs up against the Arabian plate, had not seen a quake of at least magnitude seven since modern monitoring systems began in the late 19th century."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230211_WOF959.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1249.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many other active fault systems, such as the Cascadia subduction zone in the north-western United States and south-western Canada, have gone centuries without an earthquake.
