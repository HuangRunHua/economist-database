It is also the title of China\u2019s top-selling film over the recent Lunar New Year holiday. The movie has grossed more than 4bn yuan ($590m) since its release on January 22nd."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The film is set four years after the death of Yue, who famously led the Song kingdom\u2019s battles against invading Jurchens, whose descendants became known as Manchus. Legend says he was killed in 1142 by Qin Hui, a corrupt Song chancellor who pushed the emperor to negotiate and stop fighting the Jurchens. In Chinese lore Qin is recalled as a hanjian, or traitor to one\u2019s Han ethnicity, and Yue as the opposite."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In recent years, the Communist Party has drawn on Yue\u2019s story to promote patriotism. State media even say that Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, was raised on tales of Yue\u2019s exploits. The movie, by one of China\u2019s most famous directors, Zhang Yimou, has aroused vitriolic fervour. Not only have cinema-goers delivered spontaneous recitations of the chilling poem at film screenings. The movie has also prompted an increase in attacks on statues of Qin at tourist sites\u2014a practice that has a long tradition."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The film is about the assassination of a Jurchen envoy in Qin\u2019s court. There are twists and turns as characters reveal their hidden loyalties, whether to foreigners or to the Song dynasty. Qin and his lackeys are portrayed as conniving officials who lie, cheat, and kill for power\u2014and betray the ethnic-Han people. The film\u2019s heroes are undercover vigilantes who resent Qin\u2019s behaviour and infiltrate his court to avenge Yue."}, {"role": "body", "text": "They try to recruit a young commander in Qin\u2019s army, Sun Jun, who is torn between obedience to his traitorous superiors and loyalty to his people. In one scene, Sun cuts a tattoo that says \u201cServe the nation with utmost loyalty\u201d off his vigilante uncle\u2019s back as his uncle shouts that Sun is a flunkey and a \u201crunning dog\u201d of foreigners (an oft-used insult among Chinese nationalists today). By the end, Sun turns against Qin. He leads the Han soldiers in a recitation of Yue\u2019s poem and expression of their fervent desire to recover lost land. That scene made some viewers cry, according to reviews on Douban, a film website."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFull River Red\u201d draws on ancient history, but its modern meaning is clear. The poem is a lament that national shame has not been avenged: it talks of retaking lost \u201cmountains and rivers\u201d. In case that is not explicit enough, one Chinese family made a video of themselves reciting the poem after watching the film, but replaced its words with modern terms. Let us \u201cfeast on American imperialists\u2019 flesh\u201d and \u201cdrink Han traitors\u2019 blood,\u201d they chant\u2014and \u201cunify all of China in coming years\u201d.
