Shamans (who are traditionally trained by other shamans) learn to enter trances\u2014aided by drumming, singing, dancing or, occasionally, psychotropic drugs\u2014to commune with spirits. Such beliefs date back to hunter-gatherer societies. \u201cWe talk about [prostitution being] the oldest profession but really, it\u2019s shamanism,\u201d says Simon Buxton of the Sacred Trust, a shamanic training centre."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If shamanism has a long history, it was barely practised in Britain until recently. In the English and Welsh census of 2011 just 650 people said it was their religion. But its popularity is increasing. In the census of 2021, the results of which were released in November, that figure had increased to 8,000. Partly because the numbers are small, that makes shamanism Britain\u2019s fastest-growing faith.

Paganism, another religion rooted in nature, is also on the rise. \u201cIt gives people a spiritual outlet for their political beliefs [about climate change],\u201d says Mr Buxton."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A small but growing number of therapists integrate shamanism into their work.

They might also help patients with \u201csoul loss\u201d\u2014what others would call post-traumatic stress disorder\u2014by searching for a lost part of them in the spirit realm.
