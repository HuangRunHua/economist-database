Last April she seized the opportunity to migrate to Australia through its government\u2019s \u201cworking holiday\u201d programme, which affords one-year visas to under-31-year-olds. She spent four months working on a farm in eastern Australia and now works as a barista in Sydney. What started as an adventure has found an economic logic. The minimum wage Ms Ashihara earns is, at A$21.38 ($14.9) an hour, twice as high as Japan\u2019s. Even working part-time, she makes more than she did toiling as a lowly office lady in Tokyo."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Ashihara is one of growing number of Japanese drawn to work abroad. Japanese applicants for Australia\u2019s working holiday visa more than doubled in 2022. A recruitment platform called Indeed reports seeing record numbers of searches for overseas jobs. Study abroad agents have started advertising the term dekasegi ryugaku (\u201cearning money while studying overseas\u201d). \u201cYou could be doing the exact same job as in Japan and earn twice as much in another country,\u201d says Hirawatari Junichi, a career consultant. \u201cMore and more young people have become interested in earning money in a stronger currency\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The historically weak yen is probably fuelling the trend. So, more troublingly, is the longer-term problem of Japanese wages, which have hardly increased in three decades. The average annual wage in Japan is $39,700, well below the oecd average of $51,600. In Japan\u2019s seniority-based employment system, recent university graduates can expect to earn around \u00a5220,000 ($1,670) a month."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Young Japanese are understandably pessimistic about their prospects. In addition to low salaries, many are growing increasingly dissatisfied with Japan\u2019s rigid, time-serving corporate culture. A survey by the Nippon Foundation, a non-profit, showed that only 14% of young Japanese believe that their country\u2019s future will \u201cget better\u201d. \u201cMany are struggling because wages are so low,\u201d says Furusawa Yuta, 21, who recently moved to Canada to work and save money. When Tsuyuki Sho, 29, who works in it, noticed how much higher wages were in his industry in other rich countries, he felt a \u201csense of crisis\u201d. He moved to America to work in 2019."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Japan\u2019s declining population and acute labour shortage mean it can ill afford any loss of talent. And a bigger exodus could be looming, as the growing frustrations of young Japanese get the better of the poor foreign-language skills and risk aversion that are common to many. Some experts fear Japan could at the same time start losing out to neighbouring countries such as South Korea and Taiwan in the contest to attract the migrant South-East Asian workers that all need. \u201cJapan is losing its attractiveness as a place to work,\u201d frets Noguchi Yukio, professor emeritus at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Life in Japan is still in many ways attractive. Its recent inflation has been much more moderate than elsewhere in the rich world and its housing is more affordable. \u201cI came to America hoping to save lots of dollars, but at one point I was spending all my income\u201d, recalls Mr Tsuyuki. He reckons there is no country \u201cthat could beat Japan in terms of liveability,\u201d including safety and cleanliness. He also misses his excursions to Japanese fast-food chains, which serve tasty meals at pocket-change prices."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet affordability is a flipside of the country\u2019s economic stagnation. Since the burst of the country\u2019s bubble economy in the 1990s, Japan had been stuck in a \u201cdeflationary mindset\u201d, where firms hesitate to pass on high prices to consumers. Thanks to the falling yen and mild inflation triggered by higher import costs, public frustration with the resultant stagnant wages is at last becoming evident. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ochiai Yuri, 24, who moved to Australia a year ago, also enthuses about the pleasantness of some things back home: \u201cEverything in Japan is orderly and well-maintained. The trains always come on time and the customer service is great.\u201d But she no longer considers returning to her old job in Tokyo\u2014waiting tables on a miserable income\u2014a serious option. \u25a0"}]}
