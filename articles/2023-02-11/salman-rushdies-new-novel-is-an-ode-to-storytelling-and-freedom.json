In its aftermath she reflects that, although \u201cterrible things happened\u201d, nonetheless \u201clife on earth was still bountiful, still plenteous, still good.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Salman had completed \u201cVictory City\u201d before he was stabbed by a jihadist on a stage in New York, losing an eye and full use of a hand. His book\u2019s joy in fictions that \u201ccould be as powerful as histories\u201d testifies to a lifetime of free-spirited invention. But its defiance and exuberance is poignant now that the author of \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children\u201d and \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d has narrowly avoided the fate decreed for him by an Iranian fatwa of 1989. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Sir Salman\u2019s stories, unfettered creativity rewrites the destinies laid down by dogma and law. \u201cVictory City\u201d is a fable about the power of narrative art, hitched to a historical chronicle. Pampa Kampana, the Indian storyteller-queen at its heart, believes that \u201cthe miraculous and the everyday are two halves of a single whole.\u201d Over four decades, that kinship has given Sir Salman his authorial signature."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pampa has been given a \u201ccursed gift of longevity\u201d and it grants her 247 years of life. She has other powers, too, and conjures the city and empire of Bisnaga into being by words alone. She directs its course over two centuries as queen consort, regent, minister and sorceress. In her realm of wonders, fairy-tale devices often drive the action, such as spells that turn humans into birds or talking forest animals."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Sir Salman makes Bisnaga \u201ca place with a history\u201d, not just \u201cthe invention of a witch\u201d. Its ascent, prosperity and decline track the real-world progress of the pluralistic Hindu empire of Vijayanagar (indeed Vijayanagar means \u201cvictory city\u201d). That kingdom flourished from the 1330s until Islamic invaders left it ruined after the Battle of Talikota in 1565. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pampa steers history, then records it in an epic poem. There was a princess-poet, Gangadevi, in the 14th century; some of Sir Salman\u2019s characters, such as Krishnadevaraya, a capricious king, bear the names of actual rulers. The green-eyed, red-haired Portuguese adventurers with whom Pampa has affairs, and who carry news of the empire overseas, have real counterparts. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "With its female progenitrix, Bisnaga becomes at its zenith a sort of feminist utopia. Its women are \u201cneither veiled nor hidden\u201d but honoured as warriors, \u201clawyers, traders, architects, poets, gurus, everything\u201d. Pampa and her more enlightened allies also battle sectarians and fundamentalists, welcoming \u201cunbelievers and other-believers\u201d to share their \u201creign of love\u201d. This may seem like wish-fulfilment, but Vijayanagar was noted for its tolerance and its influential women."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With history on one flank and fantasy on the other, Sir Salman gallops down the generations. Scenes of intrigue, exile, love and murder propel fast-flowing, wittily written chapters. Pampa learns, as writers must, that \u201conce you had created your characters, you had to be bound by their choices.\u201d Those choices are often unwise. \u201cGolden ages never last long\u201d: religious bigotry, palace plots and envious neighbours hasten Bisnaga\u2019s downfall into \u201crubble, blood and ash\u201d.
