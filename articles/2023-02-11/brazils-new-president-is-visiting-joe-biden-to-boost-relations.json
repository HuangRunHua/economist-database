Today that second role is occupied by China, which buys more than a quarter of Brazilian products. Last year Brazil\u2019s goods exports to China were worth a whopping $89bn. But Brazil\u2019s northern neighbour remains deeply important. On February 10th, after we went to press, Brazil\u2019s new leftist president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, was due to visit President Joe Biden in Washington. It will be the first international trip of this term outside Latin America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lula (as he is known) has said he wants to discuss, and presumably cement, Brazil\u2019s role \u201cin the new geopolitics\u201d with Mr Biden. But ensuring Brazil\u2019s place in the global order will be a trickier diplomatic feat than it was during his previous two terms as president, from 2003 to 2010. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For a start Lula needs to smooth relations in the wake of Jair Bolsonaro, his right-wing populist predecessor. Mr Bolsonaro, who was a fan of Donald Trump, did not destroy Brazil\u2019s relationship with the United States, but it became somewhat strained under the Biden administration. He was one of the last world leaders to acknowledge Mr Biden\u2019s victory in 2020, along with Vladimir Putin and Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico\u2019s president. Mr Bolsonaro did not care much what foreigners thought of Brazil. Under his watch, deforestation in the Amazon increased, earning him global condemnation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lula also faces a tricky balancing act. Brazilian diplomacy is typically neutral. Governments of both the left and the right have tried to stay out of big disputes. During his first two terms Lula tried to expand Brazil\u2019s global influence while remaining in America\u2019s good books. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2009 he helped give concrete form to the BRICS, a bloc of emerging economies. He opened 35 new embassies, mostly in Africa and Latin America. Even so, Lula had close relationships with presidents such as George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Mr Obama even quipped: \u201cLove this guy. He\u2019s the most popular politician on Earth.\u201d And the United States is the largest foreign investor in Brazil. Its flow of direct investment has held fairly steady in recent years. In 2021 it was $12bn, more than a quarter of all foreign direct investment in Brazil."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now that relations between China and the United States are more tense it may be harder for Lula to please both countries. In November Mr Biden announced that the US International Development Finance Corporation would invest $30m in TechMet, a mining company, to process cobalt and nickel in Brazil. This is an attempt to act as a counterweight to Chinese investors. His administration has also signalled that it will support Brazil\u2019s attempt to join the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, once its environmental policy is back on track. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "American foreign policy could also push Lula to take sides. In their meeting Mr Biden may try to convince the Brazilian to openly support Ukraine. In May last year Lula claimed that Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, was \u201cas responsible\u201d for the war as Mr Putin. Last month after a meeting with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, in Bras\u00edlia, the capital, Lula reluctantly conceded that the Russian president \u201cmade a mistake\u201d by invading Ukraine. But he refused to send ammunition to the country and criticised the European Union for not doing more to bring about peace talks. By contrast, when Mr Bolsonaro was in office, Brazil condemned Russia\u2019s invasion at the UN security council. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile Lula also faces problems at home. He won the election by a mere 1.8 percentage points. A week after Lula took charge, fans of Mr Bolsonaro stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace. Unrest could return. His government needs to pass tough economic reforms to ward off a fiscal crisis. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the past Lula has used foreign policy as a tool to burnish his popularity at home, says Rubens Ricupero, who was Brazil\u2019s ambassador in Washington in the 1990s. Lula is now planning to do one international trip a month; indeed, he is off to China in March. The trick might not work as well this time. \u25a0"}]}
