After his disastrous prescriptions for economic \u201cshock therapy\u201d in eastern Europe 30 years ago one would think he might want to sit this one out. His new idea is that countries such as Brazil and South Africa should be guarantors of a peace agreement, just as rich countries were supposed to guarantee the consequences from shock therapy. They didn\u2019t then and neutral countries won\u2019t now."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Sachs does not say how his idea could be implemented. By imposing penalties at the UN Security Council, where America, Russia and others have a veto? By military force?

As a result the efficacy of his argument is, once again, untestable."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most of us will be hard pressed to think of any conflict which was resolved by the assumption that a club of decent kids can somehow intermediate in a schoolyard brawl between big tough ones.

In the 1740s Britain\u2019s roadways were mostly muddy paths. Enterprising manufacturers, looking to transport raw materials into their factories and distribute the finished goods, formed joint-stock companies to dig canals linking navigable rivers throughout the countryside. It was a great success, and may possibly explain the first bump in your chart describing GDP per person. By the middle of the 1800s Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, London and other cities were connected by a rapid, smooth transport system.
