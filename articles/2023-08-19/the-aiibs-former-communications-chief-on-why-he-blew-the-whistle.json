It was soon dubbed \u201cChina\u2019s answer to the World Bank\u201d. But when the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) opened in 2016, press coverage quickly soured. Questions swirled about whether the Beijing-based bank was merely led by China or in thrall to its government. Some wondered if it would be an arm of Chinese statecraft, designed primarily to support the ballyhooed Belt and Road Initiative. Others questioned its claim to be an apolitical model of international governance, free from the clutches of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

AIIB\u2019s published governance structure, which stresses the bank\u2019s apolitical nature, allayed my concerns. I was also reassured by the list of shareholders, which included several Western democracies, including my own country, Canada. The bank\u2019s recruiters told me that AIIB was \u201cworld-class\u201d, a \u201cnew kind\u201d of multilateral development bank \u201cfor the 21st century\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It didn\u2019t take me long to realise that the reality did not match the messaging. Inside the bank, CCP members wield power in many key positions. Systemic surveillance breeds pervasive mutual suspicion, which smothers opinions that might differ from the party line."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I learned this during my first few weeks, when pandemic policy was discussed at an executive-committee meeting. I made what I felt was an uncontroversial comment, that there would be no stopping the Omicron variant of covid-19 in China, as elsewhere. As CCP apparatchiks looked on, I was upbraided by the AIIB\u2019s president, Jin Liqun, who recited the party\u2019s dogma about Mr Xi\u2019s zero-covid policies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On this and many other occasions, Mr Jin\u2014himself a CCP member\u2014would make a point of articulating Chinese government policy as if it were his own. As the bank\u2019s official spokesperson, I advised him that he should communicate his views as the leader of a multilateral organisation, and refrain from parroting the Chinese government\u2019s point of view."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I was taken aback when Mr Jin\u2019s right-hand man, a CCP stalwart, told me that \u201cyour job is to tell the president what to say and how to say it\u201d so that international audiences would not conclude that the bank represented China\u2019s interests. I subsequently discovered that Mr Jin\u2019s office was directly involved in crafting messaging for the domestic Chinese market\u2014for instance statements heaping praise on Mr Xi\u2014that differed from the bank\u2019s messaging in English. At one point Mr Jin himself told me to be mindful of \u201cthe party radicals\u201d (whom, it seemed, he found a constant irritant)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In my own department, a CCP member was assigned as my assistant, a role for which she was ill-suited. When I had her replaced I discovered that she had been secretly snitching directly to the most senior party member in Mr Jin\u2019s office. This arrangement was well outside the bank\u2019s supposed reporting lines."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2022 the CCP\u2019s presence in the president\u2019s office was bolstered by the arrival of a new colleague whose job description nobody seemed to know, except that he was, it was whispered, \u201cthe new party guy\u201d. Not long after, Mr Jin\u2019s office underwent a remodelling: security locks were installed, controlling the access of all AIIB staff.

No reason was given for this change."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This cocooning of the president caused much grumbling. Much of the information he receives and the issues he decides are filtered through the two AIIB officials whose offices are closest physically to his, inside this bubble. Both are reportedly party stalwarts. At the AIIB, nothing Mr Jin sees, says or does\u2014including, for example, his presence at the recent China-Central Asia Summit convened by Mr Xi\u2014happens without their involvement and guidance."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In one small but symbolic example of the AIIB\u2019s Sino-centricity, these advisers ordered the posting of a statement of condolence on the bank\u2019s website when Jiang Zemin, a former Chinese president, died in November 2022. This overruled the position of my department, which pointed out that despite AIIB having Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand as members, there had been no such notice after Queen Elizabeth\u2019s death in September."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A few months into my job, I was cautioned by expatriate colleagues in my own department about the CCP members inside the bank, and told not to \u201cmess\u201d with them. I was also warned not to trust any of the bank\u2019s information-technology channels and told that I had \u201cno idea\u201d how active the everyday surveillance could be. The IT department operated as if it were part of China\u2019s security apparatus. Once it cut off my remote internet connection when I was using a VPN while travelling in America. At the AIIB technology was often used to block communication rather than to enable it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To get big things done in the bank, such as funding the building of a multimedia studio, the cultivation of party members was essential. I would need to court them unrelentingly, pay them courtesy calls, take them to lunch and include them whenever possible in internal communication. I was hardly alone. There was a \u201csuck-up\u201d ethos, particularly to members in and around the president\u2019s office and the powerful facilities and administrative-services department."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Externally AIIB claims to be apolitical, but internally the atmosphere is anything but, and often toxic. Political strife is commonplace between departments, several of which are \u201cled\u201d by well-paid expatriates who serve as letterhead names and invariably rely on the connections and capability of their Chinese teams, many of which are run by CCP members close to Mr Jin."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At AIIB, obedience to the diktats of the president\u2019s office is valued more highly than any other virtue, including independent thinking or generating ideas. In this regard, this self-styled \u201cmodern\u201d multilateral institution functions more like a traditional Chinese bank. The mindset is more that of an imitator than an innovator: during my time at the bank the most common question asked on just about anything new was \u201cWhat is the World Bank doing?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "When I first resigned in May, citing my concerns about the CCP\u2019s influence and the potential need to share this information with my country, Mr Jin did not accept my resignation.

Then, after I shared my views more widely, Canada suspended its membership of the bank to review its participation (a process with which I have co-operated fully)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After accepting my resignation, the bank started attacking me personally. Journalists covering the news of my departure, some of whom I had known long before I joined the bank, told me that AIIB executives were trash-talking me off-the-record.

When I pointed to links between the accounts targeting me and those most vocally supportive of the AIIB, the caustic tweets abruptly halted. Chinese state-affiliated media have carried several opinion columns, with messaging remarkably similar to the AIIB\u2019s, calling my departure a \u201ctempest in a teapot\u201d.
