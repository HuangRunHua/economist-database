Firms were encouraged to go out into the world and learn from the West. More and more Chinese travelled and studied abroad.

The official job numbers for this group are so stubbornly awful that China recently stopped publishing them altogether. Higher education is no longer a reliable ladder to a solid career. Our calculations show that in 2021 over 70% of those unemployed youngsters were graduates. Along with scarce jobs, they face sky-high property prices. Their modest dreams of finding work, buying a house and supporting a family seem increasingly out of reach.

The idea was captured in \u201cA Love for Dilemma\u201d, a popular TV drama released in 2021. In the show, two characters liken the competition in educational attainment to an unruly audience at a cinema: someone stands up to get a clearer view, which obliges everyone behind them to stand.

Those born in the 1990s, by contrast, are the most downbeat.
