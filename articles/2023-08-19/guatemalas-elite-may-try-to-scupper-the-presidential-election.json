It was a glimmer of hope for the troubled Central American country. Mr Ar\u00e9valo, the son of Guatemala\u2019s first democratically elected president, is an outsider candidate who ran on an anti-corruption platform. But since then the country\u2019s elite has done its best to block Mr Ar\u00e9valo from the second round of the election, which takes place on August 20th."}, {"role": "body", "text": "By rights the presidency should be Mr Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s. He is polling 26 percentage points ahead of Sandra Torres, a former first lady to whom he came a close second in the first round. Along with promising to tackle corruption, Mr Ar\u00e9valo, of the progressive party Movimiento Semilla (Seed Movement), pledges to reduce poverty and improve health and education for the country\u2019s 17m people.

Their power has grown since 2019, when a UN-backed anti-corruption body was closed down by the then-president.

After Mr Ar\u00e9valos\u2019s surprise showing in the first round, nine mainstream parties alleged fraud, even though observers had seen no irregularities. The constitutional court ordered the electoral tribunal to review the vote count, delaying certification of the results. When this failed to lead to any change in the outcome, officials tried to suspend Semilla for allegedly forging signatures. (The constitutional court blocked the suspension, but the challenge is ongoing, as no party can be barred during an electoral period.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Attempts to use the judicial system to shape the election result are part of a pattern.

Others predict it will try to stop Mr Ar\u00e9valo taking power in January if he wins, possibly using a legal wrangle similar to the one in the first round. Recently a video surfaced showing an official from Ms Torres\u2019s party telling local officials to be ready to contest the results (Ms Torres denies any wrongdoing). This risks sparking protests and international condemnation. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much may depend on outside pressure. Marielos Chang of the University of Valle de Guatemala reckons the elite was unable to bar Mr Ar\u00e9valo from the second round because both Guatemalans and the international community reacted so strongly. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, and Luis Almagro, head of the Organisation of American States, a regional body, both condemned any attempts to interfere with the results. On July 23rd, in a review of corruption in the region, the US State Department banned a further ten Guatemalans from entering the United States.

Institutions could refuse to co-operate with Mr Ar\u00e9valo and stifle his agenda; people will get disillusioned with the lack of results from a candidate who promised change. What lies ahead is an uphill battle, says Ms Chang. But the potential reward justifies it. His win would ensure there are \u201ca few years more of life for democracy\u201d, she says. \u25a0"}], "id": 32}
