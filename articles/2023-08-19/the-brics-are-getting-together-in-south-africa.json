In 2001 Goldman Sachs coined the acronym BRIC in a paper about the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The quartet ran with the idea, holding its first summit in 2009. A year later South Africa was invited to join. Some analysts feared the BRICS might soon start to rival the G7, but the grouping quickly lost momentum. The non-Asian BRICS economies stagnated in the 2010s. At summits the bloc would issue garbled communiqu\u00e9s about the perfidious West\u2014which the perfidious West would promptly ignore. The BRICS looked dead. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And yet the bloc lives.

Vladimir Putin will not be there in person. Were he to attend, then South Africa, as a member of the International Criminal Court, would be obliged to act on the arrest warrant the court issued for Russia\u2019s president in March.

BRICS members, led by Beijing, are considering whether to expand and deepen the bloc. Some middle powers see the group as a possible vehicle for their interests. The bloc says that more than 40 countries have either applied to join it or have expressed an interest in doing so."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A \u201cBig BRICS\u201d would be a challenge for the West. But it is not a mortal threat. China\u2019s efforts to enlarge the bloc are revealing its tensions and contradictions. A weakened Russia is going along with it, but Brazil, India and South Africa are sceptical. The BRICS are far more heterogeneous than the G7. Members differ politically, economically and militarily; expansion would make a motley crew even motlier. It would mean that although the BRICS could criticise the Western-led international order with a louder voice, they would struggle even more to articulate an alternative. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "What, then, holds the BRICS together? Like the G7, the group has no charter or formal membership criteria. Nor is its mortar the product of personal chemistry. In June at a meeting of foreign ministers in Cape Town, a kind of warm-up for the main event, your correspondent snuck into the restaurant hosting the dignitaries\u2019 lunch. The pasta salad was not the shindig\u2019s only sad sight. The delegations were scattered: the Chinese were too busy in meetings, the South Africans too disorganised, the Brazilians too late. Outside, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India\u2019s foreign minister, held court with his officials. Inside, Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, silently nursed a glass of white wine.

One is to provide a platform for members to criticise, often with justification, the way institutions such as the World Bank, IMF and UN Security Council sideline the \u201cglobal south\u201d, a modish term for developing countries. In Cape Town Mr Jaishankar talked of the \u201cconcentration\u201d of global economic power that was \u201cleaving too many nations at the mercy of too few\u201d. Oddly, such views have become more pointed as the BRICS\u2019 share of world GDP has increased, from 8% in 2001 to 26% today.

Beijing wants to admit more countries from the global south. The reasoning is almost Newtonian: America\u2019s rallying of Western allies is prompting China into seeking an equal and opposite reaction via the BRICS. Viewed from China, there is no other bloc that could be a counterweight to the G7. The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation is too Eurasian. The G20 is too dominated by its Western members. The BRICS represent the best party going. A Chinese official contrasts Beijing\u2019s desire for a \u201cbig family\u201d of the BRICS countries with the West\u2019s \u201csmall circle\u201d.

On top of the annual summit of bigwigs there is an increasingly long list of meetings involving academics, firms, ministers, ruling parties and think-tanks from BRICS members and countries friendly to them. Some of these might look like excuses for per-diems. Last month a meeting of the \u201cBRICS youth summit\u201d was hosted by South Africa\u2019s 74-year-old youth minister. Russia says it will host a \u201cBRICS Games\u201d before the Paris Olympics next year.

It has established two financial institutions, which the Russian finance minister once reportedly described as a mini-IMF and a mini-World Bank.

It is an as yet untested series of swap lines for central banks to get hard currency if they have balance-of-payments problems."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The mini-World Bank is the New Development Bank (NDB).

The GDP per person of the poorest member, India, is roughly a fifth of that of China and Russia. The latter pair run current-account surpluses, the others deficits.

China actively manages the exchange rate of its currency; the other four intervene less often. And so on.

A common BRICS reserve currency\u2014something Mr Putin claimed the bloc was working on a year ago\u2014would collapse on first contact with reality; no member would give up the power held by their central bank. Members regularly guard their own power at economic institutions. South Africa\u2019s efforts to have more African representation on the IMF board have been rejected. China has around 40% of the voting rights at the CRA, in line with its capital contribution, and insisted on a limit to what any country can receive in the absence of an IMF programme.

The World Bank is more transparent and accountable than the NDB, notes Daniel Bradlow of the University of Pretoria in South Africa. That the NDB mostly issues loans in US dollars or euros somewhat undermines its members\u2019 claim to be trying to reduce the power of the greenback. A rule ensures that the five original members retain 55% of voting rights, belying their criticisms of uneven decision-making power at the World Bank and the IMF. \u201cThat does not suggest a truly progressive global-south bank,\u201d says Mr Bradlow."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Politically, too, they are an eclectic bunch.
