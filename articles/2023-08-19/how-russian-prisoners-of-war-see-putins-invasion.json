After Russian soldiers are captured, they move through a series of detention centres before arriving at this PoW camp. Visitors are asked not to reveal its exact location. Arrival here means that being exchanged is the probable next step, unless interrogation by Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services implicates the PoW in a war crime. Some prisoners ask the Ukrainian authorities to delay their exchange until after their military contracts have expired so that they are not compelled to fight again. A few ask not to be returned at all; but then they have to remain in custody until the war is over, unless they volunteer to fight in the anti-Putin Russian militia that Ukraine sponsors.

It refuses however to divulge whether one side or the other gave more access."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Lviv camp is a model one. In accordance with the Geneva Conventions, the PoWs are not locked up in cells. Krzysztof Janowski of the UN\u2019s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) says that conditions in the camp have \u201cnot raised any major issues with us in the past,\u201d and \u201care consistently improving over time.\u201d As allowed by the conventions, ordinary soldiers are put to work. In one room men sit around a table sticking and glueing fancy shopping bags. They also make garden furniture. Officers are not compelled to work but they are \u201crare birds\u201d here, says Petro Yatsenko, a novelist turned spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s Co-ordination Headquarters for the Treatment of PoWs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to Mr Yatsenko, the types of prisoners passing through the camp have varied. When the 2022 invasion began, the arrivals were mostly soldiers from Donetsk and Luhansk, the two territories of Ukraine which came under Russian control in 2014. In the second wave there were a lot of mercenaries from the Wagner group. Now he says, roughly one-third of the PoWs are jailbirds like Andrey, who were recruited into so-called Storm-Z penal military units, a third are men who have been mobilised, and a third are regular soldiers. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the Lviv camp many of the Russian PoWs look far older than their years. Many of those recruited from prison have been ill and weak and \u201cit is very difficult to believe they can have been useful except as artillery meat,\u201d says Mr Yatsenko. The Russian army began recruiting in prisons early in the year as its relations with the Wagner group deteriorated. But he says that it seems that Wagner had already taken the fittest prisoners. He says most Russian PoWs spend on average \u201cmonths\u201d in Ukraine, but many Ukrainians coming back from Russia have been there for more than a year. Up to a third of the Ukrainians who return have been registered as missing because Russia shares no information with Ukraine about its prisoners."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In March the OHCHR published a searing report on PoWs. Its teams had full access to detention centres in Ukraine, but none to any in Russia or the occupied territories. Its information on conditions of prisoners in Russian hands came from freed prisoners. Based on several hundred interviews it found that 92% of those who had been prisoners of the Russians claimed to have been ill-treated or tortured, whereas that figure was 49% (which is still alarmingly high) for PoWs held by Ukraine. According to Mr Despres, the moment of the highest risk of abuse comes typically \u201cin the first hours after they have been captured.\u201d According to Mr Janowski \u201con the Russian side the mistreatment continues throughout their detention.\u201d That appears to be much less true for Russian PoWs in Ukraine. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the Lviv camp most of the PoWs that were asked said they had not been mistreated\u2014but Ukrainian officials were around, if not present, at every discussion. A couple of men looked down and said this was not something they wanted to talk about. The treatment of some PoWs by both countries upon capture, including the reported summary execution of 15 Ukrainians and 25 Russian PoWs \u201cmay constitute war crimes,\u201d says the UN report. Russian officials \u201cessentially dismiss our findings\u201d says Mr Janowski while the Ukrainian side has been \u201cresponsive, accepting our role as independent monitors.\u201d Even so the report records a depressing amount of mistreatment by the Ukrainians. \u201cThe majority of tortured and ill-treated PoWs complained of beatings with rifle butts, wooden bats, sticks and fists \u2026 and being forced to kneel for hours while being questioned,\u201d it said. It also noted a \u201cwidespread pattern\u201d of prisoners being forced on film to shout and sing slogans, and that videos of ill treatment and humiliation were \u201cdisseminated on social media.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Ukraine PoWs are allowed occasional calls home, though they are not private.
