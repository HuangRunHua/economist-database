Now a version of it could be used to nail a former president after a grand jury in Georgia indicted Donald Trump, along with 18 of his associates, on August 14th. What are RICO charges and how might they apply to Mr Trump?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Congress first passed the legislation in 1970 while trying to target the Italian-American mafia. In America, you cannot be prosecuted for simply being a mobster; that constitutes a \u201cstatus crime\u201d, and the Eighth Amendment protects against it. And, as anyone who has seen \u201cThe Godfather\u201d knows, the more powerful a crime boss is, the less likely they are to be the one actually getting their hands dirty. To get around this problem, lawmakers developed RICO, a broad statute allowing prosecutors to charge members of a long-running enterprise for their patterns of behaviour and connections to the organisation. Some active involvement is still necessary: the prosecution must prove that the accused committed two out of thirty-five possible offences, ranging from murder and kidnapping to bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice. Defendants face up to 20 years in prison if convicted."}, {"role": "body", "text": "RICO worked, contributing significantly to the sharp decline of organised crime in America in recent decades. The bosses of the five major mafia families in New York, for example, were all felled by RICO charges between the late 1980s and early 2000s. And it is not only useful against those at the top. In 2021 federal prosecutors in Brooklyn brought RICO charges against the Colombo crime family, a mafia entity. The breadth of the legislation allowed prosecutors to levy racketeering charges against the boss and many of his underlings simultaneously. That let them shut down the enterprise quickly rather than having to painstakingly peel off individuals. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Over time, prosecutors began targeting enterprises beyond the mob. In the late 1980s Rudy Giuliani\u2014then Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor, having spearheaded the state\u2019s mob-boss takedown\u2014rocked Wall Street when he threatened two swanky investment firms with RICO indictments. (Mr Giuliani\u2019s pioneering use of RICO-style laws feels ironic now that he is one of Mr Trump\u2019s co-defendants in Georgia.) The threat of the law\u2019s stiff penalties forced one firm to settle on lesser charges; the other collapsed after spooked investors fled. In 2020 New York\u2019s Eastern District used RICO to hand down a 120-year prison sentence to the leader of \u201cNXIVM\u201d, a cult that forced women and teenagers to become sex \u201cslaves\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "More than 30 states have their own versions of RICO laws. But the Georgia statute is particularly broad: it includes many types of crime and is lax on how longstanding an enterprise\u2019s activities must be. That scope has allowed lawyers in the state to experiment with new applications of the legislation\u2014most notably Fani Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County responsible for the case against Mr Trump. Ms Willis has previously used the statute against teachers who conspired to inflate students\u2019 scores in state exams, and rappers associated with the same record label for facilitating criminal gang activity. In both cases, the charges brought by Ms Willis helped define the targeted enterprise in ways others had not done before."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She has done something similar with Mr Trump, positioning him as the kingpin of an enterprise that conspired to \u201cunlawfully change the outcome\u201d of the 2020 presidential election. The case accuses Mr Trump and 18 co-conspirators\u2014a collection of lawyers including Mr Giuliani and politicians including Mark Meadows, Mr Trump\u2019s former chief of staff\u2014of operating in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan and elsewhere \u201cfor a period of time sufficient\u201d for the group to \u201cpursue its objectives\u201d, which it claims include defrauding the state, committing perjury, forgery, and theft. (Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani have denied wrongdoing.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The 19 accused have until August 25th to appear before the court in Atlanta. Unlike the federal act, Georgia\u2019s version of RICO carries a minimum sentence (an undesirable five years), which might compel Mr Trump\u2019s co-defendants to settle and co-operate rather than risk prison time. The outcome will be watched closely. Alan Dershowitz, a former law professor, once derided RICO\u2019s expansive powers as a \u201ccheap\u201d attempt by lawmakers to use \u201cone statute to solve all the evils of society\u201d. Many opponents of Mr Trump will be hoping that criticism proves true. \u25a0"}], "id": 74}
