But the movie is already a hit for a firm in another industry. Herbert Johnson, a 134-year-old London hatmaker, is fielding soaring demand for a certain fedora."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s been just glorious,\u201d says Michelle Poyer-Sleeman, the master hatter who designed the latest iteration of the Poet, the hat first donned by Harrison Ford in \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d in 1981. The firm had to keep the product under its hat until a couple of weeks before the movie\u2019s launch. But already the \u201cDestiny Poet\u201d has caused a seven-fold rise in Herbert Johnson\u2019s revenue since June last year. A backlog of over 300 orders waits to be handmade in a workshop that hums with the sound of fans, steam and irons."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The boom marks a sharp turnaround for the firm. After the success of \u201cRaiders\u201d it provided Indy\u2019s hats in the follow-ups, \u201cTemple of Doom\u201d (1984) and \u201cLast Crusade\u201d (1989). But a downturn in hat-wearing brought hard times. Venerable hatters such as Italy\u2019s Borsalino went bust. Herbert Johnson was sold and for a while stopped making its hats in-house. For \u201cKingdom of the Crystal Skull\u201d, Indy\u2019s fourth adventure, in 2008, the producers went elsewhere."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After a rethink in 2016 the firm went back to handmaking and focused on the Poet, which today accounts for three-quarters of sales. The internet brought new customers, many of them American (and many women). Customers wait up to six months for their \u00a3495 ($630) rabbit-felt Poet, which comes with an optional \u201cRaiders turn\u201d, a 25-degree twist of the crown to match the jaunty angle at which Mr Ford wore his (supposedly to keep it on during stunts). The firm advises keeping it out of heavy rain and heat and to brush it only anticlockwise. Dr Jones would surely scoff."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Swaine, the 273-year-old luxury-goods firm that owns Herbert Johnson, hopes for success with other on-screen products. It sells a \u00a3520 umbrella of the sort twirled by Gene Kelly in \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d and a \u00a33,200 attach\u00e9 case used by James Bond in \u201cFrom Russia with Love\u201d (minus the concealed knife). In March it opened a new flagship shop. Hat-wearing is making a comeback, says Ms Poyer-Sleeman, who spotted several clients at the \u201cDial of Destiny\u201d premiere. There is also a \u201cswing back to quality\u201d, she says. People want something that will last, \u201cand we\u2019re in that niche.\u201d\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 48}
