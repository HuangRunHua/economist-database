Sir Simon Gass was the chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee (jic), a role he held for over four years until retiring on June 28th. His team had hotly debated the question, he tells The Economist. \u201cWe produced, in one month, twice as much product as we\u2019d produced in a previous year.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The forewarning of Russia\u2019s invasion was an intelligence coup for both America and Britain: arguably the most striking one since spies revealed that Soviet missiles had been placed in Cuba in 1962. It was as much about assessment as raw material, suggests Sir Simon. Weeks before the attack, his team judged that an invasion was \u201chighly likely\u201d, a term which denotes 80-90% probability, in the language of intelligence analysis. France, Germany and other allies saw much of the same intel\u2014though not every detail\u2014but thought Mr Putin was bluffing. Sceptics \u201ccouldn\u2019t get past [the idea] that he wouldn\u2019t do something so stupid and destructive\u201d, says Sir Simon. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The jic is a curiosity. America has 17 intelligence agencies. Each one does in-house analysis, so assessments from over the Atlantic can be a cacophony: a recent report on the origins of covid-19 is filled with dissenting views of rival agencies. British spooks gather secrets but do not formally analyse them. Instead the jic, with a small team of analysts, convenes agencies and departments to hash out an agreed position in collegiate fashion."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The system failed disastrously in 2002-03 when the jic, under pressure from Downing Street, produced faulty assessments about Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. That led to wholesale reforms, including professional training for analysts and more emphasis on dissenting views. The jic chair now tends to be someone at the end of their career who is thus in a stronger position to speak truth to power. Sir Simon says he occasionally had to deliver \u201cpretty unwelcome\u201d assessments to ministers. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt myself put under inappropriate pressure.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "One challenge for the jic is the rise of open-source intelligence, or osint. Consider Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s march towards Moscow on June 24th. Russian military bloggers documented the insurrection in real time. Plane-tracking websites showed Mr Prigozhin\u2019s subsequent exile to Belarus. Analysts are now using commercial satellite images to look for his troops\u2019 encampments there. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Is a jic still needed if ministers can get the bulk of their news from Twitter and Telegram? \u201cThe sheer quantity of high-class open source presents a problem for policymakers in its own right,\u201d says Sir Simon. \u201cThey can\u2019t read everything\u2026even if all you\u2019re doing is distilling it down into a story for them, that in itself is important.\u201d Even open sources must be scrutinised by trained analysts. Technology is also helping to harness the deluge of data. A new cloud-based platform, index, lets users access analysis from within the government and beyond. It uses natural-language processing, a form of artificial intelligence, to summarise documents and extract key information. \u201cWe\u2019re in the foothills of this,\u201d says Sir Simon, \u201cbut more is coming.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Britain\u2019s pre-invasion intel was notable not only for its prescience, but also its public profile. America and Britain released highly classified material to expose Mr Putin\u2019s plans. Is this a model for the future? Declassified secrets must be \u201ca fair reflection of what\u2019s happening on the ground\u201d, warns Sir Simon, not just cherry-picked detail. They must also be used sparingly, only when the impact is \u201ctruly consequential\u201d, as it was last year. \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, it rather cheapens the brand and loses the effect.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not every judgment has been as successful as Ukraine. \u201cWe did not foresee, for example, the speed at which the Taliban took over in Afghanistan,\u201d admits Sir Simon. \u201cHaving spoken to the Taliban,\u201d he adds, \u201cneither did they.\u201d But an enduring lesson from these crises, he says, is that those weighing up intelligence, often ambiguous and fragmentary, need to have \u201canalytical courage\u201d in stating a conclusion. \u201cPoor analysis tends to march the leader up the hill, and then leave them there to draw their own conclusion.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
