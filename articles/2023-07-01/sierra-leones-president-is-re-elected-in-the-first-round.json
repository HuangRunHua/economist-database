For more than 15 years National Election Watch (new), a coalition of civil-society organisations, has produced a tally of results based on a representative sample of polling stations. In the previous three elections, its results matched the official ones. Not this time. It reckons Mr Bio scored about 50%. The electoral commission also reported a voter turnout that was well above new\u2018s estimates. More worryingly, it reckons that in some districts there were more votes cast than there were registered voters. Foreign observers also raised concerns about transparency."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sierra Leone, a country of 8.4m people, has been widely seen as a success after its 11-year civil war ended in 2002.
