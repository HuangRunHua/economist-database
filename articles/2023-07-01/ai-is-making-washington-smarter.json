Legislators and regulators are trying hard to come to grips with the protean technology. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has been holding senators-only briefings with experts to educate his chamber.

Given Congress\u2019s reputation for speed and technological literacy (the Senate was in session for all of 14 days in June, and Mr Schumer uses a flip phone), the jokes write themselves, almost. ChatGPT\u2019s first, unfunny stab reflected the cynicism any sentient being might feel: \u201cWhy did the AI refuse to testify before Congress? Because it didn\u2019t want to be caught in a loop of lawmakers asking the same question over and over.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Americans should bask in this rare season, while it lasts, of good-faith searching and head-scratching. Not only are the regulators interrogating themselves about where and how they should regulate, the industry itself is asking to be regulated, up to a point. Even if it is all doomed to end in partisan impasse and recrimination, now is the time to ask: how could Washington get this right? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One danger is that lawmakers could wind up bickering over a problem they can address only at the edges. Representatives of both parties regret not more aggressively regulating the internet in general and social media in particular. Being politicians, they are alert to how political actors are already using AI tools to generate political messages, including fabricated images. For their part journalists, being journalists, are obsessed with AI\u2019s potential to create and spread lies. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These are serious concerns. But because of America\u2019s speech protections, congressional action would probably be less constructive than voluntary standards by campaigns, technical approaches by the private sector to authenticate images and scepticism from a jaded electorate. The more Congress focuses on the flow of information, the more it will be riven by fights over whether a particular chatbot is inclined to disparage one party or another. \u201cIf we get drawn into refighting the social-media wars, we risk not realising the promise of machine learning,\u201d warns Kent Walker, the president of global affairs at Google and Alphabet. \u201cSocial media isn\u2019t going to cure cancer, but AI has the potential to, and it would be a shame if that promise were politicised. It would be a shame to hold back progress in nuclear fusion because we can\u2019t agree about Twitter.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A better starting point would be to recognise that the government is already regulating AI. Years ago it set the nerve ends tingling of the federal bureaucracy, another complex, amorphous entity that somehow translates countless inputs into answers that cannot always be explained. Plenty of laws already cover the use of AI. And questions about AI\u2019s use in providing health care, hiring people, driving cars or investing are being asked and answered, albeit too slowly for some industries. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, part of the Commerce Department, has drawn up voluntary standards by which AI might be governed.

Nor are the technology companies, but, in the face of AI, they are embracing it, too.
