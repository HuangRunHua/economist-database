She is the favourite among the 14 contenders to win a primary vote among supporters of opposition parties. That is scheduled for October 22nd; 57% of likely voters back her, according to Poder y Estrategia, a polling company.

Nearly a quarter of the population\u2014some 7m people\u2014have left Venezuela. But the vote is likely to be dodgy. Venezuela last held a national election with a legitimate result in 2015, when the opposition won control of the National Assembly. The Maduro regime stripped the legislature of its powers. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Machado, who is renowned for her firebrand style, is on the rightward end of the opposition\u2019s political spectrum. In an interview with The Economist in Caracas she named Margaret Thatcher as the politician she most admires. Despite the odds against her, she insists that the battle for democracy is not yet lost. Although she has strong reservations about taking part in any election overseen by the regime, the primary \u201ccould be the catalyst\u201d for change, she says. It will be a chance for voters to shout \u201cno\u201d to Mr Maduro, rattling his government and reminding other countries that Venezuelans still want democracy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Machado comes to the fight with advantages. She once personally confronted Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who initiated Venezuela\u2019s economic and democratic decline and named Mr Maduro his successor as president. In 2012, while Ch\u00e1vez was in the midst of a nine-hour speech to the legislature, she interrupted to denounce as \u201ctheft\u201d his expropriation of businesses (among them, a steel mill owned by her family). Irritated, Ch\u00e1vez tried to put the young congresswoman in her place. \u201cEagles don\u2019t hunt flies,\u201d he boomed, backed by a chorus of jeers from his lackeys. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Machado played no formal part in the failed \u201cinterim government\u201d of Juan Guaid\u00f3. That should help her now. In 2019 the United States, the European Union and dozens of other nations recognised Mr Guaid\u00f3, who was head of the legislature, as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president, but he never came close to achieving power. The project ended in January this year, when the opposition voted to dissolve his non-government. Mr Guaid\u00f3 is now in the United States. Ms Machado, who backed American sanctions on the Maduro regime, \u201cnow has a monopoly of the more radical sector of the opposition\u201d, says Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, a pollster based in Caracas.

Once the most profitable major oil company in the world, it has been brought low by corruption and mismanagement under Ch\u00e1vez and Mr Maduro. But her declared rivals in the primaries doubt that privatisation is the answer. \u201cOil belongs to the people,\u201d declares Henrique Capriles, a former state governor who has twice run for the presidency and, like Ms Machado, hopes to be the opposition\u2019s nominee this time. Venezuelans should not assume that \u201ceverything public is bad and everything private is good\u201d. Ms Machado disagrees.

Her three children live abroad, but the regime has barred her since 2014 from leaving the country. Many other families have been divided by the exodus of recent years. \u201cWe all just want to have our families back together,\u201d she says.

If Ms Machado is his opponent, his reluctance will deepen. She has repeatedly called for the dictator and his entourage to be put on trial.
