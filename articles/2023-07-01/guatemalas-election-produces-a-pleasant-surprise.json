For unconvincing reasons the electoral tribunal banned three popular presidential candidates from running. A court jailed Jos\u00e9 Rub\u00e9n Zamora, a prominent investigative journalist. So it was a pleasant surprise for many Guatemalans when an outsider defied the polls to come a close second to a candidate who was backed by the country\u2019s ruling elite. Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo of Semilla (Seed), a young progressive party, won a place in the run-off in August by getting 12% of the vote. He has a real chance of becoming the country\u2019s next leader."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The vote for Mr Ar\u00e9valo, who is 64, is a sign of thirst for change in a country where corruption is widespread and standards of democracy are sinking. (More voters left their ballots blank or spoiled them than voted for any single candidate, a sign of their discontent.) Mr Ar\u00e9valo trailed behind Sandra Torres, a former first lady, by only four percentage points. He also beat other candidates favoured by the political, military and business elites, which Guatemalans damn as \u201cthe pact of the corrupt\u201d. Semilla increased its number of lawmakers in Congress from seven to 23, making it the third-biggest party."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The surprise result offers a glimmer of hope in a despairing region. Many of Guatemala\u2019s neighbours are dictatorships or on their way to becoming one. Daniel Ortega has crushed opposition in Nicaragua. In El Salvador Nayib Bukele has taken control of all three branches of the state, and has convinced Salvadoreans to praise him for it. On June 26th his party said he would run for re-election, even though the constitution appears to forbid that. Many of Honduras\u2019s leading politicians are thought to be corrupt and some have been in league with drug-traffickers and other criminals. Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, the country\u2019s president until last year, was extradited to the United States to face drug-trafficking charges. (He has pleaded not guilty.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Guatemala has gone downhill, especially since 2019, when Jimmy Morales, then the president, closed down CICIG, a un-backed anti-corruption body. Under Alejandro Giammattei, the current president, the courts have been politicised and anonymous threats have forced scores of independent-minded judges and journalists out of the country. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Ar\u00e9valo, by contrast, has strong democratic credentials. The son of the first democratically elected president, who held office between 1945 and 1951, he has promised to bring greater openness, to fight corruption and to spend more money on education and health to reduce poverty. The World Bank estimates that more than half of Guatemalans live below the national poverty line. Ms Torres promises much the same, but does not look like change to most Guatemalans. Her disapproval rating is far higher than Mr Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The widespread discontent in Guatemala suggests that an anti-establishment candidate like Mr Ar\u00e9valo should be the favourite to win in the second round. But his foes will make it hard. Support for Semilla, whose candidate in 2019, a former attorney-general, was barred from running, began among young people. They in turn persuaded their parents and grandparents to vote for the party."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the ruling elites are \u201ca formidable enemy\u201d that will do \u201ceven the unthinkable\u201d to defeat Mr Ar\u00e9valo, says Ricardo S\u00e1enz of San Carlos University in Guatemala City. Voices have already started whispering on social media and elsewhere that Mr Ar\u00e9valo is a communist who will nationalise businesses. (There is no evidence of that.) Dirtier tricks are likely to follow. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Guatemala has been on the verge of change before, only to be disappointed. In 2015 thousands of Guatemalans celebrated when Otto P\u00e9rez Molina resigned from the presidency after CICIG presented evidence of corruption against him. Then came Mr Morales. This time there is no UN-backed body to help. But Semilla is hopeful. The elites \u201cthought that having control of the state, courts and public prosecutor would be enough\u201d, says Samuel P\u00e9rez, a Semilla lawmaker. \u201cBut they forgot that the will of the people matters too.\u201d \u25a0"}], "id": 31}
