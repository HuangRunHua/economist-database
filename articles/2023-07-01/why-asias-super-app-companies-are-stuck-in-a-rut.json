Collectively, the market capitalisation of Singapore\u2019s Sea and Grab, South Korea\u2019s Coupang and Kakao, Japan\u2019s Rakuten, and the parent company of India\u2019s Paytm has declined by around 60% since the end of 2021. None of the firms is the same; they each make money from a blend of mobile gaming, social media, e-commerce, ride-sharing and financial payments. What they have in common is an aspiration to bundle together a variety of services which complement one another on one app. They had hoped hoping to emulate Chinese companies, such as Tencent\u2019s WeChat and Alibaba\u2019s Alipay, which pioneered the business model."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the newer Asian super-apps have been put under huge pressure by a rapidly changing environment. Funding, which was once cheap and plentiful, has dried up, making ambitious growth plans harder to finance. James Lloyd at Citigroup, a bank, notes that China\u2019s super-apps started with a core of profitable and engaging businesses (e-commerce for Alipay and social media in the case of WeChat), which other services were built around. Outside China, few firms have balanced both significant scale and earnings in a similar way."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kakao, a South Korean firm, most closely fits the bill. Unlike most Asian would-be super-apps, it has been reliably profitable. Yet its share price has declined by 8% this year. Because the company is dominant on its home turf, it is running out of room for further domestic growth. Its ride-hailing arm has a market share in South Korea of as much as 90%, by some estimates. The firm wants to raise the international share of its revenues from 10% today to 30% by 2025\u2014but such global expansion comes at a cost. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At other firms the funding squeeze has inspired ambitions for profitability, which inevitably comes at the expense of previous plans for rapid expansion. GoTo, an Indonesian super-app, created from the merger of Gojek, a ride-hailing company, and Tokopedia, an e-commerce firm, was expected to appoint a former banker, Patrick Walujo, as CEO at its shareholder meeting on June 30th, after we published this. Mr Walujo has stressed that his aim is to make the company profitable."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One Asian consumer-tech firm has bucked this year\u2019s trend. The share price of Paytm, a would-be Indian super-app based around digital payments, has rallied by around 60%. The stock is still less than half of its all-time high, reached shortly after it floated in November 2021, and the firm has yet to make a profit. Nonetheless, its rising share price may reflect something companies elsewhere in Asia lack: a single, large and growing domestic market to work with. Whether that potential for scale proves enough for a more sustainable future for Paytm has yet to be seen. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The idea of a company using a single platform to offer a variety of services to consumers has an intuitive appeal. But after more than a decade of discussion about the coming dominance of super-apps, many of the Asian firms are still struggling to find a balance between size and profitability. With no end in sight to higher funding costs, a speedy recovery for these one-time darlings of tech investors is hard to foresee. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 45}
