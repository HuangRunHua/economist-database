Citing the \u201cindependent state legislature\u201d theory, they sought to block state-court rulings in Pennsylvania and elsewhere that made voting easier during the covid-19 pandemic by, for instance, extending deadlines for mail-in ballots. And after election day, legal advisers drew on the notion in cooking up a radical scheme to replace electors in states won by Joe Biden with \u201calternative\u201d slates for Mr Trump."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On June 27th, in Moore v Harper, the Supreme Court threw cold water on the theory behind these moves: the idea that state legislatures have near-absolute authority, unchecked by state courts, to set the terms of federal elections. As part of an end-of-term rush for the court\u2014several big cases remained to be decided by June 30th, including the fate of affirmative action in university admissions and Mr Biden\u2019s student-debt-relief plan\u2014John Roberts, the chief justice, wrote for the three liberal justices (Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor) and two of Mr Trump\u2019s picks (Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh). Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent that was joined in part by Samuel Alito and in full by Neil Gorsuch."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Moore began in North Carolina. In 2021 the state\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature drew an electoral map giving Republicans the upper hand in ten of the state\u2019s 14 seats in the House of Representatives. Given the state\u2019s near-even split between Republicans and Democrats, North Carolina\u2019s Supreme Court found this aggressive gerrymander inconsistent with a guarantee in North Carolina\u2019s constitution that all elections \u201cshall be free\u201d. It ordered experts to redraw the district lines. In 2022, using a fairer map, Republicans and Democrats won seven seats apiece. But Republican legislators balked, saying the federal constitution should have stopped the North Carolina Supreme Court from interfering."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The hook for their complaint appears in Article I of the constitution, which says that the \u201ctimes, places and manner of holding elections\u201d for Congress \u201cshall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof\u201d. North Carolina Republicans argued this means no state entity may constrain a state legislature performing the \u201cfederal function\u201d of election regulation. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chief Justice Roberts roundly rejected this contention. \u201cSince early in our nation\u2019s history\u201d, he wrote, \u201ccourts have recognised their duty to evaluate the constitutionality of legislative acts.\u201d The federal constitution might empower state legislatures to make laws governing elections, but it \u201cdoes not insulate state legislatures from the ordinary exercise of state judicial review\u201d. Citing Supreme Court decisions stretching back more than a century, the chief justice explained how legislatures have never been autonomous actors when it comes to election law. \u201cThe reasoning we unanimously embraced\u201d in a 1932 case, he wrote, \u201ccommands our continued respect.\u201d State legislators \u201cmay not \u2018create congressional districts independently of\u2019 requirements imposed \u2018by the state constitution with respect to the enactment of laws\u2019.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Just eight years ago, the Supreme Court decided that Arizona\u2019s voters were authorised to outsource the legislature\u2019s redistricting tasks to an independent commission.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In his dissent, Justice Thomas argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider Moore because the North Carolina Supreme Court (after recently gaining a Republican majority) has reversed its ruling on the constitutionality of the warped map. The case is \u201cindisputably moot\u201d, he wrote. But the longest-serving and most conservative justice on the court also rejected the majority\u2019s reasoning on the merits. The court \u201coffers no clear rationale for its interpretation\u201d of the salient constitutional clause. \u201cI worry that today\u2019s opinion\u201d, Justice Thomas warned, \u201cportends serious troubles ahead for the judiciary.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some observers on the left think Justice Thomas may have a point. In rejecting full autonomy for state legislatures, Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s opinion also denies state courts complete deference from federal courts. Without laying out a standard, the majority holds that state judges may not \u201cunconstitutionally intrude upon the role specifically reserved to state legislatures\u201d. There are limits, in other words, to what state courts can do when policing state legislatures\u2019 handiwork with elections\u2014and federal courts will keep watch. From the right, Justice Thomas is concerned that the ensuing uncertainty will give federal judges little direction in \u201csome of the most politically acrimonious and fast-moving cases\u201d. From the left, Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, worries that it \u201csets up a Supreme Court power-grab down the line\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But these fears may be overstated. All three of the lawyers arguing against the independent state legislature theory last winter acknowledged that federal courts may need to step in to correct egregious errors in state-court decisions. And judging by the strong affirmation of the role of state courts in Moore, the six-justice majority does not seem inclined to enter the fray idly. After taking a stand against racial discrimination in redistricting earlier this month, the Supreme Court has again stood up against a subversion of democracy. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 23}
