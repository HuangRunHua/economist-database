To hear scholars in Beijing tell it, China is not the country in need of lessons. Instead, it is for Russia to study China\u2019s good example. Specifically, Vladimir Putin should learn from the wisdom of China\u2019s Communist Party founders, who imposed strict, top-down political control over armed fighters from the earliest days of the revolution. They cite Chairman Mao Zedong\u2019s dictum: \u201cThe party commands the gun, the gun must never be allowed to command the party.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "That tone of complacency might surprise some in the West. Logic would suggest that turbulence in Russia should provoke a crisis of self-doubt in the corridors of Chinese power. After all, just days before Mr Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian leader secured a written agreement offering friendship \u201cwithout limits\u201d from his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Even as Russian troops and mercenaries commit atrocities in Ukraine, China\u2019s diplomats and propagandists have stuck to an unvarying script: namely, that the war is the fault of West, which pushed Russia into a corner by expanding the NATO alliance, and is being prolonged with weapons supplied for the profit of American arms dealers. They have hewed to those pro-Russian talking points even as they undermine China\u2019s image in many Western capitals, notably in Europe."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Spurning all calls to condemn the invasion, Mr Xi has stood by Mr Putin personally. On a state visit to Moscow in March, China\u2019s leader paused at the Kremlin\u2019s doors and allowed cameras to record him calling Mr Putin his \u201cdear friend\u201d, before telling him: \u201cRight now there are changes, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen for 100 years, and we should drive those changes together.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today, Mr Xi\u2019s bet on Mr Putin looks riskier than before. Yet if outsiders expect to hear Chinese leaders fretting openly about backing a loser, they fail to grasp the nature of the two leaders\u2019 bond. The rulers of China and Russia are united, powerfully, by contempt for the West and its liberal, democratic norms. Their words reveal a shared conviction that an older, bleaker world order\u2014based on balancing the interests of individual states, with special deference paid to great powers\u2014is coming back. Each country brings very different tools and techniques to that fight. In China, officials and scholars agree, semi-publicly, that Russia can be a reckless and sometimes alarming friend. But they also call this struggle for dominance a long one. What matters is that the West should be driven from the global centre-stage in the end."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the past few days, censors and propaganda chiefs allowed the Chinese public to receive relatively unfiltered reports about the Wagner Group\u2019s mutiny. While official media issued careful reports calling the crisis an internal affair of Russia, online news outlets and commentators were less cautious. Censors let them repost and debate video statements by the mercenary group\u2019s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, alleging corruption in Russia\u2019s high command. Netizens compared him to sundry Chinese rebels from antiquity (An Lushan, a treacherous eighth-century general, was a popular choice). Such relative openness may signal China giving itself room for manoeuvre, should Mr Putin\u2019s woes continue. Most simply, it seems to show a lack of panic at the top in Beijing."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s confidence should be enhanced by recent events, suggests Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) now at the Centre for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University. He recalls how Mao imposed party cells and commissars on the Red Army when it was a band of ragtag guerrillas, and praises the modern PLA for maintaining this \u201cfine\u201d tradition. \u201cMaybe what happened in Russia just proves to China\u2019s leadership that what we do is right,\u201d says Mr Zhou. It suited Russia to use mercenaries to project power overseas, or the Wagner Group would have been reined in sooner, he ventures, just as it suited America to use armed contractors from firms like Blackwater in Iraq, or Britain\u2019s East India Company to build an empire with for-profit troops. But such outsourcing would never be tolerated in China. Nor would the PLA ever recruit convicts from prison as the Wagner Group did, \u201cno matter how brave\u201d, he says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "China does use private security companies to guard its nationals working abroad, concedes Mr Zhou, a former PLA liaison officer to international anti-piracy patrols off the Horn of Africa. But, he adds, this is because the Belt and Road Initiative, a vast infrastructure scheme, takes Chinese firms to dangerous places."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Good friends, different business models"}, {"role": "body", "text": "China is not averse to using civilians to perform ambiguous, quasi-military tasks. Fishermen aboard large, steel-hulled ships are sometimes called up as a state-backed \u201cmaritime militia\u201d to bully China\u2019s neighbours. But when projecting power abroad, China\u2019s preference is typically for order, says Alessandro Arduino of King\u2019s College London, author of a forthcoming book, \u201cMoney for Mayhem: Mercenaries, Private Military Companies, Drones, and the Future of War\u201d. Perhaps 20 Chinese private security companies are active overseas. In addition to protecting Chinese companies and investments in Africa and elsewhere, they are often \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d for China\u2019s high-tech population controls, selling facial-recognition cameras, drones and other surveillance kit, he reports. Many Chinese guards are unarmed, hiring locals with guns as needed. In contrast, Russian private military companies like the Wagner Group actively profit from chaos and killing. \u201cInsecurity is their business model,\u201d says Mr Arduino of the Russians.

But China\u2019s goals are larger than this conflict. If the war drags on and if the endgame finds the West weary, divided and weakened, as China still hopes will happen, party leaders in Beijing will forgive a bit of Russian chaos on the way.
