"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last November Kosovo\u2019s Serbs resigned from the country\u2019s institutions, including the police. Elections in the Serb-populated north to replace the mayors who had quit were boycotted by Serbs, so ethnic Albanians were elected in their place, often by only a handful of voters. When the new mayors tried to move into their offices in May, local Serbs protested and a mob attacked NATO peacekeepers trying to keep demonstrators back. The Serbian government in Belgrade had hitherto kept a tight grip on Serb paramilitary-cum-criminal groups in northern Kosovo, but has recently seemed less active in doing so."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Escobar and Miroslav Lajcak, the EU\u2019s negotiator, had achieved a breakthrough in the spring by securing an agreement to implement a plan whereby Serbia would treat Kosovo as a state in all but name. In return, Kosovo\u2019s tiny Serb minority would be given a form of autonomy, which they had been promised in an earlier agreement, in 2013. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Serbia broke the new agreement by trying to block Kosovo\u2019s accession to the Council of Europe. America and the EU then asked Albin Kurti, Kosovo\u2019s prime minister, not to physically install the ethnic-Albanian northern mayors in their town halls. He did it anyway. Backed up by ethnic-Albanian policemen, he is changing the status quo of the past 20 years, alarming Kosovo\u2019s Serbs. A former political prisoner in Serbia, Mr Kurti has found that playing hardball pays dividends. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is changing the political landscape. Serbia\u2019s president, Alexandar Vucic, though declining to join sanctions against Russia, is letting Serbian companies send weapons to Ukraine.

So it is Mr Kurti who is getting the blame."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One diplomat says he doubts Mr Kurti is likely to keep his promise of autonomy for Kosovo\u2019s Serbs and suggests that the crisis in the north may help him disguise the fact that he has failed to fulfil many of his pledges elsewhere.

America and the EU have begun to impose sanctions on Kosovo, but not on Serbia. There is no end to this crisis in sight. And the threat of violence on a wider scale is real. \u25a0"}], "id": 36}
