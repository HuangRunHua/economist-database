Put them in a certain order and, lo, they become a phrase that looks like classical Chinese\u2014the kind of language used by the literati of yore. The idea they convey could be expressed just as succinctly in colloquial Chinese, but the classical style has gravitas. And it is a phrase loved by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, so all must follow suit. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "More than any of his predecessors, Mr Xi likes to spice up his speeches with quotations from classical literature, especially poetry and philosophy. It fits one of his stated missions: instilling \u201ccultural self-confidence\u201d (alongside confidence in the political system). And it helps to buff up his image. In Chinese history, rulers were expected to be erudite. Two volumes have been published providing explanations of Mr Xi\u2019s classical aphorisms. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Xi\u2019s four-character phrase is not among the more colourful of his classicisms. It is guozhidazhe, which he uses to mean \u201cthe main affairs of state\u201d or \u201cnational priorities\u201d. Unlike other phrases that he bandies around, it has no obvious origin in a well-known text. It is as if a Western leader, when presenting a big idea, were to concoct a Latin term to describe it. The grandiosity of Mr Xi\u2019s phrase makes it stand out, which is clearly what he wants. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since Mr Xi\u2019s first public use of guozhidazhe, during a trip in 2020 to the province of Shaanxi, it has taken the country by storm. Officials pepper their speeches with it. Articles about it keep appearing in state media (the phrase is usually adorned with attention-drawing quotation marks). Chinese academics write papers on the topic. Communist Party members discuss the term at meetings. It has spawned a book industry: \u201cWhat is Guozhidazhe?\u201d is the title of one work, published last year, that provides the answer in 156 pages."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Why should such a banal-sounding phrase get such a billing? It is because guozhidazhe, as used by Mr Xi, is a catch-all that really means \u201cmy lofty goals\u201d. The term is applied to everything from \u201cfood security\u201d (see next story) to \u201cpolitical security\u201d (keeping the party in charge) and fulfilling the \u201cChinese dream\u201d (making China a global power and unifying it with Taiwan). Mr Xi says officials must always \u201ccherish guozhidazhe\u201d. It is a way of reminding them who is boss. When they use the term, it is often in conjunction with other phrases expressing loyalty to Mr Xi. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Experts in China have tried to show that guozhidazhe has links with the classical canon, even if it is not a phrase associated with one of the literary giants. One such scholar is Chen Chengzha of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. He points to the \u201cTao Te Ching\u201d, a core text of Taoist philosophy that was written over two millennia ago (Mr Xi likes to quote from it). This mystical work says there are four great things in the universe (guozhidazhe could be translated as \u201cthe country\u2019s great things\u201d). One of them is the ruler. The flattery is obvious. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Engineering an image"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some cynics in China wonder whether Mr Xi is really as learned as he makes himself out to be. Much of his education was disrupted by the tumultuous Cultural Revolution. He attended one of the country\u2019s most prestigious universities, Tsinghua, at a time when little was taught there except Marxism and Maoism, and classical literature was scorned. Ostensibly, Mr Xi\u2019s degree was in chemical engineering. Later, while working as a provincial leader, he got a doctorate from Tsinghua. The English title of his thesis was \u201cA Tentative Study on China\u2019s Rural Marketisation\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "No such scepticism surfaces in the official media. In 1969, when a teenager, Mr Xi is said to have hauled \u201cheavy suitcases full of books\u201d when he was sent to the countryside to do farm work. The collections of his classical references purport to show his familiarity with a broad array of writers, from Confucius to Su Shi, an 11th-century poet. He has supposedly read numerous works by Shakespeare, or so the public is told. Xinhua, a government news agency, describes his reading list as \u201cgoing on and on\u201d. It is surprising, perhaps, that he has much time left for guozhidazhe. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 16}
