There are the blocky characters of Mandarin, the mother tongue of most Chinese. Then there is the vertically-written script of Mongolian, which is spoken by many people in the region. The language is not just seen on signs; it is heard in caf\u00e9s and used in classrooms (such as the one pictured). More Mongols live in Inner Mongolia than in Mongolia, the country next door."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the Mongolian language is dying in China, say activists, and not of natural causes. Three years ago the central government told schools in Inner Mongolia to replace the language with Mandarin when teaching some subjects. That sparked protests, but a year later China\u2019s legislature went further, annulling regulations that allowed autonomous regions to teach in minority languages. Today, kindergartens in Inner Mongolia are taught entirely in Mandarin and, according to locals, an increasing number of other classes are, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The decline of Mongolian is part of a years-long push by the central government to assimilate ethnic minorities across China. Officially, such groups are meant to have equal standing with the Han, the ethnic group that makes up over 90% of the mainland\u2019s population. In practice, the Han (who often speak Mandarin) dominate and other groups are marginalised. \u201cThey don\u2019t want minorities to be too distinctive,\u201d says a 25-year-old Mongol in the Inner Mongolian city of Tongliao. \u201cTo be blunt, they want to turn us into Han.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230916_CNM926.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 625.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "When the Communist Party took power in 1949, it inherited an unwieldy, multi-ethnic state with far-flung borders drawn during the Qing dynasty (1644-1912).

They gave larger ethnic groups living near China\u2019s borders\u2014Kazakhs, Koreans, Mongols, Tibetans and Uyghurs\u2014their own nominally autonomous areas and allowed them to be educated in their own languages. These groups were also given perks like extra points on the gaokao, China\u2019s notoriously gruelling university-entrance exam, and exemptions from the \u201cone-child\u201d policy.

Government persecution led to riots in Tibet in 2008. A year later Xinjiang, home of the Uyghurs, erupted. The unrest spooked senior officials in Beijing (most of whom are Han). Haunted by the disintegration of the Soviet Union, they worried that parts of China might become unstable or try to peel off. So the government sought to blur ethnic differences. Under Xi Jinping, who became leader in 2012, this effort has gained steam. Mr Xi often talks of ethnic unity and harmony.

Benefits, such as the bonus gaokao points, are being rolled back. Books that dwell on China\u2019s ethnic identities face bans. Such repression was highlighted in 2020, when a museum in France pulled an exhibition about Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol empire, that had been planned in collaboration with the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot. The French museum cited interference by the Chinese government, such as demands that the words \u201cGenghis Khan\u201d, \u201cMongol\u201d and \u201cempire\u201d not be used in exhibition material.

Kazakh, Korean, Tibetan and Uyghur have all been downgraded from mediums of instruction in schools to mere subjects, equivalent to foreign languages. In Tibet three-quarters of children are now taught in Mandarin-language boarding schools, which means they spend less time speaking Tibetan at home, too.

Officials are fond of pointing out that China\u2019s bank notes feature scripts of minority languages, as well as standard Chinese characters.

The authorities promote this identity using television shows, picture books and exhibitions.

Xinjiang is the prime example. Since 2017 perhaps a million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the region have been forced to spend time in \u201cre-education camps\u201d.

Mongols and Han have tussled over the use of grasslands, for example. But, generally speaking, the region is more stable than Xinjiang or Tibet.
