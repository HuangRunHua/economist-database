Standing in the bombed-out shell of a theatre in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, a Chinese opera singer, Wang Fang, belted out a Soviet-era ballad (pictured). In March last year many Ukrainian civilians were killed in a Russian attack on the building. So when a video of the 38-year-old\u2019s performance this month circulated online, it sparked a furore.

News of the latest manifestation of China-Russia friendship\u2014a meeting in Vladivostok between Russia\u2019s leader, Vladimir Putin, and a deputy prime minister from China, Zhang Guoqing\u2014was greeted with typical applause on China\u2019s heavily censored social media. Mr Putin told his guest that relations between the two countries had reached a level \u201cunprecedented\u201d in history. Mr Zhang said political co-operation was \u201cdeepening\u201d.

At least briefly, before censors began scrubbing references to her singing, Ms Wang\u2019s appearance in Russian-controlled Mariupol gave them an opportunity to speak out. On Weibo, a Twitter-like service, some users were quick to attack her choice of venue for singing such a song. \u201cKatyusha\u201d, as it is known, was used to inspire Soviet troops going to battle with the Germans during the second world war. It conveys a woman\u2019s love for her boyfriend on the front. Russia portrays its invasion of Ukraine as another anti-Nazi campaign. Chinese state media echo this line.

One is a retired professor living in Xinjiang, a far-western region. He told his 137,000 followers that Ms Wang would \u201cbe nailed to the pillar of shame in history\u201d. Another Weibo user, with nearly 1m followers, accused her of being \u201csimply out of her mind\u201d. Similar attacks were levelled at Ms Wang after she defended her visit to Mariupol at a press conference in Moscow alongside her husband, Zhou Xiaoping. Mr Zhou is an adviser to China\u2019s parliament and a prominent nationalist blogger. He was praised in 2014 by China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, for spreading \u201cpositive energy\u201d.

On Facebook a spokesman for its foreign ministry called Ms Wang\u2019s singing in the theatre \u201can example of complete moral degradation\u201d. He said her visit to Mariupol, along with others from China, was \u201cillegal\u201d and all members of the group would be banned from entering Ukraine. He also said he expected an explanation from China about the group\u2019s trip. In contrast, Denis Pushilin, the Russian-backed leader of Donetsk, the province to which Mariupol belongs, met the visitors and described Ms Wang\u2019s singing in the theatre as \u201ctouching\u201d. Russia has implausibly accused Ukrainian extremists of blowing up the building, where hundreds were taking shelter.

For all its cosiness with Mr Putin, China calls itself a neutral observer of the war and wants to earn kudos for helping to end hostilities (though its peace proposal does not demand Russia\u2019s withdrawal from Ukraine). China is even talking to the Vatican, with which it does not have diplomatic relations, about ways to resolve the conflict. The pope has sent a senior envoy on a rare official visit to Beijing to discuss the topic.

The war in Ukraine is \u201cnot China\u2019s war\u201d, said Mr Hu, who is a former editor-in-chief of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid in Beijing. For good measure, censors deleted Mr Hu\u2019s post too.
