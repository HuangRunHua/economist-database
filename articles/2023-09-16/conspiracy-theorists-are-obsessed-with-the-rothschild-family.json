Some conspiracy theorists claimed that the fires were caused by energy beamed from satellites, reviving an idea advanced in an online post from 2018 that attributed Californian wildfires to \u201cspace solar generators\u201d.

Her screed, later described as a rant about \u201cJewish space lasers\u201d (a phrase she had not in fact used), drew mockery.

This portrays the Rothschilds as puppet-masters who engineered the American civil war and hired Charles Darwin to invent the theory of evolution so they could promote a godless one-world government. They now supposedly control 80% of global wealth and run sperm banks to expand their bloodline. For reasons not wholly unrelated to his surname, the author is keen to discredit such preposterous notions. (A branch of the Rothschild family owns a stake in The Economist.

Dairnvaell\u2019s pamphlet about these \u201cvampires of commerce\u201d is now obscure, but its reach has been long. An inheritor of Dairnvaell\u2019s bile is Alex Jones, a right-wing radio host.

They begin with a paranoid aversion to official accounts of events and an eagerness to see causation where there is only correlation; they burgeon because they tap into what terrifies or enrages people, especially those who feel powerless. They travel quickly when they lend themselves to gossipy soundbites, sick humour and tasteless online memes. Like a never-ending laser show, they captivate people and distract them from reality. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 63}
