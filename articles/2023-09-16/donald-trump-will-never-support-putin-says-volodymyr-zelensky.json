Mr Putin \u201cdoes not understand that in the long war, he will lose. Because it does not matter that 60% or 70% [of Russians] support him. No, his economy will lose.\u201d As Ukraine increases its strikes inside Russia, Russians will start asking awkward questions about their army\u2019s inability to protect them, \u201cbecause our drones will land\u201d.
