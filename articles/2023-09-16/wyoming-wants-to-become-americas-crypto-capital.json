Why does America\u2019s least-populous state want to become a crypto capital? \u201cWyoming is heavily reliant on our mineral extractive industry,\u201d says Chris Rothfuss, one of two Democrats in the state Senate and the chair of a committee on fintech. Crypto, he argues, could help diversify its economy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Crypto has bipartisan support: its financial libertarianism appeals to small-government-loving Wyomingites. Digital assets, says Mr Rothfuss, let people \u201chave privacy\u201d and \u201cprevents the government from telling them what to do\u201d. Even the implosion of FTX and crash of crypto markets last year has not dented Wyoming\u2019s dreams. It wants to issue a stablecoin (a class of cryptocurrency) backed by US Treasury bills. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But it is not clear that Wyoming\u2019s enthusiasm for crypto will pay off. Three-quarters of Americans who have heard of cryptocurrencies do not think they are safe, according to Pew Research Centre, a think-tank. The Federal Reserve seems to agree. In 2019 Wyoming passed a law allowing the establishment of state-chartered banks that cater to firms using digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year the Fed denied one such bank\u2019s application to become a member of its system, arguing that the bank\u2019s risk-management framework was shoddy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Wyoming\u2019s quest to issue a stablecoin by the end of the year is also on shaky ground. Mark Gordon, its Republican governor, allowed a bill creating a stablecoin commission to pass into law without his signature. He expressed concern about the lack of proof that a market for such a token exists in Wyoming. \u201cThis is really all about signalling that you\u2019re in the crypto game\u2026and that you\u2019re innovative,\u201d says Chris Odinet, a law professor at the University of Iowa. Much like crypto itself, he says, the race to appear crypto-friendly is \u201clargely a lot of smoke and mirrors\u201d.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 16}
