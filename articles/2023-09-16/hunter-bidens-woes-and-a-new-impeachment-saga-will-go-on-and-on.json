In the case of Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden\u2019s wayward son, and his business dealings when his father was vice-president, many of the ingredients are there: large sums of money, questionable foreign companies, a powerful father with influence over those companies\u2019 fate. After years of investigation, however, what is still missing, so far, is any proof that these really did mature into a scandal in the Petri dish. That did not deter Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House, from announcing the start of impeachment inquiries into President Biden on September 12th. That \u201cculture\u201d of corruption, he said, warrants further investigation. The chance of a conviction of the president is almost nil. But the hearings will tie up Congress for months."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr McCarthy\u2019s announcement came in response to pressure from right-wing members of his wafer-thin majority, who have long been pressing for impeachment. But it also builds on months of Republican noise about Hunter Biden. On August 28th the Southeastern Legal Foundation (SLF), a Republican-aligned legal charity based in Georgia, announced it is suing the National Archives to try to force it to release 5,138 emails the archivists have identified as having come from three email addresses Joe Biden used with pseudonyms, such as \u201cRobin Ware\u201d and \u201cRobert L. Peters\u201d. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, who has been probing Hunter Biden\u2019s activities since January, had already requested in mid-August that the emails be released to him."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Comer\u2019s case, in essence, is that the emails will prove that Mr Biden did in fact know in detail what his son was up to in his role between 2014 and 2019 on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian oil-and-gas firm. According to Mr Comer, one email already found on Hunter\u2019s laptop shows that: \u201cJoe Biden was using a pseudonym and he copied his son about a shady, shady transaction.\u201d The rest, he implied, would show the president tied into a scheme of \u201cinfluence peddling\u201d. In particular, it would show that, as vice-president, Mr Biden tried to help his son by pushing for the ouster of Viktor Shokin, a former chief prosecutor of Ukraine, who was investigating corruption at Burisma. This, he says, is backed up by the testimony of Devon Archer, one of Hunter\u2019s business associates."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In reality, the evidence revealed by Mr Comer does not show that. The email he refers to, forwarded to Hunter from the \u201cRobert L. Peters\u201d account in May 2016, does indeed include details about the vice-president making a call with Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine\u2019s president at the time. But it also gave details of Mr Biden\u2019s schedule\u2014and said he would be staying at a family home in Delaware that evening, where he would be hosting a memorial service for his other son, Beau. Hunter\u2019s lawyers say that is why he was included. The email was sent two months after Mr Shokin was pushed out by Ukraine\u2019s parliament. And, in his deposition, Mr Archer argued the opposite of what Mr Comer alleges. \u201cShokin being fired\u2026was not good\u201d for Burisma, he said. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is the latest in an investigation which so far has overpromised and underdelivered. Mr Comer has alleged that Joe Biden took bribes while serving as vice-president. In July, pressed by a Fox News anchor on whether he could prove that, he said, \u201cI sure hope so.\u201d Much of what he has turned up shows the younger Biden suggesting to his clients that he could influence his father. But nothing shows that it was much more than a bluff. Take an email Hunter sent to Mr Archer about a visit his father was paying to Ukraine. Mr Comer alleges this trip was taken to help Hunter. In the email, Hunter says about his father: \u201cWhat he will say and do is out of our hands.\u201d Mr Archer argued this was evidence of how Hunter tried to take credit for things his father did independently."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet although Mr Comer\u2019s investigation is failing to prove the existence of what Donald Trump calls the \u201cBiden crime family\u201d, congressional inquiries will now multiply. Democrats say that Mr Biden has done nothing wrong. Ian Sams, a White House spokesman, argues that \u201cgovernment leaders for decades have used aliases to avoid spam and hacking.\u201d Barack Obama, as well as several senior officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations, are known to have done so. But that does not explain why two of the email accounts Mr Biden apparently used were private Gmail accounts, rather than official government ones. It also does not explain the pair exchanging emails about the potential appointment of John McGrail, a friend of Hunter\u2019s who is now a Treasury official, to Mr Biden\u2019s staff. A job recommendation is not corrupt\u2014but it does suggest that father and son did discuss work."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile, the younger Mr Biden\u2019s legal problems are intensifying. On September 6th prosecutors serving under David Weiss, the special counsel investigating him, announced that they expect an indictment by the end of the month. Hunter is likely to be charged with not paying taxes and lying on a form when buying a gun at a time when he was addicted to crack cocaine. A plea deal that would have kept him out of jail on those charges fell apart. Other, more damaging charges\u2014such as lobbying for a foreign government without registering\u2014have not been ruled out. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "None of that implicates the president. Yet he may suffer for it nonetheless. According to a CNN poll, three-fifths of Americans think Mr Biden was involved in his son\u2019s business.
