Those found guilty may be hit with tariffs far above the 10% now levied on Chinese imports. These imports are small but growing fast. In the first seven months of 2023, 189,000 Chinese cars were sold in Europe, equivalent to 2.8% of all car sales. But Chinese pure battery cars made up nearly 8% of sales for this type of vehicle, reckons Schmidt Automotive Research, a consultancy (see chart). These sales have trebled in the past two years, led by Polestar and mg. Brands like Aiways, byd, Nio, Ora and Xpeng are also on sale. Others, like Leapmotor, are poised to join them. ubs, a bank, reckons China\u2019s share of all cars sold in Europe could hit 20% by 2030. All will be electrified."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s advance is in part a result of its government\u2019s desire to create a global force in carmaking. A slowdown in ev sales at home as the economy weakens and lots of spare capacity have encouraged Chinese producers to look abroad. With America\u2019s market protected by heftier tariffs and subsidies favouring domestic carmakers, they are eyeing Europe instead. The more compact Chinese models are anyway more suited to European tastes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Undoubtedly the Chinese carmakers have benefited from government largesse such as cheap loans. But making anti-dumping charges stick will be tricky. Complaints from a European industry that has long been hooked on all manner of state support look hypocritical. More important, as ubs notes, the 25% cost advantage over European rivals for the byd Seal, a mid-market ev that will go for as little as \u20ac45,000 ($48,000), are mostly the result of the firm\u2019s high degree of vertical integration and the low-cost Chinese supply chain, not government handouts. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Europe\u2019s carmakers are split on the wisdom of the commission\u2019s move. At the top end of the market, where brand loyalty is strong, Chinese firms like Nio are unlikely to challenge Mercedes and bmw, with or without subsidies. But by enraging the government in Beijing, the investigation endangers European companies\u2019 Chinese profits. Half of German car firms\u2019 net profits come from China, according to Bernstein, a broker. By contrast, marques such as Renault, which do not rely on China but face a daunting challenge in the cut-throat mass market, will probably cheer. Swingeing tariffs may spare them from having to cut costs to compete with a Chinese influx. European car buyers, who probably don\u2019t care if China\u2019s government had a hand in keeping down the price of evs, will be the ones to suffer. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 51}
