Decades later, a sick woman and her infant captured by Native Americans are brought to the home. The events that immediately follow\u2014which involve poison, axes and guns\u2014evoke a country in conflict. They are the first instances of violence that occur at the home, but not the last.

Chapters are written as letters, songs, a true-crime story, a lecture to a historical society (echoing the epilogue of Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d) and even a real-estate advertisement.
