The delicately euphemistic \u201cNuclear miscalculation\u201d beats that with a stronger \u201cimpact\u201d score of 4. By contrast, the \u201cAccidental\u2026release of a hazardous pathogen\u201d and \u201cAssassination of a high-profile public figure\u201d feel barely worth bothering with: each scores a paltry 2. Highest-scoring of all is \u201cPandemic\u201d, with a splendidly robust 5. Admittedly \u201cCivil Nuclear Accident\u201d scores 5 too. But \u201cPandemic\u201d also threatens \u201cup to 840,000 deaths\u201d. So it wins. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To read the British government\u2019s risk register is like sifting through a game of apocalyptic Top Trumps. It lists the many, varied, and sometimes splattery ways in which Britons might be wiped out\u2014then assigns scores to them. As with Top Trumps, some entries are more eye-catching than others: few will suffer sleepless nights over a \u201cmajor outbreak of African Horse Sickness\u201d (unless you keep mules, in which case: be worried). Others are less ignorable. Few, for example, could read the entry for \u201cPandemic\u201d, with its talk of tests, waves and hospitalisations, without a dull sense of dread. The apocalypse\u2014once entertainingly abstract\u2014feels considerably less remote than it once did."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Britain\u2019s risk registers were first published in 2008, when they felt less like an essential tool than an eccentric bureaucratic hobby. Since then, Russia has invaded Ukraine; AI has threatened to develop godlike intelligence with Old Testament consequences; and the pandemic has killed 25m people worldwide. Toby Ord, a philosopher at Oxford, puts the odds of humanity suffering some sort of existential catastrophe within the next century at about one in six. The end, if not yet nigh, feels rather nigher than before."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Which means planning for it matters. Britain\u2019s risk register is widely considered to be good\u2014not perfect; but not bad. It is more detailed, more precise and less secretive than before. It has flaws: its methodology is still too opaque; its production a little too cloak-and-dagger. Worse, slow-moving cataclysms (antimicrobial resistance, AI) aren\u2019t on it. And it isn\u2019t clear who is responsible for dealing with each risk. But one of the biggest criticisms is of its presentation. This sounds trivial; it is not. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Each risk receives two scores for \u201clikelihood\u201d and \u201cimpact\u201d\u2014the latter runs from 1 (\u201cminor\u201d ) to 5 (the less reassuring \u201ccatastrophic\u201d). These are then plotted on a matrix. But that \u201ccatastrophic\u201d category is capacious. The scale is logarithmic, so within a single square are threats that might cause 1,000 deaths and ones that might cause 100,000. This looks foursquare and tidy on the page but is a problem, thinks Martin Rees, the co-founder of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk in Cambridge and author of \u201cIf Science is to Save Us\u201d. To reflect megadisasters fairly the doom-o-meter ought \u201cto have some extra grades\u201d to make people \u201cthink sufficiently urgently\u201d about them. Perhaps even a fold-out flap. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are other quirks. The advice the register offers to individuals feels faintly feeble; at times almost eccentric. For a \u201cmarauding terrorist attack\u201d, it refers to advice that tells people to \u201crun\u201d then \u201chide\u201d, which, though sensible, is not wholly comforting. It also suggests that to prepare for disaster people might like to stash wind-up radios and bottled water at home, or join \u201ca community group or social club that is active in emergency preparedness\u201d. What those who don\u2019t have a local nuclear fallout club should do for fun is not clear. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To understand what governments can do when they really want to, go to Brentwood, in Essex. Go past the golf courses and the garden centres and, at the foot of a hill, is a boring-looking bungalow. Step inside and it is surprisingly cool: its walls are thick; its windows blocked off by steel shutters. Go down the steps and cold air creeps around your ankles. You are standing at the start of a 100-odd-metre tunnel leading to the British government\u2019s nuclear bunker. You are standing at the foot of what taking risk really seriously looks like. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is the Kelvedon Hatch underground bunker, built in 1952 to house politicians and civil servants in the event of a nuclear attack. Today, its eerie, mazy corridors smell of floor polish and the past. There is a decontamination unit by the door; Geiger counters hang on hooks. In a large communications room, signs on the walls show what the desks below represented: this table was to be the \u201cHOME OFFICE\u201d; that one the \u201cJUDICIARY\u201d; a third the \u201cARMY\u201d. Upstairs, the sign on a dingy dorm-room door reads \u201cPRIME MINISTER\u201d. An entire country, reduced to corridors."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kelvedon is an example of doing risk very well indeed. It is also an example of why governments don\u2019t bother with most risks. The bunker is extraordinary\u2014it was also useless. Never needed, it was decommissioned in 1994; now it is a museum. There is a cost to not taking risks seriously; there also is a cost to taking them very seriously. A lose-lose situation that feels dispiriting. Though on the bright side, if a truly terrible unforeseen risk arrives, at least no one will be around to criticise. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
