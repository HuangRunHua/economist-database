Inflation in the rich world has fallen from its peak but stayed stubbornly high. At around 4%, it is well above the level at which most central banks are comfortable. Governments, weighed down by vast debts, must use precious revenues to pay interest on the debt, which itself is growing because of high interest rates. The energy transition and rising state spending owing to ageing populations add to the fiscal largesse. Raising taxes is politically fraught, so more money is printed. Inflation stays high and governments\u2019 credibility worsens. Central bankers are scratching their heads, wondering how their powerful weapon\u2014the interest rate\u2014has failed so thoroughly."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A wonkish theory, laid out in glorious detail in a new book by John Cochrane of Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, would offer a potential explanation. \u201cThe Fiscal Theory of the Price Level\u201d builds a theory of inflation as ambitious as that proposed by John Maynard Keynes\u2019s \u201cThe General Theory\u201d or Milton Friedman\u2019s and Anna Schwartz\u2019s \u201cA Monetary History\u201d. Mr Cochrane, whose own work on the subject spans four decades, spends nearly 600 pages reworking the maths of past economic models to incorporate fiscal theory, while chattily discussing how it explains past inflationary episodes. \u201c[E]ven Milton Friedman might change his mind with new facts and experience at hand,\u201d he speculates."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the heart of Mr Cochrane\u2019s theory is the idea that government debt can be valued like a firm\u2019s equity, based on the returns to its owner\u2019s pockets. The price level will adjust\u2014and therefore drive inflation or deflation\u2014to ensure that the real value of the debt equals the sum of a government\u2019s future budget surpluses, appropriately discounted. Thus the true driver of inflation is government debt not monetary policy. Under this theory, money is valuable because it can be used to pay tax and generate surpluses. The set-up is not all that different from the gold standard, except it is tax, rather than gold, that backs money. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Cochrane is careful to note that the adjustment of the price level is not instantaneous. People can be poor judges of a government\u2019s credibility when it comes to paying off debts. Just like stocks, prices are able to deviate from fundamentals. Yet in the long run, they adjust. A government that hands out money without eventually running surpluses will not avoid inflation for ever. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "History appears to offer support. Brad DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley, uses fiscal theory in his recent book, \u201cSlouching towards Utopia\u201d, to explain inflation in post-first-world-war Europe. In France hefty debt-interest payments led to an average of 20% annual inflation over seven years. In Germany things were worse. The public lost faith in the ability of the state to pay off its debts without inflation. Soon hyperinflation kicked in. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Cochrane also brings fiscal theory to bear on America\u2019s inflation in the 1970s-80s. In the mid-1970s price rises exceeded 12%. The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates; inflation dropped to 5% by 1977. Yet Mr Cochrane points out that inflation shot up again to more than 14% by 1980, in part because America failed to get its fiscal house in order. Fiscal and regulatory reforms that raised expectations of future surpluses, along with another dose of monetary medicine, were needed to vanquish inflation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "How is fiscal theory faring today? For a decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09, prices stayed stubbornly low despite a ballooning supply of money and interest rates sitting at or below zero in much of the rich world. A \u201ccrude monetarism\u201d predicted an inflationary surge, which did not materialise. Other revamped \u201cNew Keynesian\u201d models also proved unhelpful. When governments spent big during the covid-19 pandemic, many economists, reasoning from recent history, were sanguine about the possibility of inflation."}, {"role": "body", "imageURL": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dgmDcK5wssU", "imageWidth": 640.0, "imageHeight": 360.0, "imageDescription": "", "text": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Cochrane argues fiscal theory can explain both the period of low inflation and the return of rapidly rising prices after the pandemic. Inflation was meagre in the 2010s, despite soaring government debts, because politicians promised to get their books in order and low interest rates meant consumers and bondholders were willing to wait. Yet during the pandemic, governments took a different approach. They dropped enormous cheques into consumers\u2019 pockets. The Fed purchased government debt immediately after its issuance. There was little talk of sustainability. Mr Cochrane argues that the direct nature of these \u201chelicopter drops\u201d informed people their newly fat pockets would not be drained by future taxes. Thus they were more willing to spend."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Heads I win, tails you lose"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This story is perhaps too convenient. Indeed, Mr Cochrane admits that fiscal theory\u2019s flaw is it offers a way of explaining nearly any series of historical events in an unfalsifiable manner. Yes, other theories of inflation have problems. But if it is so hard to prove fiscal theory wrong, are they really in a fair fight? Mr Cochrane\u2019s story of how inflation ended in the 1980s is complicated by the fact that America actually cut taxes, suggesting politicians were not all that concerned by balanced budgets. Although deregulation may have boosted growth, many economists think the budget surpluses of the 1990s were mainly caused by globalisation and an it boom, which few consumers in the 1980s saw coming."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fiscal theory also offers limited guidance to policymakers beyond what is already well-known. Under its approach, monetary policy remains important: interest rates can spread out an increase in the price level over a period of time. In addition, the theory suggests governments must maintain credibility when it comes to paying off their debts\u2014hardly a radical idea.
