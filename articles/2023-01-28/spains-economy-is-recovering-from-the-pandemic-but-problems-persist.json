Annual inflation, running at 5.6% in December, is the lowest in the euro zone, in part because Spain consumes little Russian gas. The main share-price index has made up most of its losses. The unemployment rate is the lowest since 2008, when the financial crisis burst a construction bubble. Tourism rebounded strongly last year.

In 2023, the IMF forecasts growth of just 1.1%. But even that would still be ahead of the growth currently expected for the euro area as a whole. The news is well timed for the government led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s centre-left Socialists. Spain holds local elections in May, and a general election at the end of the year.

GDP and consumption have been slow to return to pre-pandemic levels. With wage growth subdued, inflation has bitten into real incomes.

Last year\u2019s growth may be expected for a country that typically overshoots its neighbours\u2019 ups and downs. The modest growth expected in 2023, say analysts, is largely the result of the European Union\u2019s pandemic-recovery programme, of which Spain is the second-biggest beneficiary: it is getting some \u20ac77bn in grants, plus loans. Spain was quick to design its programme for the funds, but has been slow to spend them\u2014thanks partly to its heavily decentralised government, says Nadia Calvi\u00f1o, the economy minister. The money should finally flow in earnest this year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Once it does, Ms Calvi\u00f1o says it should support a virtuous circle. Productivity has grown feebly for two decades. The money is meant help change that, with public-private projects making high-value-added products like electric cars, and digitising small businesses and health care."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The most common criticism is that Spain\u2019s fiscal homework remains undone. Its tax-collection numbers are up, thanks to black-market jobs entering the licit sector during the pandemic, when being officially employed brought with it the ability to take advantage of aid programmes. But the structural deficit is still worryingly high\u2014perhaps 4.5-5.0% of GDP, says Ign\u00e1cio de la Torre of Arcano, an investment firm. The EU\u2019s deficit limit of 3% of GDP, suspended in the pandemic, returns next year. Pensions remain in deficit, with the general budget used to cover annual shortfalls of at least 1.5% of GDP, says \u00c1ngel de la Fuente of FEDEA, a think-tank. But few expect the reforms currently being discussed to be enough to make the system sustainable when Spain\u2019s younger-than-average baby-boom generation retires.
