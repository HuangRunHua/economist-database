Total labour supply (people who have or are seeking jobs) is roughly back to pre-pandemic levels. By contrast, labour demand (filled plus open jobs) has increased by 3m positions. The excess demand represents about 3% of all those employed, which has contributed to big nominal wage gains.

Immigration, a key source of labour, also fell. Now, however, the labour-force participation (lfp) rate of prime-age workers (aged 25-54) and the foreign-born workforce have almost fully recovered.

Since 2019 those aged at least 65 have gone from less than 16% of the population to nearly 17%. Moreover, unlike prime-age workers, many people who retired early as covid-19 struck have not come back to work. lfp among older Americans, which rose from 12.5% in 2000 to 20.7% in early 2020, has dipped to 19.3%, the same as in 2016. The ageing of the population accounts for the loss of 1.9m workers (0.7% of people aged at least 16), while the overall drop in lfp, mainly among the old, is responsible for a further 0.5m (0.2%)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some think that a trend among younger people to scale back their working intensity, known as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, may have caused the labour market to tighten. Recent research by scholars at Washington University in St Louis reveals a clear reduction in hours worked by those in jobs. But most quiet quitters are high-earning workers, whereas the biggest labour shortages have been in basic service jobs. That points to another factor: illness.
