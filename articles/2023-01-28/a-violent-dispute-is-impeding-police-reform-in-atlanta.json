On January 21st hundreds of protesters holding \u201cdefund the police\u201d signs flooded Atlanta\u2019s Peachtree Street. Windows were smashed and a police car was torched. Like so many times before the outcry was over a police killing. A 26-year-old was gunned down by a cop last week. But this time the story was different. The victim was shot protesting against a city initiative enacted in response to the Black Lives Matter marches. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Amid demands for police reform, Atlanta\u2019s city council approved $30m for a new police training facility in September 2021. The centre would teach cops to be, \u201crooted in respect and regard for the communities they serve\u201d. It would include a shooting range and a mock city. But environmentalists objected, since the complex was to be built on 85 acres of woodlands, in an area known as the South River Forest. The mostly undeveloped site\u2014dubbed \u201ccop city\u201d by opponents\u2014became fertile ground for civil unrest. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The \u201cforest defenders\u201d, a band of climate activists, have spent the past year living in the South River trees. Police have tried to extract them using rubber bullets and tear gas. Then on January 18th the Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported that Manuel Ter\u00e1n, a non-binary medic known as \u201cTortuguita\u201d (Spanish for \u201clittle turtle\u201d), opened fire on a state trooper as police cleared the encampments. Cops shot back, killing the activist. But there is no footage of the incident\u2014troopers were not wearing body cameras. Activists are calling it \u201ccold-blooded murder\u201d. Reporters who spent time with Tortuguita earlier in the year noted a commitment to peaceful protest. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to beat them at violence,\u201d Tortuguita told the Bitter Southerner, a local paper. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very good at violence\u201d. But for a supposedly irenic group the forest defenders had lots of weapons: cops confiscated fireworks, blades, air rifles and a handgun that belonged to Tortuguita in the raid. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Soon environmental battles in the woods morphed into anti-police protests downtown. Activists on the streets objected to investing in the police force, especially after the killing. The storefronts that were smashed belonged to companies like Wells Fargo that had pledged funds to cop city. \u201cThey have blood on their hands,\u201d says Nolan Huber-Rhoades, an organiser affiliated with the forest defenders, \u201cmany of the activists think breaking their windows is more than appropriate\u201d. Six protesters were arrested for arson, criminal damage and domestic terrorism. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some key players are out-of-towners: Tortuguita was from Tallahassee and only one of the protesters arrested is from Georgia. They do not necessarily represent local feeling. \u201cThe average black person in Atlanta said \u2018fuck the police, but don\u2019t defund it\u2019,\u201d says King Williams, a local black filmmaker who is involved in the debates. The training facility was first proposed by a black councilwoman, who saw the need to fix chronic under-policing in poor neighbourhoods. When officers began calling in sick en-masse in June 2020\u2014a phenomenon known as the \u201cblue flu\u201d\u2014the force became depleted. Many Atlantans wanted more (and better) policing, not less. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The training facility would help with that. But its location brought problems, even for the council. Lawmakers vowed to plant 100 hardwood trees for each one cut down. The bill passed in a 10-4 vote after 17 hours of public comments\u2014most of which were against the plan. The councilwoman who proposed the facility lost her election to a younger candidate who opposed it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Despite the resistance since, plans have not changed. Many politicians still support the facility. \u201cAnyone who wants a safe street should want a well-trained police officer,\u201d says Amir Farokhi, a city council member for the progressive 2nd district. Mr Williams suspects media attention will expedite construction\u2014he reckons bulldozers will soon take to the forest."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the way out of the South River Forest on a recent afternoon your correspondent came across a group of ten people dressed in camouflage suits and balaclavas. They nodded hello to Mr Huber-Rhoades, the organiser, as they headed deeper into the woods. \u201cNew people moving in, I guess,\u201d he said with a smile.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}]}
