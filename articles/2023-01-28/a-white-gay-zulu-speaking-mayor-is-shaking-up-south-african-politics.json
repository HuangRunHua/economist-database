It educates the children of the rural poor\u2014or at least tries to. For a year it has had no clean water. Nor does it have state-provided transport for its pupils. This abruptly ended after officials were threatened by the owners of private minibuses who wanted the business. A few kids now walk; some cover 20km (12 miles) in a day. But more stay at home. Taking the minibus costs 450 rand ($28) a month, more than the 350-rand welfare grant given to the destitute.

But that has not stopped the mayor of the local municipality, Umngeni, from visiting. Chris Pappas (pictured) listens to teachers and mothers and says he will try to help. He does this in Zulu, the ladies\u2019 mother tongue, which he learnt while growing up on a farm. \u201cHaving somebody who can speak their language is very, very important,\u201d says Nene Philpine, the head teacher. \u201cIt gives a better and complete understanding.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Pappas is an unusual politician. He is white in a municipality where three-quarters of residents are black. He is fluent in Zulu (it is rare to find whites who speak South African languages other than English and the Dutch-based Afrikaans). He is 31 years old, roughly half the average age of the country\u2019s cabinet. He is gay. And he is from the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition, whose stronghold is in and around Cape Town. A year ago Mr Pappas became the first DA mayor to win an outright majority in a KZN municipality. His story is revealing\u2014and encouraging\u2014about the state of South African politics.

The ANC usually wins a majority of the black electorate, while the DA takes most of the votes cast by the two largest minorities: whites and \u201ccoloureds\u201d, or mixed-race South Africans. Yet when South Africans irrespective of ethnicity are asked what matters most to them, polls suggest that they care more about jobs, corruption, crime and electricity blackouts than about race relations. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Pappas\u2019s election in late 2021 shows it is possible for talented candidates to win support across the old divisions. Black voters in Umngeni, like those across the country, \u201cfeel betrayed by the ANC\u201d, he says. The mayor deliberately ran a \u201clocalised campaign\u201d that promised tangible improvements but not \u201cmiracles\u201d. Though his narrow victory depended on DA voters turning out in relatively high numbers while many ex-ANC supporters stayed home, he also needed to lift his party\u2019s share of the black vote from 8.7% to 11.7%. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The success of Mr Pappas and his (black) deputy, Sandile Mnikathi, suggests that the monstrous damage caused by the ANC is reversible. Until the DA took over, the municipality had never run a budget surplus. Like most ANC-run local governments, its financial reporting was deemed inadequate by the auditor-general, a watchdog. Over the past year Mr Pappas has got Umngeni into the black by freezing hiring and stopping vanity projects. \u201cThere will be far fewer projects where politicians can go around and cut ribbons,\u201d Mr Pappas tells provincial officials. This is freeing up funds for new schemes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One involves contracting out simple jobs, such as cutting the grass, to individuals. That sounds basic but it undermines the way ANC councils typically operate, awarding large tenders to politically connected cronies, often from outside the municipality, to get kickbacks. The municipality is also doing more to help the poor, for instance by making more households eligible for some free electricity. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The mayor\u2019s brand of politics is not flashy. But he argues that the simple act of doing what you said you would do is vital in a young democracy. \u201cSouth Africans have lost faith in the democratic system as a means for change,\u201d he says. A poll in 2021 found that two-thirds of South Africans \u201cwould be willing to give up elections\u201d if an unelected government could provide security, housing and jobs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Pappas\u2019s optimism is welcome. South Africans have been ground down by almost 29 years of ANC misrule. Black voters have become increasingly apathetic. Some have given up voting, while many whites retreat into their affluent bubbles. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with South Africa,\u201d says Mr Pappas. \u201cFour hundred people moaning on WhatsApp and no one doing anything.\u201d If modern South Africa\u2019s next big transition, from ANC hegemony to coalition governments, is to work, it will need more of this can-do spirit. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "South Africa could also do with more whites who can speak African languages. When he was in prison, Nelson Mandela encouraged blacks to learn Afrikaans to understand \u201cthe language of the oppressor\u201d. Later, he saw it as an emollient gesture: when he spoke to Afrikaners in their language it went \u201cstraight to their hearts\u201d, he said. The power of language in politics is patent when you hear Mr Pappas conversing in Zulu. \u201cThe ability to listen [in Zulu] is more important than the ability to speak,\u201d he adds. In this age of populism, it is a valuable lesson. \u25a0"}], "id": 30}
