In France the slimline silhouette seduces consumers off the catwalk too, year round, on billboards and in advertising spots. This body ideal persists, despite the fact that even in France obesity is on the rise. Between 1997 and 2020 the share of obese French adults doubled, to 17%, or 8m people."}, {"role": "body", "text": "France\u2019s obesity rate is still well below that in America (40%), Mexico (33%) or Britain (26%). But the trend worries French public-health officials, for reasons ranging from mental-health issues to weight-related conditions such as diabetes. The government has set up a task force on obesity, under Martine Laville, a professor of nutrition in Lyon. It will report back in March. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Obesity in France is most marked among those on low incomes, in the ex-industrial north-east and, perhaps surprisingly, among women (French men still have on average one of the lowest rates in the European Union). A poor diet high in processed food is one explanation for the income gap. According to a report by the French Senate, the obesity rate among manual workers in France reached 18% in 2020, whereas for managerial workers it is below 10%.

In 2017 France did ban the use of excessively thin catwalk models. \u201cGrossophobie (fat phobia) hurts,\u201d said Marianne James, a talent-show judge weighing 138kg (304 pounds), who graced a magazine cover this week. But such images remain rare. One of the \u201csingular achievements of French civilisation\u201d, wrote Mireille Guiliano, in a best-selling book in 2004, is that \u201cFrench women don\u2019t get fat\u201d. Such claims now seem as unhelpful as they are untrue."}], "id": 40}
