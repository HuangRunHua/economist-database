It was 1947 and Mr Hopper, his reputation as one of America\u2019s great realist painters by then secure, was facing eviction with his wife, Josephine, from their apartment on Washington Square, in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Moses, New York\u2019s master builder, had been trying for years to ram a wide road through the square, yet Hopper hoped to enlist him in a campaign to block New York University from pursuing its own development goals by buying his building and others."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No public official could get involved \u201ceven if he agreed with your point of view,\u201d Moses replied, adding, in case he had been too oblique: \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t agree with it at all.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This exchange of letters, alongside others Hopper wrote resisting development of Washington Square, comes as a shock to the visitor wandering through \u201cEdward Hopper\u2019s New York\u201d at the Whitney Museum of American Art, in Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District. To encounter the author\u2019s plain-spoken voice in strenuous argument is to appreciate anew its subtlety, if not its absence, in the paintings themselves. Hopper\u2019s artistic perspective is always clear, if uncanny, but his intellectual point of view is enigmatic. What does he believe, what messages is he trying to send?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is so much missing from the scores of sketches, etchings and paintings in this exhibition, which covers the six decades, from 1908 to 1967, that Hopper made the city his home. Where are the convulsions of history\u2014the two world wars, the Great Depression, the labour strikes, the civil rights movement, the ticker-tape parades? Where, for that matter, is the Empire State Building or the Brooklyn Bridge, or any of the city\u2019s celebrated landmarks? Where are all the people? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hopper gives us instead, in \u201cThe City\u201d (1927), a view of his beloved Washington Square that includes his block of town houses but also imagined buildings of various styles. Is he bemoaning any change, or is he celebrating the ad hoc, vibrant version of it so characteristic of New York? In \u201cEarly Sunday Morning\u201d (1930), he presents a deserted streetscape of two-story buildings, low yellow light drawing long shadows from a fireplug and a candy-striped barber pole. Does that grey rectangle looming in the upper-right corner signal disapproval of the skyscrapers rising in Manhattan? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Again and again, he shows us solitude: A woman sits alone in \u201cThe Automat\u201d (1927), framed by lights reflected in the window behind her as she stares at the coffee cup she holds; an usher in \u201cNew York Movie\u201d (1939) ignores the film as, haloed by a sconce, she cradles her chin in one hand and silently contemplates a story of her own; a man in shirtsleeves sits at his sunlit desk in \u201cOffice in a Small City\u201d (1953), gazing at a water tower and chimneys across the way. What are they thinking? Are they lonely and alienated, as many viewers infer? Or is their experience more grand and romantic? Are they imagining, reflecting, envisioning a future? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hopper was a taciturn man. He was known to sit silently in Washington Square Park as he thought through a painting. \u201cSometimes talking with Eddie is just like dropping a stone in a well,\u201d Josephine said, \u201cexcept it doesn\u2019t thump when it hits bottom.\u201d Hopper resisted explaining his work, insisting \u201cthe whole answer is there on the canvas\u201d. He would ride the elevated subways\u2014today mostly submerged\u2014prizing his glimpses down at sidewalk life and through backlit windows into the city\u2019s infinite intimate tales."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe inner life of a human being is a vast and varied realm\u201d, Hopper wrote in \u201cReality: A Journal of Artists\u2019 Opinions,\u201d which he helped found in 1953 to protest against the growing dominance of Abstract Expressionism. In a joint statement, Hopper and his confederates objected to the art world\u2019s mania for \u201cthe excitation of texture and colour\u201d and the \u201critual jargon\u201d that went with it, which were creating \u201can atmosphere of irresponsibility, snobbery and ignorance.\u201d Texture and colour, along with other elements of painting, were rightly understood as \u201conly the means to a larger end, which is the depiction of man and his world\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hopper\u2019s own ambition, he wrote in his private journal, was to create \u201ca realistic art from which fantasy can grow\u201d. That he achieved his goal may account for the crowds packing the exhibition and turning its sold-out catalogue into \u201cone of the hottest gifts in town\u201d, in the words of the New York Post.

What the visitor to the Whitney senses instead is something quieter, something timeless and universal by way of being as ephemeral and particular as a shaft of sunlight on a woman\u2019s face: Hopper\u2019s respect for the uniqueness of his subjects and of his audience, for the vast and varied realm within each. Jostled by the crowd as they stand before Hopper\u2019s works, viewers are free to puzzle out for themselves whether they are grasping his meaning about place and person, or arriving at their own. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Would Hopper be happy to know that, though NYU did take over his building, it preserved his top-floor studio? He would no doubt be relieved that Jane Jacobs, the urban theorist and activist, stymied Moses in bulldozing an expressway through Greenwich Village. (He might be less pleased that zoning has made the Village an ossified idea of urban life struggling artists cannot afford.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One wonders what he would make of the glass-and-steel tower that is the Whitney itself, amid the extravagant jumble of the Meatpacking District. The area has changed so much this century. Yet that is thanks to the High Line, the park developed from an old elevated train track, terminating at the Whitney. It helps millions of people each year see life as Hopper did, at an odd angle and on a human scale, identifying their own New York as they enact their unique dramas within the ever-changing city. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics:George Santos is the congressman America deserves (Jan 17th)How rappers are strengthening Donald Trump\u2019s movement (Jan 12th)The great mystery of American politics (Jan 5th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}]}
