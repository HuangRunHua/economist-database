Something similar happened to the Sarajevo-born author himself. In 1992 the implosion of Yugoslavia shattered his Bosnian homeland and left him stranded in Chicago. He weathered odd jobs and hard knocks to emerge\u2014with the publication in 2000 of his short-story collection, \u201cThe Question of Bruno\u201d\u2014as an English-language writer of verbal agility and ethical finesse."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Migration, dispossession and their legacies run through his work. \u201cI live for tales of displacement and oblivion,\u201d this book\u2019s afterword acknowledges. \u201cThe World and All That It Holds\u201d is both ampler and simpler than some of his past experiments. Its story of love, hope and survival traverses the Eurasian land mass and the 20th century, from the trenches of the first world war to the chaos of occupied Shanghai."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The story begins in June 1914. An assassin\u2019s bullets slay the Habsburg heirs in Sarajevo, and an epoch ends. Soon, in the blood-drenched dugouts of Galicia, the Jewish pharmacist Rafael Pinto meets\u2014and falls in love with\u2014a Muslim fellow Sarajevan, Osman Karisik. Their secret passion will span decades of mayhem, in which they arduously learn that \u201cCities come and go, as do worlds, as do souls.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Hemon\u2019s nightmarish battle scenes, offset by the couple\u2019s ecstatic, defiant sensuality, have a visceral impact. Indeed, these \u201chard and heavy days\u201d of war and desire overshadow the novel\u2019s later acts. After capture by Russians, Pinto and Osman reunite in post-revolutionary Tashkent with baby Rahela (possibly Osman\u2019s daughter) in tow, before dodging Red and White warlords along the Silk Road. Into this lavish tableau of slaughter and adventure, Mr Hemon weaves the yarns of an enigmatic British spy, Major Moser-Ethering. This fruity fabulist, with \u201cfew regrets and no contrition\u201d, may owe something to the style of Marshal Tito\u2019s old pal, Sir Fitzroy Maclean."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Osman vanishes on the plains of Turkestan. His kindly, merry spirit remains a constant guide for Pinto as the story leaps across wars and years in a splintered, lyrical chronicle. Pinto and Rahela join the \u00e9migr\u00e9 flotsam in the Shanghai of the 1930s, their self-fashioned father-daughter bond\u2014sealed by a private argot of Bosnian, Ladino and German\u2014supplying emotional ballast. Mr Hemon\u2019s scene-painting has flair and colour but can feel secondhand: pre-cut backcloth, not background."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pinto loses Rahela to a scheming American until, in 1949, the Communist takeover of China spins fortune\u2019s wheel again. A poignant epilogue, set in Jerusalem in 2001, returns to the frontier zone between fact and fiction, memory and history, where Mr Hemon thrives. His novel encompasses thrilling sequences and flatter patches of period melodrama. Yet within this widescreen epic, he drills as piercingly as ever into the questions of language and freedom, choice and chance, that made the refugee a writer. \u201cYou cannot fathom my rules,\u201d Pinto\u2019s God insists. Literature, and love, must make their own. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
