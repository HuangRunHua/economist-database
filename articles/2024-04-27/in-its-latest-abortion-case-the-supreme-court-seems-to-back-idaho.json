Two years on, that sounds like wishful thinking: the court finds itself right back in the middle of America\u2019s abortion battle. A month ago the issue was access to abortion pills\u2014a fight opponents of abortion seem destined to lose. On April 24th the question was whether state bans that criminalise terminations are trumped by a federal law concerning emergency care. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labour Act (EMTALA), passed in 1986, requires hospitals receiving federal funding to offer \u201cstabilising treatment\u201d to people showing up in their emergency rooms (ERs). In 2022 the Biden administration notified hospitals that this duty includes offering abortion when a woman\u2019s pregnancy poses immediate risks to her health. But a law passed that year\u2014the Idaho Defence of Life Act\u2014prohibits abortion except in cases of rape or incest, or when \u201cnecessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman\u201d. Moyle v United States concerns cases where a woman\u2019s health is at imminent risk but she is not at death\u2019s door."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Joshua Turner, defending Idaho\u2019s statute, faced a barrage from the three liberal justices. Idaho\u2019s law explicitly recognises abortion as the standard of medical care when a woman\u2019s \u201clife is in peril\u201d, Justice Elana Kagan noted. So can\u2019t EMTALA extend that same standard to cases when her \u201chealth is in peril\u201d and she could \u201close her reproductive organs\u201d? Well, Mr Turner said, that raises \u201ctough medical questions that implicate deeply theological and moral questions\u201d that states should answer. \u201cThat would be a good response if federal law did not take a position on what you characterise as a tough question,\u201d Justice Kagan retorted. But EMTALA \u201csays that you don\u2019t have to wait until the person is on the verge of death\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Justice Sonia Sotomayor cited the case of \u201ca real woman\u201d in Florida who was sent home from hospital despite doctors believing she needed an abortion to avoid sepsis and uncontrolled haemorrhage. Doctors \u201crefused to treat her because they couldn\u2019t say she would die.\u201d She later returned to the hospital, after bleeding at home and passing out, and an abortion saved her life. Would Idaho\u2019s law require a woman to endure a similar experience? Mr Turner could not give a clear answer. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson walked Mr Turner through a discourse on the constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, which states that \u201cwhat the federal government says takes precedence\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The court\u2019s conservative justices largely steered clear of questions of women\u2019s reproductive health. But they voiced three lines of attack on the Biden administration\u2019s position, suggesting that their sympathies lay with Idaho. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Justices Samuel Alito, Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas all noted that EMTALA was enacted under the constitution\u2019s Spending Clause and probed whether it was proper for the government to withhold Medicare funds unless emergency abortions are provided. Mr Turner argued that such conditions must be \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d in the statute itself. Elizabeth Prelogar, the solicitor-general, suggested that the court should not consider this argument as the lower courts \u201cdid not address\u201d it. Conservative justices raised the question of conscience exemptions\u2014whether doctors who object to abortion would have to follow a federal mandate. But Ms Prelogar insisted that \u201cindividual doctors are never required to perform an abortion\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One objection to the Biden administration\u2019s position seemed to gain more traction: the worry that adding a health exception via EMTALA would invite a host of elective abortions via mental-health claims. Ms Prelogar strove to allay concerns: it would be \u201cincredibly unethical\u201d to treat a woman who comes to the ER \u201cwith some grave mental-health emergency\u201d by terminating her pregnancy, she said. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, said that, though it \u201cseems like Idaho will prevail\u201d, there is \u201ca lot of ambiguity\u201d about how the justices will justify such a ruling, as all of the pathways explored in the hearing are murky. By contrast, perhaps the starkest moment in the hearing was Justice Kagan\u2019s observation that six women have been airlifted out of state from one Idaho hospital since the law went into effect. \u201cIt can\u2019t be the right standard of care\u201d, she said, \u201cto force somebody into a helicopter.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with The , our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and Checks and Balance, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 27}
