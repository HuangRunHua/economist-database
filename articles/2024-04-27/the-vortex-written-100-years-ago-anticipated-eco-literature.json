Recently Gustavo Petro, Colombia\u2019s leader, praised \u201cLa Vor\u00e1gine\u201d (\u201cThe Vortex\u201d), a novella by Jos\u00e9 Eustasio Rivera, for having words that \u201cstill shine like stars\u201d and showing how \u201cthe destruction of the jungle fills human beings with nothing but hatred\u201d. Mr Petro and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s president, both spoke about \u201cThe Vortex\u201d at the International Book Fair of Bogot\u00e1. This year\u2019s biblio-bonanza is celebrating the relationship between literature and nature, as well as the centenary of the publication of \u201cThe Vortex\u201d, which was written in April 1924."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rivera told his story through Arturo Cova, an equivocal narrator who seduces a woman, Alicia, in Bogot\u00e1 and then flees with her to los llanos in the east.

It also excoriates the abuses that the rubber industry inflicted on indigenous people serving as indentured workers in the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest rainforest. As the forest is despoiled and a tug-of-war plays out between those wanting to prioritise environmental protection over economic growth, the book feels modern and timely."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It can also be read as pioneering eco-literature. Rivera\u2019s vivid, poetic prose transforms the jungle into a living being, \u201ca green hell\u201d that fights back against its persistent invaders. Thundering rapids drown men; ants as poisonous as scorpions prey on human flesh. At one point Cova hears a tree\u2019s vengeful thoughts.

Fortunately, renewed conservation efforts led by Brazil and Colombia are focused on preserving what remains of the Amazon. But plenty of deforestation continues. No one can be sure of what will be left a hundred years from now. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 80}
