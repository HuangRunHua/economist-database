On April 21st Spain\u2019s Basque Country voted in regional elections. The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), the conservative separatist movement that has led the region since 2012, scraped out the barest of wins, tying its rival in the number of seats and eking out a symbolic victory in the number of votes cast. But that rival was EH Bildu, which had its best result ever. The left-wing separatist party is the descendant of the political wing of ETA, a terrorist group that killed hundreds of people across four decades in Spain.

Now it is the region\u2019s second political force, and many Spaniards are horrified.

The PNV will almost certainly re-form its coalition with the regional branch of the national Socialist Party.

That is code for respecting the majority, who oppose independence. Mr Pradales also praised the \u201ctotal normality\u201d (that is, the peaceful nature) of the elections.

Those younger voters have wearied of the PNV\u2019s long rule, increasingly marked by alleged nepotism and favouritism. But they voted for change, not independence; a pre-election poll found that only 13% of Basques favour outright independence, including only a minority of Bildu\u2019s voters.

The outrage his comments sparked caused him to issue a mealy-mouthed apology (\u201cif\u201d he hurt anyone, he was sorry). The uproar was credited not so much with causing voters to flee Bildu as with revving up the other parties\u2019 dispirited bases.

On election night its general secretary Arnaldo Otegi, once convicted for praising terrorism, reminded the audience it claims not just the three provinces of the current Basque Country, but seven \u201chistoric territories\u201d (that is, also including neighbouring Navarre and three old provinces of south-western France). But in a way that simply served as a reminder of how far it is from achieving those original aims. Meanwhile, many of its voters have no memory of ETA\u2019s violence. They want jobs, hospitals and schools. Bildu can keep those voters, or it can rattle Spain with confrontation, but it probably cannot do both. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 42}
