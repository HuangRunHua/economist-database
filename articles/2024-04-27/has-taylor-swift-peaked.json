Five of the ten most popular albums in America in 2023 were hers, according to Luminate, an analytics firm. Ms Swift\u2019s albums have now cumulatively racked up 384 weeks in the top ten of the Billboard chart, beating a record previously held by the Beatles. She is halfway through the most lucrative concert tour ever. A film version of it grossed over $260m at the box office last year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On April 19th she released a double album entitled \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\u201d. Over the course of 31 songs, Ms Swift wields her scalpel and dissects every inch of her recent relationships. Few songwriters have been better at transmuting heartbreak into hits. (\u201cThe high\u201d, as she sang on \u201cBlank Space\u201d, has surely always been \u201cworth the pain\u201d.) Unfortunately, on this album, she has eschewed danceable pop for something as downcast as the title implies. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gone are the irresistibly catchy choruses of \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d and \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d, replaced with dreamy synths, muted drums and languorous vocals. Ms Swift can do melancholy and wistfulness well. Yet \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d is mournful without being memorable. For a woman who launched her career as a precocious country-singing teen, her new lyrics sound jarringly immature, with unimaginative rhymes. \u201cLike I lost my twin / Fuck it if I can\u2019t have him,\u201d she sings in \u201cDown Bad\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is a sign of her stardom that many Swifties rushed to buy the record anyway: within a day of its release \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d sold 1.4m copies in America. But some are breaking ranks to confess that they think the songs are underwhelming and samey. Is Ms Swift falling into the trap that ensnares those who reach the highest echelons of their fields, from auteurs to chief executives? Perhaps no one\u2014including her songwriting collaborators\u2014wants to tell music\u2019s biggest star that her tunes are bland. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On \u201cI Can Do It With A Broken Heart\u201d she boasts that she is \u201cso productive, it\u2019s an art\u201d. Indeed it is quite common for great artists at the height of their fame to release lengthy double albums: think of the Beatles\u2019 30 songs on the \u201cWhite Album\u201d or Bruce Springsteen\u2019s 20 on \u201cThe River\u201d. But both of those could have benefited from more selective editing and still have become the treasured classics that they are today. For Ms Swift, it is the quality of her output, not the quantity, that has set her apart from her peers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Swift\u2019s latest offering is some way short of her usual standard.
