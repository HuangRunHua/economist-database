China\u2019s government is likely to resist any forced sale, and the firm could seek to challenge the law in the courts, arguing that it violates the right to free speech."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The European Commission launched a probe into the medical-device market in China, claiming that European manufacturers face discrimination in procurement processes. Officials also raided the European offices of Nuctech, a Chinese security-equipment supplier, under new anti-subsidy laws.

The US Chamber of Commerce quickly filed a lawsuit challenging the rules in a Texas court. Separately, the FTC sued to stop an $8.5bn retail merger.
