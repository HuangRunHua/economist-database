However, we were surprised to see Steven Levitt and John Donohue reiterating their claim that abortion caused a drop in crime (By Invitation, April 8th). Roe v Wade, the case in 1973 that legalised abortion in America, related only to that country. But the drop in crime was international, occurring in all high-income countries. Abortion was not a factor causing the steep falls in crime observed in Canada, Britain and many other places. Declines in big-volume crimes in America, including burglary and larceny theft, began in 1980 not 1990. This was just seven years after Roe v Wade, so too soon for abortion to have had an impact on adolescent crime."}, {"role": "body", "text": "We have been researching the role of security for many years. Evidence showing the importance of security in generating the reduction in crime has grown. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Levitt and Donohue analysis relied on five states that introduced abortion earlier than 1973. Any effect is probably spurious and related to income. These states had median incomes far above the national average. Higher-income residents replace their cars and renovate or buy new homes more quickly and frequently, buying more and newer security measures. There is scientific consensus on the effectiveness of electronic vehicle-immobilisers in reducing car theft across multiple jurisdictions, and of door deadlocks in reducing break-ins. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "America, followed by other rich countries, experienced what has been termed an avalanche of security in all walks of life. With easy property crimes no longer available, fewer adolescents became involved in crime.

Prospective trials are indeed required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these devices before deployment in clinical environments, especially as the majority of regulator-approved devices are diagnostic. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "However, it is equally as important that studies are well designed, methodologically robust and assess clinically relevant outcomes. AI technology introduces several unique challenges that increase the risk of bias, including how data is sourced and subsequently used to train, validate and test AI algorithms. Global initiatives to harmonise reporting guidelines and quality assessment of diagnostic studies will be crucial to allow clinicians, regulators and health policymakers to determine which AI tools are safe and effective for clinical use."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dr Ahmad GuniClinical research fellowImperial College London"}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are valuable applications of AI in medicine. Replacing the provider with the artificial, even accompanied by an avatar, is not one of them. For the replacement to work, the interventions recommended to the patient would have to be straightforward, single-choice options which the patient would accept. In practical terms, there are usually different options for the patient to select, which are not, in an objective manner, able to be ranked as \u201cbest\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rather, choosing an option requires a discussion with patients that takes an important note of their personal values. Most extreme among these is when patients decide whether to have treatment for their disease or palliative care. Applying their values to these decisions results in vastly different selections, given the otherwise same diagnoses and treatment options. Guiding patients through these decisions requires an ability to establish a personal rapport too nuanced to be replaced by an algorithm. The same inputs could result in potentially quite different care plans from one patient to the next."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dr Brandon SmagloAssociate professor of gastrointestinal medical oncologyUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer CentreHouston"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240330_TQD005.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are two critical barriers to the uptake of AI in health: legal liability and the investment required to train health-care providers to use AI effectively and safely.

It is already a struggle to integrate digital health technology into training.
