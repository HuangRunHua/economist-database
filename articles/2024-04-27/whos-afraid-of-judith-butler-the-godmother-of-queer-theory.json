By Judith Butler. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 320 pages; $30. Allen Lane; \u00a325"}, {"role": "body", "text": "There was a time when outlandish theories about gender were confined to the fringes of social-science faculties. Now such notions\u2014and particularly the idea that sex is mutable\u2014are debated everywhere, from kitchen tables and pubs to state legislatures, thanks to a few academics. Chief among them is Judith Butler of the University of California, Berkeley, known as \u201cthe godmother of queer theory\u201d. As the revolution Butler helped start has recently met with more intellectual and political resistance, the author has written a new book in its defence. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Butler (who prefers to go by the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d) shot to fame in academic circles with \u201cGender Trouble\u201d (1990), a difficult book that some students read and others pretended they had. Drawing on ideas of feminist thinkers, Butler examined concepts of \u201csex\u201d (the biological categories of male and female) and \u201cgender\u201d (the behaviours associated with those categories). Butler argued that gender is \u201cperformative\u201d rather than defined by sex; terms such as \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d were not helpful and should be reimagined. \u201cGender Trouble\u201d has become part of the post-modern social-science canon."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Butler grew up in a world where many held rigid views about how men and women should look and behave. As a lesbian who faced homophobia after coming out in the 1970s, Butler asked why a woman had to be feminine and desire men, and a man be masculine and desire women. Butler went on to develop queer theory\u2014an ideology that says that gender identity trumps biological sex in defining who a person is\u2014promoting this concept in notoriously impenetrable academic prose. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Gender?\u201d is Butler\u2019s first non-academic book, and much of it is surprisingly lucid. That is partly because the subject matter is less the wilder fringes of gender and more the mean streets of political activism. The author calls out religious leaders who treat gay people as second-class citizens and details the appalling way they are still discriminated against in the developing world. Butler correctly points to the moral panic that discussions of \u201cgender\u201d can engender on the political right (and rails against Donald Trump and his opportunism in this regard) and, crucially, draws attention to people struggling with dysphoria and the historical prejudices they have suffered. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The problem is that pretty soon, the author leaves the path of gay-rights advocacy and disappears down an ideological rabbit hole. Soon after critiques of \u201cthe so-called facts of sex\u201d, the TQ+ overwhelms the LGB. The result is a stir-fry of disingenuous provocations, served up with a large portion of post-modern word salad. The reader is left wondering how Butler ever became so influential."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the introduction, the author writes that pushback is driven by something stronger than a backlash against progressive movements, namely \u201cthe restoration of a patriarchal dream-order\u201d. Rather than methodically taking on critics\u2019 arguments, Butler assails them\u2014for instance the \u201coutmoded science\u201d that says males should not compete in women\u2019s sport. Then Butler goes on to place gender in the same basket as women\u2019s rights, gay rights and legal abortion, suggesting that anyone who asserts the importance of biological sex must be against those things. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Butler smears the growing army of liberal-minded women who oppose these views on sex and gender, including J.K. Rowling, as hysterical right-wingers allied with the pope, Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin. Soon the author descends into the quicksand of intersectionality, where all oppressions overlap, accusing people who criticise the Butler perspective of buttressing \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d. By the end, all opponents are extremists. The words \u201cfascism\u201d and \u201cfascist\u201d appear nearly 70 times. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The book is a lesson in how well-meaning activism can overreach. The author has lent intellectual credibility to a theory that has, as recently revealed in the Cass Review commissioned about England\u2019s youth-gender services, caused harm to many young people, some of whom are autistic, depressed or simply gay. Channelling Butler\u2019s theories, some activists are labelling those who oppose giving minors cross-sex hormones as \u201cbigots\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is hurting the causes that Butler once stood for. It is not just conservatives and populists who are increasingly alienated. The policies that have resulted from Butler\u2019s ideas are troubling folk in middle America, who support the right of all to live as they wish but worry about ideological brainwashing and the safeguarding of women and children. This is pushing them to the right politically. Butler asks who is afraid of gender. It is the wrong question. What a growing number of liberal people object to is not an abstract noun but the real-world consequences of the muddled thinking that the author typifies. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 77}
