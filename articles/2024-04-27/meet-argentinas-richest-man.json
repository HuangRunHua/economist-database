At 17, Marcos Galperin had returned from a tour playing competitive rugby in Australia and New Zealand, two egg-chasing powerhouses, when he was offered a place at the University of Pennsylvania to study business. \u201cI had to make a choice,\u201d recalls the 52-year-old founder of Mercado Libre, Latin America\u2019s dominant e-commerce and payments firm, from his office in Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital. But old dreams die hard. \u201cIf I were to be born again I would definitely go for a sports career,\u201d says Mr Galperin. Still, being a billionaire has its compensations. Last year he bought the Miami Sharks, a rugby team in the United States. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Argentina\u2019s rugby team could have used a handy fly-half in the 1990s, but both Mr Galperin\u2019s home country and Latin America are much better off for his choice of business. It is hard to overstate Mercado Libre\u2019s impact. In a region of 670m people, the firm counted 218m active users last year. They buy and sell goods online, and use Mercado Pago, the firm\u2019s payments arm, to pay for everything from roadside snacks to football tickets. Mr Galperin is the mega-star of Latin America\u2019s technology scene. With a net worth of over $6bn he is one of the region\u2019s wealthiest men. Already powerful in business, he is increasingly outspoken on social media. "}], "id": 37}
