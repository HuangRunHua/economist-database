He loved his first year and says he \u201cfelt great as a Jewish student at Columbia\u201d. But since the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th, the atmosphere on campus has changed. Within days there were protests. He heard students calling for an intifada. He kept being told: \u201cYou\u2019re interpreting it wrong\u201d, but this week there was no misinterpreting, he says, the undercurrent of antisemitism on campus. \u201cWe\u2019re coming for you,\u201d other Jewish students say they were told: \u201cGet off our campus.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "University presidents are struggling with policing free speech on campus: how to deal with pro-Palestinian protests?

This was an \u201calarming decision\u201d, wrote Jameel Jaffer, from the university\u2019s free-speech centre, adding that \u201cit was not evident to us how the encampment and protest posed such a danger\u201d as to justify the escalation. According to the New York Police Department (NYPD), the arrested protesters were peaceful and offered no resistance. \u201cIt was so scary,\u201d says Layla Saliba, who saw the arrests. \u201cAll these cops just swarming everywhere and we had people in like full riot gear.\u201d Within days another encampment sprang up on a nearby lawn."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a letter posted on Columbia\u2019s website Minouche Shafik, Columbia\u2019s president, wrote that she asked the NYPD to intervene after other efforts failed: she did so \u201cout of an abundance of concern for the safety of Columbia\u2019s campus\u201d. The move only inflamed matters. \u201cThe irony is that in trying to quiet things down and assert control over the encampment, the administration unleashed this firestorm,\u201d says David Pozen, a law professor at the university."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That firestorm spread, with tent encampments popping up far beyond Columbia. The demands by student protesters are largely the same: divest endowments from Israeli firms and any weapons manufacturers that sell there; end academic partnerships with Israeli institutions; and condemn Israel\u2019s actions in the war. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As at Columbia, administrators elsewhere are overcoming their reluctance to call the cops. On April 22nd nearly 50 protesters were charged with trespassing for taking part in a week-long occupation of a plaza at Yale (protesters returned the next day). At New York University police broke up a copycat encampment, arresting more than 130. At the University of Texas dozens were arrested after state troopers in riot gear swept through the campus. \u201cThese protesters belong in jail,\u201d Texas\u2019s governor, Greg Abbott, wrote on X. Police clashed with protesters as they attempted to clear the campus at the University of Southern California (USC).

The New York Civil Liberties Union has sued over the move. Equally controversial was USC\u2019s decision to cancel the graduation speech of its pro-Palestinian valedictorian, who is Muslim; the school cited safety threats. USC has since cancelled all guest speakers at commencement."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Presiding over an American university was once a plum job; now it is a minefield. On April 17th Dr Shafik was the latest president to be grilled by the House Education Committee about antisemitism on campus. Unlike the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, who fumbled their appearances in December, Dr Shafik survived\u2014for now. When asked the question that both Claudine Gay, at Harvard, and Elizabeth Magill, at Pennsylvania, had struggled with (whether calling for the genocide of Jews violated their university\u2019s code of conduct), she and her colleagues answered simply: \u201cYes, it does.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Critics say she has not defended free speech adequately. The university\u2019s rules, wrote Mr Jaffer, guarantee broad protection \u201ceven for speech that is objectionable or offensive to some listeners\u201d.

Donors are restive and politicians are circling: on April 24th the House speaker, Mike Johnson, visited Columbia and said calling in the National Guard should be an option.
