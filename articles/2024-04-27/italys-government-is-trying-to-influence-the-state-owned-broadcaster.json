His historical novel \u201cM: Son of the Century\u201d won the Strega prize, Italy\u2019s most prestigious literary award, and has been widely translated. It was the first in a series that chronicles the rise and fall of Italy\u2019s fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini. So Mr Scurati was an obvious choice to give a talk on RAI, Italy\u2019s public broadcasting network, ahead of April 25th, the public holiday that marks the country\u2019s liberation from fascism in 1945."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Mr Scurati never got to read it on air. RAI withdrew its commission. Mr Scurati said it was because it was critical of Giorgia Meloni and her refusal to disown the fascist past. RAI said that the reason was that he had demanded too high a fee. Ms Meloni responded with her usual deftness, claiming she did not know who was right and publishing the text of Mr Scurati\u2019s talk on her Facebook page. Not that that was necessary: it had already been published in the press, from where it went viral on social media."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The controversy erupted against the background of a campaign by Ms Meloni\u2019s supporters to redress what they see as RAI\u2019s leftist bias. The neo-fascist fore-runners of her Brothers of Italy (FdI) party were long treated as political outcasts. \u201cMany of them hold the view that now it\u2019s revenge time,\u201d says Gianni Riotta, who teaches media studies at LUISS, a leading university in Rome. For her critics, their activities show that Ms Meloni, who has so far pursued a generally pragmatic course, is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing: that her long-term aim is to take Italy down a road already trodden by her friend the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, who has virtually excluded criticism of his government from public media. Reacting to an earlier controversy over the rules for coverage of the European election, the main trade union representing the RAI journalists declared that the government was bent on using it as its \u201cmegaphone\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Italy\u2019s public broadcaster has never achieved the independence of Britain\u2019s BBC or America\u2019s PBS. Until the 1990s, each of its three TV channels was earmarked for one of the main parties. Since then, every incoming government has tried to pack the corporation with its supporters. The consequences have always been more drastic if the government of the day leans to the right, as it does now: since the three biggest private channels form part of the Mediaset network, founded by the conservative Silvio Berlusconi, the right then attains a near-monopoly of what the nation sees on its small screens."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Meloni\u2019s followers, however, seem bent on exploiting that advantage to an unprecedented degree. The European Parliament election guidelines for RAI will allow more time on air to ministers than to representatives of the opposition. The text approved by the parliamentary committee that oversees the corporation says that the usual proportional allocation of time can be overridden in the name of \u201cguaranteeing the public timely information on institutional and governmental activities\u201d. It has even been suggested that this means that ministers might be able to talk for as long as they like on RAI discussion shows."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That said, at least two factors stand in the way of a Hungarian-style monopolisation of the narrative. The first is the need to show programmes the public will watch. Several leading TV personalities have already left RAI for private channels not beholden to the Berlusconi family, of which there are a growing number. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A second challenge is presented by the sheer volume of contemporary media. Young Italians in particular are more likely to be tapping into TikTok or Instagram than switching on RAI or Mediaset. And in any case, the influence of the two giants of the Italian airwaves was always debatable. \u201cSilvio Berlusconi lost two elections,\u201d notes Mr Riotta. \u201cAnd on each occasion he controlled both Mediaset and RAI.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 39}
