It was the same gag Mr Farage used during a gloating speech in the European Parliament after the Brexit vote. Mr Farage himself appears only to flirt with a comeback. \u201cDo I stick with this really very comfortable life?\u201d he teased guests at his 60th birthday party, attended by a ragbag of friendly journalists, fringe Conservative politicians and Liz Truss, and breathlessly reported in the press. \u201cI have genuinely not made up my mind.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Reform UK \u2018s only MP comes in the form of Lee Anderson, who defected from the Tories in March.

Pull the other one. Mr Anderson was briefly portrayed as a voice of the forgotten voter. In reality he was a chancer, enjoying a few months of celebrity and a \u00a3100,000 ($124,000) salary for appearing on GB News, a right-wing news channel.

As a result a party with few candidates, an absent leader and a voting base conjured up by incessant polling is still able to panic the Conservatives.

A normal party, with candidates and policies, can be crushed or ignored. Reform UK is a spectre that can be summoned by right-wing Conservative mps at will, whenever the party threatens to edge towards the centre. It has what Mark Fisher, a leftie writer, called the \u201cagency of the virtual\u201d\u2014the ability to affect things merely by polluting the minds of others, rather than by altering reality directly.
