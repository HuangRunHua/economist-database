New roads crisscross the state. up\u2019s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a keen follower of Mr Modi, is clearing red tape and cracking down on crime to attract business.

It is one in which all the 28 states are capable of competing against each other economically, giving business leaders opportunities beyond the prosperous south."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are signs that this is happening.

But overall growth during Mr Modi\u2019s tenure has not been remarkable by the country\u2019s standards since it embarked on a path of liberalisation in the early 1990s. That was when India\u2019s elites decided that the highly regulated socialist system (the \u201clicence raj\u201d) of the decades following independence needed wholesale reform, a process which has played out with remarkable continuity, despite changing political tides. Over three decades of reform, growth has averaged 6.4% a year. Though it has averaged 5.6% during the decade of Mr Modi\u2019s rule, that has been in line with a broader slowdown in global growth.

Since 2021 India has been the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy, and 6.5% growth would be more than twice the global average. If that average stays around 3%, India would account for 15% or more of the total this decade. But compared with other countries in the recent past, the rate might seem disappointing. East Asian countries grew at rates above 10% in their heyday. China and India had similar incomes per person in the 1980s. China is now five times richer.

The East Asian countries benefited from huge inflows of foreign investment and the exports of a job-rich low-skill manufacturing sector. That helped them deepen their links to global value chains at a time of rampant globalisation. India\u2019s rise began later and followed a different path. That is hardly a surprise; in its size, religious and linguistic variety, it is unique. Governmental responsibilities are divided between the centre and the states in ways that make rapid reform tricky. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "India\u2019s path has, therefore, been singular: its exports have been led not by manufacturing but by a productive yet job-poor it and services sector, and its companies are led by a handful of sprawling conglomerates along with a long tail of small informal businesses. Sustaining growth rates of 6% or more would be consequential. Goldman Sachs, a bank, expects India to become the world\u2019s third-largest national economy this decade. Bump growth rates up just half a percentage point, cross your fingers and extrapolate wildly and it could even reach the number-one spot by 2070 (see chart 1), though it would still only be half as rich as China and a quarter as rich as America per person (see chart 2)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To achieve that growth, and have a fighting chance of boosting it, the future must look different. Because of the country\u2019s remarkable diversity, there is no simple national nostrum. It will need everything from increasing competitiveness in labour-intensive sectors like textiles to growing prowess in high-tech sectors that blend services and manufacturing. That will require a deeper single market to boost domestic business, more innovation to export at the global frontier, and a stronger state that delivers on basic services to ensure India\u2019s copious young talent is unleashed."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Cleaning up"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Modi\u2019s two terms have seen progress on some of this. The financial sector has been cleaned up and enjoys growing global credibility. The corporate sector has a return on equity above the global average. That reflects a healthier business environment, including a national goods-and-services tax, introduced in 2017, that works across state lines and creates revenues which exceed those of the old state-based system. Public-infrastructure investment is surging (see chart 3); the national road network has grown by 60% over ten years, double the rate of the previous decade.

Building up the national identity system called Aadhaar, begun by the previous government, has laid the foundation for a payment system that 300m Indians use every month (see chart 4).

The labour market is weak, with a majority of Indians underemployed or out of the labour force altogether. That limits consumption, and exports do not make up the shortfall. Indian education is partly to blame and cities lack the governance needed to accommodate vast shifts of people from rural to urban areas, a potential boon for productivity. Tackling these issues needs a lot more co-operation between central and state governments than financial reform does, and better relations with state governments have not been Mr Modi\u2019s strong suit. Some, like up\u2019s, are led by politicians of the prime minister\u2019s stamp. Many are not."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Modi\u2019s muscular management style has had some benefits, not least pushing through some big national projects. It has also strayed into bullying and an increasingly authoritarian approach. Yet the country\u2019s basic political structure is still democratic, so consensus-building will be needed. Thirty years of reform have laid a foundation for India to reach scale. To achieve its potential, a new agenda just as ambitious as that of 1991 is needed. In surveying the landscape to ascertain where India is heading, a good place to start is where it has turned weakness into strength: the financial sector. \u25a0"}], "id": 53}
