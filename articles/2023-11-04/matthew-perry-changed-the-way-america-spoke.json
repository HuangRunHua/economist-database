The emphasis has changed\u2014and emphasis is what matters in comedy. He\u2019d always known that. The words, the sentence, the scene can be the same but alter the emphasis\u2014lean a little harder on this word, push a little on that one\u2014and the joke is transformed. He and his friends had played with this when they were at school. They\u2019d developed their own way of speaking. \u201cCould it be any hotter?\u201d they\u2019d ask. \u201cCould the teacher be any meaner?\u201d It changed everything. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Emphasis was always his thing\u2014it had got him the part in the first place. Everyone had wanted to be in \u201cFriends Like Us\u201d but in the audition it was he who had nailed it, reading the words in that unexpected way, \u201chitting emphases that no one else had hit\u201d; making everyone laugh. It was less that he, Matthew Perry, could play Chandler than that he was Chandler. He changed the part\u2014and then the part changed him. Fame, fortune, money followed. And above all, The Big Terrible Thing. The thing so big, so terrible that it would demand emphatic capitals; cause him to return to rehab 14 times\u2014and change the emphasis of those jokes for ever. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Watch \u201cFriends\u201d after everything that happened and suddenly it seemed different: not simply a sitcom but a chronicle of his decline. Take that episode in season three, the one titled \u201cThe One With The Hypnosis Tape\u201d. Later people saw it instead as The One Where You Could See How Thin He Was. By then, he was addicted to opioids which had left him vomiting and all but unable to eat. Anyone watching that season should, he thought, be \u201chorrified\u201d by his thinness. Everywhere, hindsight makes the lines land differently. Take that episode in season one, where a shrink turns up and starts to analyse him. \u201cYou\u2019re so funny,\u201d the shrink says to Chandler. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be there when the laughter stops.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFriends\u201d was not how he wanted to be remembered. Though he did definitely want to be remembered\u2014on that he was clear. Before that first audition he\u2019d fallen to his knees, eyes closed. \u201cGod, you can do whatever you want to me,\u201d he had prayed. \u201cJust please make me famous.\u201d God seems to have listened, as success on a different scale followed. Ever after he would be a man to be measured in millions: 22m watched the pilot episode. More than 50m watched a single, star-studded episode in series two. By series eight, he was making $1m an episode. \u201cBut the Almighty, being the Almighty, had not forgotten the first part of that prayer as well.\u201d He would later spend over $7m in rehab. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But before that there was the success. Which was staggering. \u201cFriends Like Us\u201d became first \u201cFriends\u201d then, for its fans, almost \u201cfriends\u201d. Television was still consumed en masse then and for a time a whole generation seemed to know which Friend they \u201cwere\u201d: the nerdy one (Ross); the pretty one (Rachel)\u2014or the funny one: him. It was less a programme than a paradigm; people started copying everything about them: their hair (\u201cThe Rachel cut\u201d was particularly popular); their syntax (the definite article gained a newfound celebrity\u2014\u201cThe This\u201d; \u201cThe That\u201d). Even English intonation itself bent before the show. It was, he thought, surely not an exaggeration to say that Chandler had changed how America spoke. Could its influence be any more clear? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And each week, tens of millions of Americans sat on couches to watch the Friends sit on their couches. Which was ironic, in a way, as he had always loathed sitting at home on couches. Performing in front of thousands\u2014that he could do. But put him alone \u201con my couch in front of a TV for the night and I get scared.\u201d Being on his own had always frightened him. His parents had split up when he was small. When he was five, his mother had put him on a plane, alone, to go and see his father in Los Angeles. He had snacks, and priority boarding, and fancy lounges. He had perks; but no parents. He\u2019d been terrified. Later, as a famous actor, he\u2019d get some of the same airport perks again. He hated them then, too. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the end, it was alcohol that comforted him. When he was 14, he and some friends had got a six-pack of Budweiser and a bottle of white wine. His friends had just got drunk\u2014but he had got a sudden, overwhelming sense of well-being. At last, he knew that he was taken care of; at last he knew it was all fine. It was bliss. After that, there were more drugs, more bliss and, after a neck injury, there were opioids. They were better yet: \u201clike replacing your blood with warm honey\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then the bliss faded. Watch \u201cFriends\u201d now and you can tell the state of his addictions by his appearance: chunky\u2014that\u2019s the alcohol. Skinny\u2014that\u2019s pills. The goatee? That was lots of pills. Eventually the opioids would give him such severe constipation that his colon exploded and he passed out. \u201cI was so full of shit it almost killed me.\u201d There was still humour, of a sort. He would later learn that while he was unconscious there had been a debate about whether he should be taken to a different clinic. The different clinic thought not: it apparently took one look at his chart and said: \u201cMatthew Perry is not dying in our hospital.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is odd, he later wrote, \u201cto live in a world where if you died, it would shock people but surprise no one.\u201d He was right about the shock. People were often shocked by him. They were shocked when they saw him in life: he looked so old. Those who had watched \u201cFriends\u201d the first time around were shocked afresh when it was re-aired on Netflix in 2015; though this time the shock was not at his age but their own. It all looked so dated: the hair; the ties; the staginess; the whiteness. How had we not realised that we had been living in the past? That time had been passing so quickly? For millions, he became less a man than a memento mori. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Perry himself needed no reminders about death. He had been to death\u2019s door, and back. Although that wasn\u2019t quite the emphasis he gave it\u2014and for him emphasis, as always, mattered. He had started writing his memoir on his phone; it finally came out last year. And from its first pages it was clear where he wanted to lay the stress. Not on death, after all; but life. \u201cI am alive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThose three words are more miraculous than you might imagine\u2026I am alive.\u201d \u25a0"}], "id": 75}
