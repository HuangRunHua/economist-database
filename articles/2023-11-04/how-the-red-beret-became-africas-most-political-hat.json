A man of personal modesty and striking looks, he refused to let his portrait be hung in public buildings. But in death his image is everywhere on the pan-African left. He first wore the red beret because he was a soldier (who staged a coup). He said he later took inspiration from Che Guevara, to whom he is often compared."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, an army captain who led a coup in Burkina Faso last year, mimics Sankara\u2019s rhetoric and headgear.

Omoyele Sowore, a Nigerian activist, has contrasted his orange beret with the black ones worn by police officers, who have a reputation for brutality. Yet the cap can also make one a target of the state. In Uganda, beret-topped followers of Mr Wine have been convicted by army courts for wearing military uniforms, an offence that can lead to life imprisonment.

For many young Africans who look across the continent and see that promises of democracy, equality and dignity are unfulfilled, the beret is surely a symbol of a revolution that is not yet complete. For many others, though, it may simply be that it is, as Mr Wine has said, \u201cmore fashionable\u201d than dowdy sun hats worn by Yoweri Museveni, his ageing adversary\u2014and by their parents.\u25a0"}], "id": 34}
