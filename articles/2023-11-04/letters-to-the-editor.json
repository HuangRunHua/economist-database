In architecture, the work of Antoni Gaud\u00ed i Cornet shows how the creativeness, vision and craft of a genius can live on and be completed according to his original designs 100 years after his death. Gaud\u00ed was a renowned architect in Barcelona when he was appointed as the chief designer for the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia basilica in 1883. He completely changed the designs, everything from the external structure to the details of the interior, and attracted a group of designers, architects and craftspeople to work with him according to his designs.
