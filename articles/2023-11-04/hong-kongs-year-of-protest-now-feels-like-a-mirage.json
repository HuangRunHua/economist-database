On that evening scores of gang members, known as triads, stormed Yuen Long, a rural metro station. There, in train carriages and on concourses, they set upon anyone they suspected of returning from that day\u2019s pro-democracy protests."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gwyneth Ho, then a 28-year-old journalist for Stand News, an online-news site, rushed to the station to livestream the violence. Even as triads beat her to the ground with bamboo sticks, she managed to keep filming. That bravery made Ms Ho\u2019s name and eventually propelled her into politics. However, the authorities were no longer willing to tolerate opposition: they locked her up and shut down Stand News. The trial of Ms Ho, who stands accused of endangering \u201cnational security\u201d, is ongoing. The verdicts for her and 46 other activists being tried on similar charges alongside her are expected later this year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Ho is one of four pro-democracy activists followed in \u201cAmong the Braves\u201d, a book by Shibani Mahtani, a Washington Post journalist, and Timothy McLaughlin, who writes on Hong Kong for the Atlantic. (The authors are married.) Through this quartet the book traces the arc of a protest movement that had begun with optimism and enjoyed mostly unswerving support among the territory\u2019s 7.5m people, but which ended in recrimination and defeat. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The week before the Yuen Long attack, over 1m Hong Kongers had taken to the streets to try to defend their freedom. The movement was cleaved between those advocating wo, lei, fei (peaceful, rational, non-violent) protests and the front-line \u201cBraves\u201d, who favoured more confrontation. Among those who crossed the divide was Tommy. The mild-mannered teenager turned up to his first protest armed with nothing but two cartons of eggs, with which he planned to pelt government buildings. Within weeks he had stormed and occupied Hong Kong\u2019s parliament. Within a year, by then a fugitive, he was planning a daring escape from Hong Kong aboard a speedboat bound for Taiwan. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hong Kongers\u2019 dreams of democracy were snuffed out in 2020, as China\u2019s Communist Party took advantage of the pandemic, which put an end to street protests, to foist a draconian national-security law on its troublesome territory. But the movement had already begun to collapse.

Abandoning this strategy proved disastrous. In November 2019 hardcore protesters holed up in Polytechnic University following a riot. When police laid siege to the campus for days and rounded them up, the movement had been stripped of its most determined warriors.

With the most vocal activists having fled or been locked up, today all that remains are trampled hopes and suppressed memories.
