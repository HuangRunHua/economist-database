Activists projected the words onto a wall of a university in Washington, DC."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What do they mean? Superficially an idealistic vow of liberation, the decades-old expression also contains a threat: the river is the River Jordan, the sea is the Mediterranean and freedom, in this case, implies the destruction of the state of Israel. That is certainly the sense in which Hamas uses the phrase. The children chanting it at the base of Nelson\u2019s column in London on October 21st, during a big pro-Palestinian march, may not have grasped the menace. But several marchers who were yelling the words, or bearing them on placards, seemed aware of it, clamming up defensively when asked to explain them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cAnyone who\u2019s paying attention knows exactly what that means,\u201d says Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League, an American anti-hate group which, like watchdogs in Britain and elsewhere, has documented a steep rise in antisemitic incidents since Hamas\u2019s bloody raid on Israel on October 7th. (Islamophobic incidents have multiplied in several countries, too.) The ubiquity of this deceptively hardline mantra points up an important shift in Western attitudes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Three related forces are driving it: technology, demography and ideology."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Western left once sympathised with Zionism. That changed markedly after the six-day war of 1967 and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Especially since the end of apartheid in South Africa, the Palestinian cause has been a talismanic issue for left-leaning Westerners. Why it acquired this status is a matter of debate. In some analyses, Israel serves as an avatar for American power, or for bygone colonial struggles. Jewish groups and others have wondered why the casualties in, say, Syria or Afghanistan\u2014where the perpetrators as well as the victims are Muslim\u2014stir less bien-pensant concern."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After a period in which the issue receded in prominence in Western diplomacy and headlines, Gaza\u2019s plight is now inspiring protests and disputes as never before. A glut of open letters by artists and other luminaries have decried Israel\u2019s bombardment and Western leaders\u2019 acquiescence to it. (Counter-petitions mourn the atrocities of October 7th and affirm Israel\u2019s right to self-defence.) Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held in many cities, including some where they were notionally banned. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The recriminations flow both ways. In Britain the BBC\u2019s reluctance to refer to Hamas as \u201cterrorists\u201d led to an outcry and a partial climbdown.

Some American students have been hounded for their stridently anti-Israel views; talks by Palestinian authors have been cancelled.

A range of institutions, from universities to unions, have been berated for the wording of their public statements, or for failing to issue one. Calls for peace have been likened to appeasement. And supporters of both Israel and the Palestinians make analogies with Ukraine to show the supposed hypocrisy of the opposing camp. Backers of the Palestinians see Gaza as the victim (like Ukraine) of invasion by a bullying neighbour. Pro-Israelis point to Hamas\u2019s incursion and liken its barbarity to Russian war crimes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The polarised passions and viral slogans are in part a sharp manifestation of the echo-chamber effect of social media. Millions of people have watched footage of Hamas\u2019s depredations in horror. Many others are transfixed instead by images of Gaza\u2019s agony. In Germany, for instance, where a synagogue has been firebombed and Stars of David daubed on Jewish homes, some Islamists exist in \u201cparallel societies\u201d, relying on digital and overseas news, says Felix Klein, the federal commissioner for antisemitism. So, he adds, do many on the far right, which commits most of the country\u2019s antisemitic crimes.

In the past, notes Yunus Ulusoy of the Centre for Turkish Studies and Integration Research in Essen, the Muslim population in Germany was of predominantly Turkish origin. Now, he says, around 2.1m Muslims in the country have roots in Syria, Iraq and other places that are hostile to Israel.

It has a traumatic recent history of Islamist terrorism, and a more distant one of collaboration with the Nazis, both of which tend to bolster support for Israel. But it also harbours contrary strains of anti-Americanism and guilt over French colonialism in the Arab world. The result, says Mr Mo\u00efsi, is a \u201cconflict of memories\u201d that plays out in politics and on the streets."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In America, the most influential depiction of Israel in popular culture is probably \u201cExodus\u201d.

It turns confounding issues into simple clashes of good and evil, conferring a halo of virtue on those who pick the right side. As Yascha Mounk, author of \u201cThe Identity Trap\u201d, argues, the emerging ideology offers just this form of comfort, sorting the world into opposing categories\u2014coloniser and colonised, oppressors and oppressed\u2014often along racial lines. In essence it transposes the terms of American debates over race onto other places and problems. \u201cThe American brand of anti-colonialism\u201d, quips Mr Mounk, \u201cis astonishingly colonialist.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a polarised age, lots of people infer their opinions from their political allegiance rather than the other way round. This, thinks Mr Mounk, is part of the new ideology\u2019s appeal: it furnishes an all-purpose vocabulary to apply to any conflict. In this schema, the powerless can do no wrong, least of all to the powerful\u2014and nobody can be both. Liberation movements of all kinds are linked, as communist insurgencies purported to be during the cold war. As flares in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off at Piccadilly Circus, a protester in London holding a \u201cQueers for Palestine\u201d sign explained that \u201cAll the struggles are connected.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This philosophy is tailor-made for the posturing and character-limits of social-media posts, perhaps one reason it is gaining adherents. But it prohibits the balance and nuanced judgments that intractable real-world hostilities demand. In particular, because the Palestinians are cast as powerless, and Israel is classed as powerful, it follows that Israelis cannot qualify as victims. Never mind the exile of Mizrahi Jews from Arab countries to Israel. The Holocaust is ancient history."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The schema shows up glaringly in references to Hamas\u2019s crimes as a form of \u201cresistance\u201d or \u201cdecolonisation\u201d, and in the statement by some Harvard students that held Israel \u201centirely responsible\u201d for the slaughter of its own citizens. Many Jews, in Israel and the diaspora, perceive a wider disregard for Israel\u2019s suffering\u2014not just less sympathy than it received during, say, the Entebbe hostage crisis of 1976, but a void. If the issue is morally simple, meanwhile, for many Western activists the remedy is blunt and drastic: not the two-state solution of yore, but a Palestine that stretches \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the left-leaning political elite, the picture is starkly different. Both Mr Biden and Sir Keir Starmer, leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party, have offered Israel staunch support. All the same, the escalation in some rank-and-file attitudes to the war may have a lasting fallout\u2014both in the Middle East and in the West. Mr Biden, Sir Keir and other leaders have been lambasted by some in their parties for declining to call for a ceasefire. This disapproval\u2014often motivated by natural compassion for Palestinian civilians rather than ideology\u2014may cost them votes, Muslim and otherwise, in what may be tight elections next year.

Plenty of liberal voters are dismayed by the responses of people with whom, in the past, they felt broadly aligned. Their coalition with more radical voters was already under pressure; for some liberals, the bedrock of common values that they thought underpinned it seems to have crumbled. If the debate over Gaza has been a symptom of polarisation in the West, it may yet prove to be a cause of realignment, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The consequences for Israel and the Middle East are unpredictable. At least in the short term, revulsion for Hamas seems to outweigh any qualms Americans might have had before the war over Israel\u2019s rightward lurch under Binyamin Netanyahu. Most Americans, including most Democrats, tell pollsters that supporting Israel is in American interests. How far and how long that remains the case depends on a series of unknowns\u2014starting with the conduct and outcome of the ground invasion of Gaza, and the new dispensation that may follow.
