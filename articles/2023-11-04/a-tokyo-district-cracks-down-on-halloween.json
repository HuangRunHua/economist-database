Yet on Halloween the capital\u2019s top tourist attraction traditionally takes it up a gear. For years crowds of partygoers in fancy dress have filled Shibuya\u2019s neon-lit streets and celebrated Scramble Crossing. In 2019 around 40,000 flocked to the district on Halloween. But this October 31st the mood was much less joyous. The killjoys of Shibuya\u2019s local government had banned Halloween festivities in the ward."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unwelcoming signs were plastered all over it, including a billboard reading: \u201cNo events for Halloween on Shibuya streets\u201d. Outside the district\u2019s metro station, a famous meeting-place, security guards blew whistles and hustled away anyone tempted to linger. Most monstrous to Shibuya devotees, police sealed off the spot\u2019s iconic statue of Hachiko, a legendary Japanese dog known for its loyalty. \u201cWe came here to see Hachiko. How could they do this?\u201d complained Olga, 31, a Russian tourist, looking disconsolately at the boarded-up dog."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The crackdown was in response to a Halloween tragedy last year in Seoul, in which over 150 people were crushed to death. Officials feared Shibuya\u2019s narrow alleys could see another disaster. According to Fukuda Mitsuru, a crisis-management expert, the fact that Halloween festivities are a fairly recent foreign import exacerbated such concerns."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the curbs are part of a broader crackdown on fun-seeking in Shibuya. Complaining of excessive noise and litter, the ward banned public alcohol consumption at certain times. Such measures seem unobjectionable in isolation. Drunken salarymen lying prostrate on pavements is a less edifying Tokyo spectacle. But combined with the Halloween ban they look to many like an overreaction against youthful spirits by heavy-handed and often aged officials."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That was certainly the view of those carousers who did bravely make it to Shibuya this week. \u201cI come to Shibuya every year for Halloween, so I feel betrayed,\u201d said Takeuchi Tetsuya, wearing a Mickey Mouse costume.\u25a0"}], "id": 16}
