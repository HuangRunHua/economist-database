Whose speech did these ideologues imagine would wind up getting suppressed?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This tension has not surfaced often on college campuses, at least not at the most exclusive schools. There, the forces of capitalism and white privilege\u2014if not of tolerance and curiosity\u2014were mostly routed. A dwindling minority of faculty members, as few as a tenth, identify as conservative. Administrators, whose ranks have ballooned and who oversee the \u201cbias-response teams\u201d that police speech, are even more likely to identify with the left."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet off campus, the forces of reaction began responding with strikingly symmetrical concerns about speech: conservative governors and legislatures across America have embraced the theory that certain ideas are too dangerous for all minds and certain views are too hurtful for particular ears. Bills proposed in states such as Texas seek to protect children from material that might cause \u201cdiscomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex\u201d. But rather than aiming to safeguard the feelings of people from historically marginalised groups, such bills are meant to protect white children from the very ideas the left wants to promulgate.

On prestigious campuses, the war in Gaza has shaken the prevailing power relationships, for the moment. Students attacking Israel for its response to the terrorism of Hamas have come under withering criticism, and worse: some have seen job offers rescinded or had their names and photos flashed on billboards paraded by trucks around their campuses.

For years, leading lights of the left insisted there was no such thing as a glibly censorious \u201ccancel culture\u201d. They liked to speak instead of an \u201caccountability culture\u201d, or a \u201cculture of consequence\u201d that justly punished offensive speakers.

A recent Harvard/Harris poll showed 51% of Americans between 18 and 24 believed Hamas\u2019s rampage could be \u201cjustified\u201d by Palestinians\u2019 grievances. Still, some may not realise, when they chant for a Palestine \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d, that they are advocating ethnic cleansing. But that is the message received by many Jews and others, and an argument of leftists uneasy with debate has been that the impact on the listener, rather than the intent of the speaker, should guide judgment of offensiveness. By that measure alone, it should be harder now for those sympathetic to pro-Palestine students to argue that any \u201chate speech\u201d is off limits. University presidents are in effect embracing this standard by defending the right of these protesters to speak up.
