As temperatures dropped and clouds heavy with brown particulate matter drifted in from neighbouring states, the official rating of air quality in India\u2019s capital went from \u201cpoor\u201d to \u201cvery poor\u201d and then \u201csevere\u201d in places. This means that Delhi\u2019s air, the most polluted of any big city, is now hazardous to breathe even for healthy people. It is likely to remain so for much of the next three months."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Air pollution in South Asia is estimated to claim over 2m lives a year. Partly caused by agricultural practices, including stubble burning, it is most severe in northern India, especially in winter, when cold air traps pollutants in the mostly windless Indo-Gangetic Plain bordered by the Himalayas. A recent study suggests that the average resident of Delhi loses up to 12 years of life to air pollution. According to official figures, in 2022 Delhi\u2019s air was considered \u201cgood\u201d or \u201csatisfactory\u201d on only 68 days. The average concentration of particularly harmful PM 2.5 particles\u2014which can enter the bloodstream and cause heart disease and respiratory problems\u2014was 98 micrograms per cubic metre. That is nearly 20 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organisation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As sources of air pollution are often far from the worst-affected places, it can only be significantly mitigated by different authorities acting in concert. Yet partisan rivalry often gets in the way\u2014as is illustrated by the latest row between Delhi\u2019s government, which is run by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and the central government of Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The argument pits Delhi\u2019s environment ministry against the city\u2019s pollution control committee, which is headed by a bureaucrat on secondment from the national home ministry. In late October the capital\u2019s environment minister claimed this official had unjustifiably withheld funding from a years-long study to measure the source of pollutants in Delhi\u2019s air. The pollution control committee claimed to have identified methodological flaws in the study which, it said, were designed to absolve the aap government of blame for the problem. The city administration, in turn, claimed the scuppering of the study was part of a pattern of government officials loyal to the BJP deliberately undermining the AAP\u2019s work. Whoever is right, the study is unlikely to be resumed\u2014a serious setback for pollution mitigation in the world\u2019s filthiest city."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The row is part of a broader fight between the AAP and centre over control of Delhi\u2019s entire bureaucracy. In August the central government passed a law in effect awarding control to itself. This superseded a Supreme Court verdict on the issue in the AAP\u2019s favour. A constitutional challenge by the AAP government is pending."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The row is threatening a rare hopeful anti-pollution effort. A regional anti-pollution body, encompassing Delhi, its neighbouring states and several central-government ministries, was recently launched to co-ordinate smog mitigation policies. The fact that the AAP also governs Punjab, where much of the stubble-burning happens, made that seem all the more promising. Yet the body will not achieve much so long as the central and Delhi governments prize partisan advantage over making Delhi\u2019s air safe to breathe. \u25a0"}], "id": 18}
