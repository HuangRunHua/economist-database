They have titles such as \u201cMount!\u201d and \u201cScore!\u201d and \u201cThe Man Who Made Husbands Jealous\u201d and are not easily mistaken for the collected works of Jane Austen. Their cast lists feature characters such as Rupert Campbell-Black (\u201cnirvana for most women\u201d), Bethany (a \u201cnymphomaniac\u201d) and Cadbury (a Labrador). Her novels contain far too many appearances of the word \u201cwet\u201d and a frankly distressing number of \u201cthrusts\u201d. They are reprehensible in almost every way. They are, in other words, great fun. And they also say something about how Britain has changed during Ms Cooper\u2019s long career. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The release of her latest novel, on November 9th, will be a peculiar publishing event. Everything from its nudging title (\u201cTackle!\u201d) to its cover (more tackle\u2014perhaps even tackle!\u2014in white shorts) suggests that this is the sort of book that literary London will sneer at. In fact, literary London almost certainly will not. Ms Cooper has written 18 novels and sold over 11m copies in Britain alone. She has built up not so much customers as a congregation, less readers than religious believers. Her followers range from the prime minister, Rishi Sunak (\u201cYou need to have escapism\u201d), to Cambridge dons (she is, one wrote, \u201cprecise, insightful, witty\u201d). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such public displays of affection surprise many who haven\u2019t read Ms Cooper\u2019s novels, and can particularly surprise the young. Ms Cooper\u2019s style is not what you would call \u201cwoke\u201d\u2014and it is certainly not feminist. Feminists do appear in her pages: they can usually be spotted by their hairy legs and their fondness for the New Statesman. In one Cooper novel, a boy asks his father who Florence Nightingale was. The father answers briskly: \u201cA lesbian.\u201d But then if Ms Cooper is out of touch that is hardly surprising. She is 86 and, like most who live so long, is anachronism incarnate\u2014a living reminder that social and sexual changes which appear prehistoric to younger minds were in fact pretty recent. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was only in 1975, the year in which her first novel, \u201cEmily\u201d, was published, that British women finally gained the right to open bank accounts without a male signatory. When \u201cRiders\u201d, the first of her novels set in the fictional county of \u201cRutshire\u201d, was published ten years later, Debrett\u2019s guide to \u201cEtiquette and Modern Manners\u201d could still be read earnestly rather than ironically. Its 1981 edition included advice on everything from how to address a marchioness (\u201cLady\u201d) to how to deal with a butler (let him buttle). It instructed on how to handle asparagus (demurely), corn on the cob (so messy it is best saved for those whose love you are sure of) and even \u201cSexual Relationships\u201d (see corn on the cob). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Openly admitting to reading \u201cJilly\u201d also surprises some people because it seems akin to openly admitting to an enthusiasm for porn. It is not entirely unreasonable to assume that her novels are all about sex. Her books were among a group of novels that led to the introduction of the term \u201cbonkbuster\u201d into the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002. There are lashings of sex in them\u2014at times there are even lashes. But the idea that they are pornographic is simply wrong, says Dr Ian Patterson, a fellow in English at Cambridge University, since in a Cooper novel sex is \u201cjust to do with fun\u201d and not there \u201cto titillate\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In fact the real pornography here is social, not sexual. Her books are filled with sweeping lawns, puce-faced colonels and above all, handsome upper-middle-class Englishmen. Her hero, Rupert Campbell-Black\u2014the hyphen gets heavy use in her stories\u2014is said to be partly based on Andrew Parker Bowles, the current queen\u2019s first husband. Her books linger lovingly over cads as they drink, smoke, swear and fondle fat Labradors and slender women in stone-flagged Cotswold kitchens. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is not all light; there are villains in Rutshire. They are called \u201csocialists\u201d and can be recognised because they wear sandals, drink your champagne and complain about things. But true darkness rarely breaks into Ms Cooper\u2019s writing. Evelyn Waugh once said of P.G. Wodehouse, a comic novelist, that his was a world in which there \u201chas been no Fall\u201d\u2014no evil had broken into his Eden. And, despite the sex and the smut, so it is with Ms Cooper\u2019s books. Her novels have \u201ca relentless faith in human good nature, of a quite old-fashioned sort\u201d, says Dr Patterson. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And when things do go wrong, her characters don\u2019t talk about it. Because perhaps the most archaic thing of all about her novels is that the good never complain. One of the most striking entries in that updated Debrett\u2019s edition appears in the section on \u201cRoyal, Diplomatic and Formal Occasions\u201d. Beneath the advice on what to wear (hats) and how to behave (toadyingly) comes the heading \u201cChoking\u201d (on food, that is). \u201cIf it happens it happens,\u201d Debrett\u2019s advises, but you should \u201cdo it as discreetly as possible\u201d. Ms Cooper comes from this school of stoicism. When she was involved in a terrible train crash in 1999, she simply said: \u201cI know how lucky I am.\u201d She has expressed bafflement at modern men who have beards and \u201ccry all the time\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are plots in her books\u2014stuff about football and horse-jumping. There are flaws, too. The recent novels in particular are more sprawling and less sharp. But that barely matters. Ms Cooper has created not merely stories but a world. Like Dickens\u2019s London or the Bront\u00ebs\u2019 Yorkshire or Austen\u2019s \u201c\u2014shire\u201d, \u201cRutshire\u201d is a place you know the moment you open the page, where people have clipped accents, rambling houses and, most important, fun. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
