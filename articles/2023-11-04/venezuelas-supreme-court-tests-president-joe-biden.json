On October 17th the autocratic regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro met in Barbados with representatives of the opposition to agree on how free and fair future elections should be held. The following day, the United States government lifted most of the draconian sanctions it had imposed since 2019 on Venezuela\u2019s oil, mining and finance sectors. Five political prisoners were then set free. On October 22nd, opposition primaries went ahead. Turnout was high, with the organisers saying more than 2m people voted. A thunderous 92% of those who participated backed Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, one of Mr Maduro\u2019s most determined critics (pictured)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Machado, a former congresswoman and an advocate of privatisation, has already been banned from political office by Mr Maduro\u2019s regime. But for a few giddy hours during and after the primary election, there was a flurry of optimism that perhaps a change was in the air. \u201cAll we Venezuelans want to do is vote,\u201d said Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez, a 74-year-old, as he cheerfully queued to cast his ballot at a polling station in Caracas, the capital. Some dared think that Mr Maduro\u2019s government might finally have been persuaded that the prize of a lifting of American sanctions was a fair exchange for allowing a real presidential election\u2014one in which it might even be defeated\u2014to take place next year.

Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, president of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly\u2014a body itself born out of a rigged vote in 2020\u2014declared that the opposition-run primary was \u201ca farce and a scam\u201d. He insinuated that the opposition stole the identities of 2m Venezuelans. His allegations were followed up by actual legal threats, delivered by the regime\u2019s attorney-general, Tarek William Saab, who announced that he was investigating those who had organised the primary vote. On October 30th the country\u2019s Supreme Court, yet another arm of Mr Maduro\u2019s government, declared that the result of the election was formally annulled.

They\u2019ve broken the deal\u201d, said Marco Rubio, the Republican senator for Florida, to Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, during a committee hearing at the Senate on October 31st. Mr Blinken insisted that the Venezuelan government would not get \u201ca free pass\u201d and that sanctions could be reimposed \u201cif the regime has, in fact, violated the agreement that it reached\u201d. Mr Blinken has previously stated that the regime has until the end of November to set a timeline \u201cfor the expedited reinstatement of all candidates\u201d, and to release several American prisoners from Venezuela."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Full reimposition of sanctions seems unlikely. The United States \u201chas several reasons to be careful,\u201d says Mariano de Alba, from the Crisis Group, a think-tank in Brussels. In September 50,000 Venezuelan migrants crossed the Mexican border to the United States, outnumbering Mexicans for the first time. Along with ensuring its own access to Venezuelan oil at a time of global supply concerns, Mr Biden\u2019s government is likely to want to stop that migration at its source by leaning on the regime. Meanwhile Mr Maduro\u2019s government will be reluctant to cut itself from the boom that a sanction-free economy could offer in an election year, while retaining the option to cheat if necessary. The end of this Venezuelan tragedy does not seem near. \u25a0"}], "id": 38}
