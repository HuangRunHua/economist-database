Immigration has long been seen as the solution to both problems in the country\u2019s century-and-a-half of existence. Canadians, who tend to think of themselves as pro-migrant, have broadly agreed that bringing in immigrants would improve the country\u2019s economic growth and help fund the country\u2019s generous social programmes as its population ages. Similarly, by making the country more diverse, migrants boost its culture, too. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That consensus is now starting to fray. For the first time in decades, the number of Canadians who want to take in fewer immigrants is increasing: it jumped from 34% in March to 53% in September, according to one poll. In another survey 44% of those asked either strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement \u201cthere is too much immigration to Canada,\u201d compared with 27% last year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What has caused this? Partly it comes down to the fact that a post-pandemic backlog in migration has turned into a deluge. For the year ending July 1st 2023, more than 1m newcomers arrived in Canada, edging the population over 40m. That was the highest annual population-growth rate, at 2.9%, since 1957. Statistics Canada, the usually sober statistical agency, announced it was \u201ccause for celebration\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not all Canadians are putting out the bunting, though. A lack of affordable housing in the country, combined with a public health-care system that is stretched by a shortage of family doctors, has led some to become wary of newcomers.

Indeed, many Canadians still say migrants are a good thing for the economy, even as they want fewer of them.

It was a concession, albeit a small one. \u25a0"}], "id": 39}
