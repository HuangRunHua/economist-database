In a sun-dappled bamboo grove, a group of student painters invite the two philosophers to be their models. As the young people paint, Marx and Confucius chat. They are impressed with China\u2019s high-speed trains, among other things. When the portraits are revealed, the thinkers are surprised. Marx is depicted in a Tang-dynasty robe; Confucius is portrayed in a Western suit and tie. But both are delighted. \u201cI\u2019ve been in China for more than a hundred years,\u201d says Marx (in Mandarin). \u201cActually, I have been Chinese for a long time.\u201d Confucius chuckles, stroking his beard. Long hair looks a bit strange with the suit, he says, but it make sense to keep changing."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The scene is from \u201cWhen Marx Met Confucius\u201d, a television series created by the propaganda department in Hunan province and released in October. It is not popular. On Douban, a film website, it has received only 100 or so reviews, most of them negative (eg, \u201cmakes me sick\u201d). But for those who can stomach it, the show is a good way to understand Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, the latest branch of the Chinese leader\u2019s philosophy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other parts of Mr Xi\u2019s thinking emphasise tighter Communist Party control over such things as diplomacy, defence and the economy. Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, announced in October, attempts to fuse pride in Chinese tradition with loyalty to the party. Its most important tenet is the \u201ctwo combines\u201d, party-speak for a decades-long process to make Marxism more Chinese. The first combine refers to early efforts to adapt Marxism to China\u2019s \u201cspecific reality\u201d. Such ideological flexibility allowed Deng Xiaoping, China\u2019s former leader, to pursue economic reforms in the 1980s. The second combine is Mr Xi\u2019s idea: to sinicise Marxism by melding it with traditional Chinese culture."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The effort represents the culmination of a radical turnaround for the party, which once considered tradition its enemy. During the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, Mao Zedong\u2019s Red Guards destroyed Confucian temples, burnt Confucian texts and desecrated the sage\u2019s tomb. Young people denounced their elders, contradicting Confucianism\u2019s emphasis on filial piety. But after Mao\u2019s death in 1976 the party warmed to Confucius, or at least to a simplified version of his teachings that emphasises deference to authority. Deng allowed public celebrations of the philosopher\u2019s birthday. Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, Deng\u2019s successors, appropriated Confucian ideas. In the early 2000s Chinese scholars debated whether Confucianism might even replace Marxism as China\u2019s guiding ideology."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Xi is putting an end to that debate. Marxism is the \u201csoul\u201d and Confucianism the \u201croot\u201d of Chinese culture, he says. Neither ideology can be abandoned. Instead, they must be merged."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWhen Marx Met Confucius\u201d guides viewers through this new thinking. For much of the five episodes, the philosophers sit on a stage in front of students and a rotating cast of scholars and party officials. A young woman wearing hanfu, traditional robes, plucks a guzheng, or ancient zither, in the background. The philosophers converse with holograms of figures such as Vladimir Lenin and Mao, who explain how their thinking is compatible. The programme\u2019s hosts then explain how it all fits into Xi Jinping Thought."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The show glosses over big differences between Confucius, who believed hierarchies were necessary to maintain social order, and Marx, who called for a proletarian revolution. \u201cYou were trying to maintain stability and I was seeking the liberation of all mankind,\u201d says Marx. \u201cBut aren\u2019t we both seeking the greatest good for all humans?\u201d When Marx mentions his vision of a classless society, Confucius says he has a comparable concept called datong (great unity). \u201cSo we have many similarities!\u201d says Confucius. The students applaud."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Cultural Revolution is mentioned\u2014once. It did \u201cgreat damage\u201d, says a host. But Mao doesn\u2019t get the blame. At one point his spirit appears, assuring Marx and Confucius that he was a faithful communist and defender of traditional Chinese culture. Confucius nods approvingly."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The show spends more time bashing the West. A host blames foreign bullying of China in the 19th century for a \u201clong-term cultural inferiority complex\u201d (exacerbated by Chinese intellectuals, who at the time claimed China\u2019s traditions made it weak). The early reform era of the 1980s is remembered as a dangerous period of \u201chistorical nihilism\u201d, when Western ideas misled Chinese people into criticising their society and government. \u201cCan a country become strong if its economy develops but its spirit is lost?\u201d asks the host, quoting Mr Xi. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "No is the implicit answer. A good thing, then, that Mr Xi is restoring China\u2019s confidence, the show claims. Not only that, he and the party are pursuing the common good worldwide, in contrast to dastardly Western countries. America exports cluster bombs, while Japan dumps nuclear wastewater into the ocean, says a host. China, a \u201cresponsible great power\u201d, would never do such things, he adds. Marx is impressed. He congratulates China for revitalising socialism and fulfilling his vision."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWhen Marx Met Confucius\u201d is easy to ridicule, but parts of its message are worrying. In the last episode, a student asks Confucius for advice on Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims. \u201cWe truly have a traditional culture of peace, but some Western countries only believe in the law of the jungle,\u201d says the student. \u201cIf they bully us or obstruct our national unification, should we still speak to them of peace?\u201d Confucius furrows his brow. Goodness should be met with goodness, but hatred should be met with justice, he says. A host jumps in. China seeks peace, but if its dignity and interests are hurt, it will use military force to pursue national unification, he says. Images of fighter jets and warships fill the screen. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 20}
