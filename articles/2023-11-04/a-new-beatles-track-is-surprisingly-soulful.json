Rumours swirled of a possible reunion\u2014until December 8th 1980, when John Lennon was assassinated in New York. Since then, the Beatles\u2019 archive has yielded a few posthumous gifts. In 1995 \u201cFree as a Bird\u201d, based on one of Lennon\u2019s last demos, was released; another, \u201cReal Love\u201d, came the next year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On November 2nd \u201cNow and Then\u201d, touted as the last new Beatles song, hits the airwaves and the internet. Like its 1990s predecessors, it derives from a demo long judged unmixable. Sir Paul McCartney hinted in June that a \u201ckind of scary\u201d AI would help produce a \u201cfinal Beatles record\u201d, seeding fears of some deep-faked pastiche. In reality far more basic software allowed Lennon\u2019s voice as recorded to sing on this new track, over accompaniment by Sir Paul and Sir Ringo Starr. (Guitar from George Harrison, who died in 2001, is also mixed in.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The release of this audio archaeology comes soon after AI allowed researchers to discern a single Greek word (\u201cpurple\u201d) from a carbonised scroll excavated at Herculaneum.

But even if it would be just a middling Beatles song\u2014if indeed it should be called that, and not the last work of Lennon\u2019s fruitful solo career\u2014its vitality is evidence of the Beatles\u2019 enduring appeal.
