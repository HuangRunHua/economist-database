And when the original was terrible, there is even more reason to dread the next episode. So it is with \u201cTariff Man Part Two\u201d. In the White House, Donald Trump put more new tariffs on American imports than any president in nearly a century. His philosophy was simple: \u201cI am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump\u2019s protectionism made America poorer, did little to help exporters and annoyed its friends. If he wins the Republican presidential nomination (a likely outcome) and goes on to win the election (too close to call), he has vowed to ramp up things. He is mulling an across-the-board levy of perhaps 10% on all products entering America. In one fell swoop, his plans would more than triple the average American tariff. The direct costs would be bad enough, with the tariffs functioning as a tax on consumers and hurting most producers. Yet they would also tear at America\u2019s ties with its allies and threaten to wreck the global trade system."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To get a sense of the impact, look back. On January 23rd 2018, a year after Mr Trump was sworn in, he got started with tariffs, hitting washing machines and solar panels. A couple of months later he went after aluminium and steel. A few months after that, it was Chinese goods. By 2021 American duties were worth 3% of the country\u2019s total import value, double the level when Mr Trump took office. Tariffs on Chinese imports rose from 3% to 19%, calculates Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231104_FNC863.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump\u2019s first aim was to slim the trade deficit.

Many allies retaliated, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The consequences were dismal. Industries that were protected by tariffs reaped benefits, enjoying greater market share and fatter profits. Most others suffered. America\u2019s International Trade Commission (usitc), a bipartisan agency, found that industries downstream from tariff-coddled producers faced higher input prices and lower profitability. The Peterson Institute estimated that steel users in effect paid an extra $650,000 per job created in the steel industry. Studies have calculated that almost all the costs have been borne by Americans, rather than foreign producers. The usitc found a near one-to-one increase in the price of American imports in the wake of tariffs on China.

On the campaign trail in 2019 Joe Biden criticised tariffs as a costly policy. In power he has rolled them back only a little. The array of levies on China remains intact. Whatever the merits of lifting tariffs, the White House appears fearful of blowback from looking soft on China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the same time, Mr Biden has concocted an enormous industrial policy, fuelled by more than $1trn in subsidies for electric vehicles, offshore wind, semiconductors and the like. It is a more thoughtful and deliberate approach than Mr Trump\u2019s, but it still looks likely to fail to bring about a manufacturing renaissance, is very expensive and, in lavishing subsidies on American factories, discriminates against other countries.

If Mr Trump wins the presidential election in 2024, the world may discover that the answer is: \u201cRather a lot.\u201d In August Mr Trump was interviewed on Fox Business, a television channel, by Larry Kudlow, his former economic adviser and a long-time media personality. Mr Trump put forward two ideas. First, all foreign firms selling to America would face a 10% levy. Second, if any country placed a high tariff on anything American, he would hit back with exactly the same tariff. \u201cCall it retribution,\u201d said Mr Trump. \u201cReciprocity,\u201d interjected Mr Kudlow, using the politer label."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The lineage of these ideas can be traced back to thinkers who crafted policy during Mr Trump\u2019s presidency, and who are working on new, more detailed plans. Robert Lighthizer, United States trade representative under Mr Trump, recently laid out his vision in a book, \u201cNo Trade is Free\u201d. One of his ideas is the universal tariff on all imports, to be used as a lever to bring America\u2019s trade flows into balance, so that the country no longer runs a big deficit. Mr Lighthizer would not limit the tariff to 10%. Rather, he writes, America should impose the levy \u201cat a progressively higher rate year after year until we achieve balance\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Project 2025, a coalition of conservative groups, published a book earlier this year with blueprints for almost every facet of government during a second Trump administration. In the trade chapter Peter Navarro, another economic adviser to Mr Trump, bemoaned the fact that countries like China and India have higher levies on America\u2019s goods than America does on theirs, arguing that this has led to \u201csystematic exploitation of American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and workers\u201d. In principle, reciprocity could be achieved in two ways\u2014either by persuading other countries to lower tariffs or by America raising its own. Mr Navarro leaves no doubt as to his preference."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Action, reaction"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Mr Trump has his way, other countries will probably respond by slapping their own tariffs on America. The spread of universal tariffs would be akin to a giant tax on cross-border transactions, making international commerce less attractive. Meanwhile, Mr Trump\u2019s hopes of shrinking the trade deficit would run headlong into the economic forces that actually determine the balance of exchanges between countries. In America\u2019s case the crucial factor is the country\u2019s low saving rate, which is almost certain to continue as a result of persistently high consumer spending and widening government deficits. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump has pointed to one ostensible virtue of his tariffs: they generate income. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group, estimates that a 10% tariff may bring in up to $2.5trn in extra revenue during its first decade of implementation, which could be used to reduce America\u2019s budget deficit. But this money could also be brought in by other methods. Raising tariffs simply means picking them as a tax over others such as, say, a higher income or inheritance tax."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Every tax has pros (eg, generating public revenue or discouraging bad behaviour) and cons (eg, hurting growth or imposing costs on individuals). The cons of tariffs are big. Ahmad Lashkaripour of Indiana University estimates that a global tariff war would shrink American gdp by about 1%. Most countries would suffer falls closer to 3%. The drag on smaller, trade-reliant economies would be greater still. Tariffs are also regressive since they hurt those on lower incomes twice. They tax more of their spending, by raising the price of consumer goods, and more of their earnings, since many work in industries, such as construction, that face higher material costs. If the bulk of the tariff bill is passed on to American consumers, as occurred with the first round of Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs, a 10% duty would cost each American household about $2,000 per year."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231104_FNC237.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The toll from universal tariffs would go beyond their economic impact. International commerce, and the system that enables it, built after the second world war, allows countries to challenge each other\u2019s policies at the World Trade Organisation (wto). But the wto\u2019s role in dispute settlement has been disabled since 2019, when the Trump administration blocked appointments to its appellate body, preventing the institution from making binding rulings. The result is that countries which object to Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs would lack a suitable way to confront them. \u201cThe system would fall apart in a much greater way than it did even during his first term,\u201d says Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Biden has not been a model free-trader. His industrial policy is built on lavish subsidies that, by incentivising investment in America, are unfair to other countries. Yet even if somewhat hamfisted, he has worked to cobble together supply chains and trade networks that bring America and its allies closer together. This is part of an attempt, still in its infancy, to lessen dependence on China. Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs would reverse Mr Biden\u2019s progress. It would no longer be America and (occasionally reluctant) friends versus China\u2014it would be America versus the world. \u201cTrump would view it as a badge of honour if other countries were upset.

The constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce; the president can intervene only by using special justifications. Mr Trump previously drew on two statutes: section 232 of trade law allows the president to restrict imports in order to protect national security (the dubious basis for tariffs on steel and aluminium); section 301 allows a president to impose tariffs against a country with discriminatory trade behaviour (the more reasonable basis for actions against China). But both require time-consuming investigations, which would cut against the desire of Mr Trump and his advisers for rapid executive actions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another option would be to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Mr Trump used in 2020 to order the removal of TikTok and WeChat, Chinese social-media goliaths, from American app stores. In this scenario Mr Trump would declare a national emergency and then announce a universal tariff as the response. \u201cIt is less clear exactly what national emergency would be declared,\u201d says Jennifer Hillman, a former general counsel with the us trade representative. \u201cPerhaps that the trade deficit is threatening American competitiveness? Or that the size of the trade deficit is unsustainable?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Few economists would endorse such thinking. Far from being a weakness, appetite for imports comes from strength. America has run deficits for the past half-century, a period of economic dominance. More crucially, legal experts would also take a dim view. \u201cTrump would be bending the law in a direction that it was never intended to apply,\u201d says Alan Wolff, a veteran of trade law. \u201cThere would be court challenges, and they might well be successful.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Reciprocal tariffs might seem tidier, but any attempt to impose them would get messy. Mr Navarro loves to point out that American tariffs on cars are just 2.5%, whereas the European Union charges 10%. What he omits is that America has long placed a 25% tariff on imports of pick-up trucks, not to mention hefty duties on some imports of lumber and foods. A line-by-line look at tariffs would turn up scores of examples where American levies are higher than those of other countries. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indeed, a guiding principle of the wto is that countries can negotiate across different product categories to set tariffs that protect politically sensitive sectors, so long as they keep tariffs down overall.

Its chapter on trade is split in two: Mr Navarro\u2019s plea for tariffs is set against a free-trade argument by Kent Lassman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think-tank. Mr Lassman lays out what he dubs a \u201cconservative vision for trade\u201d, calling for tariff cuts to reduce consumer prices, as well as more ambitious trade deals."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump\u2019s domestic opponents would receive support from abroad.
