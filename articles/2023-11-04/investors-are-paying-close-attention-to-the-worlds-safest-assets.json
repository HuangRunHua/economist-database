That has been the golden rule of Treasury issuance for 40 years. America\u2019s fiscal branch once funded itself with \u201ctactical\u201d bond sales. Officials would survey market participants and issue debt in response. But this process proved highly disruptive to financial activity. So in 1982 they adopted a new approach: a regular schedule of issuance would be followed, communicated long in advance. Treasury officials now think that, by reducing overall borrowing costs, this strategy has saved taxpayers a fortune."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As a part of this regularly scheduled programme the Treasury has, for decades, released a \u201cquarterly refunding announcement\u201d in which it lays out its plans for the next three months. This is not generally a hotly anticipated event, being precisely the kind of wonkish release that seldom attracts wider interest. But on November 1st the announcement was pretty much all that Wall Street cared about. Ian Lyngen of bmo Capital Markets, an investment bank, declared this a \u201cunique moment in market history\u201d, because the refunding announcement was more important than the meeting of the Federal Reserve, which took place later the same day. \u201cAll that matters at this moment is supply.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Investors\u2019 interest has been piqued for several reasons. America\u2019s fiscal deficit is large. It will clock in at almost 6% of gdp for the fiscal year of 2022-23. It has been pushed upwards by high interest rates, which have increased the cost of servicing America\u2019s national debt. This has put pressure on bond markets. In August, at the last refunding announcement, the market appeared surprised by both the increase in total issuance and just how much of it was long-dated. In the weeks that followed several auctions \u201ctailed\u201d\u2014trader-speak for the auction resulting in debt being issued at a higher yield than expected.

Since August 1st the yield on t-bills, the name given to short-dated Treasuries which mature within a year, has not budged at all. Yields have spiked, however, for long-dated bonds that mature in ten or 30 years.

Planned issuance was increased, but will be concentrated at the short end. Exactly the same value of 20-year Treasuries will be issued in the three months from November as in the three that preceded it, but almost 20% more two-year Treasuries will be sold. Currently, short-dated t-bill issuance is more than one-fifth of total debt issuance. Although that is slightly above historical levels, the issuance committee indicated that it might be willing to go higher still. As noted in the minutes of their meeting, committee members \u201csupported meaningful deviation\u201d from the range. Markets embraced all of this news.
