According to a poll on March 11th for Profil, a weekly, the FP\u00d6 is now comfortably the strongest party in the Alpine republic, with 31% of the vote, followed by the Socialists (SP\u00d6) at 25% and the centre-right Austrian People\u2019s Party (\u00d6VP) with 22%. If Austrians could vote directly for their chancellor, the poll showed it would be a tie between Mr Kickl and the \u00d6VP\u2019s Karl Nehammer, the incumbent. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The result of recent state elections in Lower Austria, formerly a fief of the \u00d6VP, confirms the renaissance of the FP\u00d6. The \u00d6VP lost its absolute majority, scoring 40% of the vote, its worst result in decades, while the FP\u00d6\u2019s share jumped from 15% to 24%. On March 5th voters in Carinthia, an FP\u00d6 stronghold and Mr Kickl\u2019s home state, saw the party take its vote share from 23% in 2018 to 25%; the incumbent state governor\u2019s SP\u00d6 lost nine percentage points. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The reason for the FP\u00d6\u2019s comeback is the poor performance of the leaders of both of the big mainstream parties, the \u00d6VP and the SP\u00d6, and the confluence of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis. Austrian tourism was especially hard hit by the chaotic covid policies of successive \u00d6VP-led governments. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Kickl is almost unknown outside Austria, even though, as a hardline ideologue, he was the power behind the throne of both J\u00f6rg Haider and Heinz-Christian Strache, two of the FP\u00d6\u2019s long-term leaders. He concocted many of the party\u2019s nastiest slogans, such as \u201cMore courage for our Viennese blood\u201d and \u201cHome, not Islam\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He rose to the top after a scandal rocked Austria in May 2019 that seemed to spell the final destruction of the FP\u00d6. A secretly filmed video showed Mr Strache, then the FP\u00d6\u2019s boss, at a villa in the Spanish island of Ibiza where he appeared to promise government contracts in exchange for party donations to a woman who claimed to be the niece of an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president. Mr Strache was out, both as boss of the FP\u00d6 and as Austria\u2019s vice-chancellor, within 24 hours."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sebastian Kurz, who was then the chancellor, dissolved the coalition government of his \u00d6VP and the FP\u00d6, and called an early general election. Support for the FP\u00d6 thereupon plunged by a third, from 25% to just 16%. Mr Kurz picked the Greens as his new coalition partners rather than the FP\u00d6."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At municipal elections in Vienna the following year, the FP\u00d6\u2019s vote slumped even more, from 30% to a dismal 7%. By then led by Norbert Hofer, the party was riven by bitter battles between a more conciliatory faction close to Mr Hofer and acolytes of the openly xenophobic Mr Kickl. In June 2021 Mr Hofer threw in the towel. Mr Kickl became the party\u2019s undisputed boss."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe international fixation on J\u00f6rg Haider meant that once he was gone, the alarm about his party faded,\u201d says Andreas Peham, an expert on the far right at the Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance. (Haider died in a car crash in 2008 at the age of 58.) But the party\u2019s views have since become still more radical. Mr Kickl, for instance, has sounded ambivalent about his party\u2019s attitude to the identitarian movement, Europe\u2019s answer to America\u2019s alt-right, with its anti-Muslim, anti-media and anti-migrant messages."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As a result of this radical lurch, the other bigger parties say they will refuse to consider any type of alliance with the FP\u00d6. So even if it were to be the strongest party at next year\u2019s general election, it would get back into government only if the other party leaders changed their mind. They used to ostracise Haider and his FP\u00d6. But in 2000 Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, the chancellor and \u00d6VP leader, broke that taboo. In fact, the FP\u00d6 has been part of a coalition government four times in the past 40 years. \u25a0"}]}
