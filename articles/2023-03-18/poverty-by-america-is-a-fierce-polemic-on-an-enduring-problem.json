By Matthew Desmond. Crown; 304 pages; $28. Allen Lane; \u00a325"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the richest country in history, poverty in America remains jarringly widespread. Taking government assistance into account, one in eight American adults was classified as poor on the eve of the pandemic: a smaller share than in previous decades but still a big slice of the population. Every now and then, a polemic on the subject cuts through the routine news and statistics to induce shame, or even, in rare cases, spur change. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1962 the social activist Michael Harrington published \u201cThe Other America\u201d, an expos\u00e9 of the invisible poor who\u2014on his reading of government income figures\u2014included as many as half of senior citizens. The book was credited with helping to inspire the national \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d that President Lyndon Johnson launched a couple of years later. In \u201cThe Colour of Law\u201d (2017), Richard Rothstein chronicled the prejudiced governmental programmes that denied mortgages to African-Americans and contributed to urban segregation, which still blights opportunity today. The book popularised the term \u201credlining\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Published in 2016, Matthew Desmond\u2019s study of housing insecurity in America, \u201cEvicted\u201d, was another book with a big impact. It won a Pulitzer prize for its author, a sociologist at Princeton University, and became one of the most influential works of social science of its decade. His follow-up, \u201cPoverty, By America\u201d, is about the persistent problem of poverty and its causes. Though he writes movingly about the psychological scars of poverty, this book lacks the anthropological research and in-depth analysis that distinguished its predecessor. In its own way, though, it is useful: it shows the shortcomings of an approach that dismisses incremental gains and prioritises piety over real-world policies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Poverty, Mr Desmond argues, is not complicated but simple. There is so much of it in America, he writes, because many Americans like it that way. Wittingly or otherwise, the country\u2019s citizens conspire to exploit the poor. They crush unions, enjoy goods and services produced on paltry wages, trap their compatriots in slums and slant the tax code for the benefit of the better-off. Absolution for this moral sickness, the author says, should come through a new project of \u201cpoverty abolitionism\u201d. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Hope over experience"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many fine books on American poverty criticise capitalism and go in for intermittent moralising. It is indeed a moral failing that America continues to have a high rate of child poverty. But in this book, moral certainty and righteousness are the main substance of the argument."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Desmond actively disparages nuance. \u201cHungry people want bread,\u201d he notes. In response, \u201cthe rich convene a panel of experts. Complexity is the refuge of the powerful.\u201d His policy analysis, when he gets to it, is cursory, somewhat contradictory and largely unconcerned with alternative explanations. He dismisses the prominent thesis that urban poverty is a result of deindustrialisation in a single short paragraph (which mostly gripes about the ugliness of that term)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The trillions spent on anti-poverty initiatives have achieved little, Mr Desmond argues fatalistically. \u201cThere is no real improvement here,\u201d he writes, \u201cjust a long stasis.\u201d Programmes that top up the wages of low-income workers\u2014so providing money for food and other essentials\u2014wind up subsidising exploitative firms and slumlords, he alleges. In fact, analysis by the sort of expert panel he dislikes, including one at Columbia University, shows that this kind of welfare spending has kept millions out of poverty (currently defined, for a family of four, as living on just under $30,000 a year). Poor children caught by such safety-net schemes experience gains later in life, too. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Despite his critique of anti-poverty spending, one of Mr Desmond\u2019s main solutions is to boost it considerably, by ensuring everyone is paid enough to stay above the poverty line. In the year 2020, he calculates, that would have taken roughly $177bn on top of existing welfare spending (he does not specify whether that cost would recur). He denounces those who might query this endeavour: \u201cHow can we afford it? What a sinful question. What a selfish, dishonest question, one asked as if the answer wasn\u2019t staring us in the face.\u201d Possible unintended consequences, such as the risk of disincentivising work, are also unworthy of serious discussion."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cEvicted\u201d was gripping in part because it drew on years of research in the slums of Milwaukee. \u201cPoverty, By America\u201d does not build on case studies in the same way (though some of the earlier material is recycled). Mr Desmond remains a talented writer, and his prose can be crisp, elegant and elegiac. \u201cPoverty is often material scarcity piled on chronic pain piled on depression piled on addiction,\u201d he explains. \u201cPoverty isn\u2019t a line. It\u2019s a tight knot of social maladies.\u201d In other passages, though, the style is botched. His peroration\u2014\u201cWe don\u2019t need to outsmart this problem. We need to out-hate it\u201d\u2014is less stirring than it seems meant to be. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "The bad old days"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The book is strongest when it revisits the problem of rental housing, showing how those with little choice but to live in dreadful flats are obliged to pay scandalous rents\u2014as well as the egregious way the federal government subsidises home ownership for the already wealthy. Mr Desmond is right to say that the poor are harmed by America\u2019s segregation into islands of affluence and pits of concentrated poverty. But technocratic solutions for this interest him less than self-flagellation. \u201cMaybe above a certain income level, we are all segregationists,\u201d he muses."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pessimism addles judgment. The assertions that \u201cthe United States now offers some of the lowest wages in the industrialised world\u201d, and that America has created a \u201cwelfare state that heavily favours the upper class\u201d, are both, at best, deeply questionable readings of the data. Mr Desmond\u2019s reverence for the American trente glorieuses from the late 1940s to the late 1970s\u2014his view that \u201cthings weren\u2019t always this bad\u201d, because, in the olden days, the unions were riding high\u2014is inconsistent with the dire poverty Harrington depicted in his book, and which set off Johnson\u2019s nationwide \u201cwar\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Desmond portrays himself as a warrior against the \u201cpropaganda of capitalism\u201d, which caricatures the poor as undeserving and denies that the capitalist system \u201cis inherently about workers trying to get as much, and owners trying to give as little, as possible\u201d. Yet the contest of ideas and interests need not be zero-sum. Many industrialised countries manage to have both vibrant market economies and low poverty rates because they redistribute a bit more, and a bit more intelligently. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The author wants readers to become \u201cpoverty abolitionists\u201d. That means, for instance, only buying beer or sweets that are made with unionised labour. Such recommendations may be worthy, but they are less practical than technocratic policies such as expanding tax credits for children. In 2021 a nationwide trial of that programme saw the child-poverty rate drop by almost half (it rose again when the trial ended). It was a heartening success on which Mr Desmond does not dwell.
