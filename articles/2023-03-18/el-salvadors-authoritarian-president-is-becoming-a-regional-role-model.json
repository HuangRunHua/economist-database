He inaugurated the \u201cterrorist-confinement prison\u201d on the plains near the San Vicente volcano in the centre of the country.

In 2020 he sent soldiers into the National Assembly to bully it into supporting his security budget. In 2021 El Salvador became the first country to make bitcoin legal tender. Mr Bukele\u2019s theatrics and his policies have paid political dividends. His approval rating has not dropped below 75% since he took office in 2019.

In 2015 El Salvador had the highest murder rate in the world, 106 per 100,000 people (see chart). Last year, according to the government\u2019s figures, this had dropped to 7.8. That rate puts El Salvador on a par with the United States. In next-door Honduras it is 36. The \u201cunprecedented reduction in crime\u201d has contributed to \u201crobust [economic] activity\u201d, the IMF noted recently. Tourism has recovered from the slump brought on by the pandemic: 2.5m tourists visited El Salvador in 2022, nearly the same number as in 2019. Lonely Planet, a guidebook publisher, lists the country as one of its top destinations for this year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Politicians in nearby countries are studying Mr Bukele\u2019s tactics. Zury R\u00edos, the front-runner in Guatemala\u2019s presidential election, scheduled for June, has called his security policy \u201ca model\u201d. Costa Rica\u2019s security minister has said the country should adopt it. Leaders outside El Salvador are experimenting with Mr Bukele\u2019s methods rather than adopting them in full. But there is popular pressure to go further. That could imperil democracy and human rights in Central America and beyond. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bukele, who comes across as Hollywood\u2019s idea of the hijacker of the president\u2019s plane rather than the president himself, seems keen to export his style of government. In January El Salvador announced that it would open an office in Haiti to advise its government how to deal with the gangs that control much of the country. Mr Bukele\u2019s associates have set up a political party in Guatemala with the same name and logo as his New Ideas party and have made an attempt, so far unsuccessful, to do the same in Costa Rica. If El Salvador\u2019s murder rate stays down, his influence will grow. \u201cIf this proves sustainable, a lot of people all over Latin America will be looking to Bukele as a model to follow,\u201d says Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice-president of Costa Rica who now leads IDEA, a think-tank based in Stockholm."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bukele\u2019s growing soft power abroad is based on a ruthless exercise of hard power at home. Two gangs, Barrio 18 and MS-13, have terrorised Salvadoreans for years. Their main business is extortion. When the violence they caused was at its height, GDP was 16% lower than it would otherwise have been by one estimate. In March last year, after a weekend during which the gangs killed 87 people, Mr Bukele introduced a \u201cstate of exception\u201d that allows police to arrest anyone without showing cause. Since then, he boasts, police have locked up 62,000 people, 2% of the adult population. This is the \u201clargest dragnet\u201d ever in Central America, a region given to harsh crackdowns on crime, according to the International Crisis Group, a think-tank based in Brussels."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The results have been dramatic. In Las Ca\u00f1as, a neighbourhood of Ilopango, a town east of San Salvador, rival gangs used to clash near the football pitch that marked the border between their territories. Anyone passing could be hurt, says \u00c1lex Mel\u00e9ndez, a 37-year-old resident. He used to leave his job refurbishing houses at 4pm to get home before dusk. Since the round-ups carried out under Mr Bukele\u2019s state of exception, Mr Mel\u00e9ndez has been able to stay out. His mother-in-law has opened a sweet shop. Youngsters play football late into the evening on the formerly contested pitch."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Salvadoreans are paying a high price for relative peace. El Faro, a digital newspaper, put it this way in a headline: \u201cNo gangs but no more democracy\u201d. Yessenia, who works with young people in a Catholic church in Delgado, close to the capital, says youths are no longer scared of gangs and have new opportunities. But now they are frightened of the army and police who patrol the community. \u201cThey are always harassed by the authorities,\u201d she says. Claudia Ortiz, an opposition lawmaker, says \u201cthere is a lot of collateral damage\u201d from Mr Bukele\u2019s offensive against crime. \u201cAnd there is no plan for exiting the emergency.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "His crackdown on crime is enabled by one on lawful institutions that might get in his way. After intimidating the legislature he won control of it in elections in 2021. Soon after he sacked the attorney-general and judges on the Supreme Court, replacing them with loyalists who renew monthly his state of exception. He has threatened to sue independent media (including El Faro). He uses trolls to insult critics on social media and to try to get their accounts shut down. In a ranking of democracies by the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company, El Salvador fell further last year than all but three countries (Burkina Faso, Haiti and Russia). It classifies El Salvador\u2019s government as a \u201chybrid regime\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Among the services rendered by the new Supreme Court is permission for Mr Bukele to run for re-election next year, despite a constitutional term limit. He need not commit fraud to win it and to secure again a parliamentary majority. Voters still blame the two main opposition parties, which alternated in power from the end of the civil war in 1992, for misgoverning the country until Mr Bukele came along. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "His governing project poses two dangers. The first is that it fails. Many Latin American governments, including past ones in El Salvador, have tried versions of Mr Bukele\u2019s mano dura (iron fist) policies. All have failed, says Ivan Briscoe of Crisis Group. Guatemala\u2019s Plan Escoba in 2004 used extrajudicial killings of gang members. The murder rate rose to record highs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bukele, like his predecessors, started out by trying to strike deals with gangs. He refused to extradite 14 bosses to the United States and quietly let some out of prison. The crackdown came after relations deteriorated and killings jumped. For now his policy of removing people from the streets, and raising security forces\u2019 pay so they don\u2019t team up with the criminals, is working, though the violence began dropping before Mr Bukele became president. The government\u2019s homicide numbers exclude some victims, such as gangsters who die in shoot-outs with police."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230318_AMP002.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The dip in violence is unlikely to last. People who are wrongly locked up may be forced to join existing gangs in the terrorist-confinement jail to protect themselves. And new criminal networks may form, as has happened in other Latin American prisons. Despite the recovery of tourism and the reduction in violence, El Salvador\u2019s economy is not yet growing fast enough to significantly reduce unemployment and poverty, which push young people towards gangs in the first place. \u201cEducation, the desire for status and so on has not changed,\u201d says Mr Briscoe. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second danger is that Mr Bukele succeeds, and that he becomes a role model in Central America and beyond. Central America\u2019s only full-fledged dictator is Nicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega, a 77-year-old leftist who overthrew a right-wing regime more than 40 years ago, then lost and regained power. Mr Bukele, a younger, cooler caudillo, is likely to have more appeal in a region that is disappointed with democracy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras) the democracies that formed in the 1990s after civil wars were mechanisms for sharing spoils between the political parties founded by the combatants. Poverty, violence and corruption have thwarted economic development and fostered crime. Since 2014 more than 2m people have emigrated from the area. Costa Rica, a more prosperous and stable democracy, suffers from political paralysis caused by the fragmentation of power among parties and the president\u2019s frequent use of his veto power. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Latin Americans are increasingly willing to sacrifice democracy for security and prosperity. AmericasBarometer, a survey, reports that more than half would give up the right to vote if that would get them decent incomes and basic services. In 2021 half of Salvadoreans, the highest level in Latin America, said that in difficult times the president should be able to shut down the parliament. That is a rise of 33 percentage points from 2018. In neighbouring Guatemala 38% would accept that deal. In Guatemala and Honduras small groups have recently held demonstrations to demand Bukele-style rule. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Leaders in the region are trying some of his tactics, but wary of becoming his clones. In an effort to reduce extortion, in December Honduras\u2019s left-leaning president, Xiomara Castro, declared a state of emergency that, like Mr Bukele\u2019s, allows the police to jail suspects without charge. But her government has jailed fewer people and exempted some municipalities. Rodrigo Chaves, Costa Rica\u2019s president, is under investigation by a parliamentary committee for allegations that he used trolls to harass journalists in the run-up to his election in 2022. Like Mr Bukele he fulminates against the opposition and the press, and rubbishes rather than seeking to reform institutions that he claims hold up progress. Yet Mr Chaves has ruled out adopting Mr Bukele\u2019s security model. He pointedly declares that he loves democracy and supports the separation of powers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The answer to democracy\u2019s failings is to \u201cto make democracy work better\u201d, says Mr Casas-Zamora. At the moment, to many Salvadoreans and citizens of nearby countries, Mr Bukele\u2019s authoritarianism seems more alluring. \u25a0"}], "id": 29}
