Yet on March 11th some 10,000 Beershevans felt angry enough to protest against the government\u2019s plans to weaken Israel\u2019s Supreme Court. \u201cThis is a Bibi-ist town,\u201d says Zipi Stolero, a retired civil servant who has lived there for 65 years. \u201cBut people are marching because they feel\u2026freedom is at risk.\u201d That the demonstrations have spread to Beersheva shows how widespread discontent with the government has become.

Under the reform, the Supreme Court\u2019s powers to overturn laws passed by the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, will be all but eliminated. New judges will be appointed by a commission stacked with people loyal to the coalition. The government insists this is necessary, arguing that the fiercely independent and activist court has seized powers on the basis of ill-defined laws, in what amounts to a \u201cjudicial dictatorship\u201d. Israelis taking to the streets are convinced that the legislation is intended to let the government pursue a nationalistic agenda that will pander to the religious parties.

Today it no longer faces such dangers. The risk is from the battle between Israelis. \u201cI\u2019ve been warning for years that our biggest threat is an internal one,\u201d says a former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, who led an unwieldy coalition of right-wingers, centrists, leftists and Islamists for 18 months until last November. \u201cThere are those who are trying very hard to divide us into two nations, Israelis and Jews,\u201d says Mr Bennett.

First, between the Jewish majority and a minority of Arab-Palestinians who remained within its borders. Second, within its Jewish population, between the predominantly secular majority, mostly of Ashkenazi (European) heritage, and a more religious minority. Over the decades neither gained an advantage. But the divisions have deepened. The current crisis is ostensibly over the democratic character of Israel\u2019s institutions. It is also a clash between two Israels: the poorer, more religious one, represented by Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition; and the largely secular, more middle-class one, which sees the Supreme Court as the guarantor of the country\u2019s liberal values.

The majority would get to preserve Israel\u2019s character as secular and fairly liberal. Now that covenant\u2014Israel\u2019s social contract\u2014is breaking."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is partly explained by the growth in both numbers and power of the Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox community. They currently represent 13% of Israel\u2019s population. Since their birth rate is nearly three times higher than secular Israelis\u2019, that percentage could double by 2050. Their representation in the Knesset has been rising fast. Their parties have formed alliances with Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud, a once-secular nationalist party, in the belief that the right has greater respect for Judaism. Both the ultra-Orthodox, who keep away from secular Israelis, and the right-wingers, who are part of mainstream society, chafe at what they claim is the control by a leftist minority of the courts, academia and the media. This has in turn fostered a sense that they have never really been in power, although since 1977 most governments have been formed by Likud in coalition with religious parties. Among the Haredim this belief has sown a growing resentment and distrust of the Supreme Court."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Keep to the paths of righteousness"}, {"role": "body", "text": " \u201cOur community has long been on a collision course with the Supreme Court, which doesn\u2019t reflect our values and rules on matters pertaining to our lives,\u201d says Eli Paley, the chair of the Haredi Institute for Public Affairs. \u201cWe\u2019re not the ones trying to shape Israeli society according to our values; the court is.\u201d Tension has been brewing for decades. In 1999 over quarter of a million Haredim demonstrated against a ruling by the Supreme Court that forced powerful local religious councils to integrate representatives of modern Reform Judaism.

If the tech industry has guaranteed Israel\u2019s prosperity, the army has maintained its security.
