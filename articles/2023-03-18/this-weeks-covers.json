SVB was just one of three American lenders to fail in the space of a week. So far this month, the market value of America\u2019s banks has plunged by $229bn\u2014or 17%. Share prices of banks in Europe and Japan have tumbled, too.

But the shattered coin suggested that we were predicting a broad collapse of America\u2019s banks. So we tried to strike an unhappy medium.

The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has led the country for 15 of the past 27 years, prides himself on making ruthless, often ugly, trade-offs that ultimately leave Israel stronger. This time, however, he has proposed judicial reforms that are tearing the country apart. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "We thought we could use photography to focus on popular dissent. However, photographs of demonstrations fail to get across the drama\u2014perhaps because one protest looks very much like another. We also considered portraying Israel as a shard of glass. It\u2019s powerful, but we ran into trouble with the metaphor. Maps are about borders, and when you talk about the map of Israel, you evoke the fight between Jews and Arabs over land. This is quite different from the fight we are writing about, which is between Israelis over the character of their democracy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much better to represent the rift between Israelis by their flag. Bibi is clearer here, too. An MIT-educated, secular pragmatist, he is Israel\u2019s most consequential politician of the past 25 years.

Alas, his brand is too toxic and he is too bent on protecting himself against charges of corruption. His time has passed.
