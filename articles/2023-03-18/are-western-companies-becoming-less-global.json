The latest strains on globalised commerce\u2014wrought by geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism\u2014raise tricky questions for the corporate giants of the West that have been among globalisation\u2019s biggest beneficiaries. Their initial responses sketch out the contours of the Western multinational of the 21st century. It is less reliant on China and more reliant on intangible assets such as software and patents. But overall, it is no less global."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Western firms started spreading out into the world in the 1600s, when Europe\u2019s colonial trading houses ventured (often violently) beyond the old continent in search of commercial opportunities. By the start of the 20th century the global stock of foreign direct investment (FDI), a rough proxy for the prevalence of multinational businesses, was hovering at 10% or so of world GDP. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then, around the time Russians took to glugging locally made Coke, the West\u2019s corporate globetrotters experienced their own carbonated high. Freer trade, lower shipping costs and better communications technology allowed them to become more truly global. They set up shop wherever they could find cheaper labour, lower taxes or new customers. In the early 2010s the worldwide stock of FDI reached the equivalent of 30% of global output. Western businesses accounted for 78% of the total. The average American multinational had a dozen foreign subsidiaries."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the past decade or so things started to change. American and European companies began to lose some of their foreign fizz. Banks battered by the global financial crisis of 2007-09 and the ensuing euro-zone debt rigmarole slimmed down their foreign businesses. And new competitors, especially from China, began to challenge Western firms. Four of the five biggest smartphone brands in India, for example, are now Chinese. Last year China overtook Germany as the world\u2019s second-largest car exporter, behind only Japan.

Western semiconductor companies, for example, derive around 30% of their sales from China.

Look across all industries, and China is responsible for less than one-eighth of Western firms\u2019 foreign revenues, according to Morgan Stanley, an investment bank\u2014a much smaller share than American and European sales across the Atlantic or to the rest of the emerging world (see chart 3). Only 8% of European companies\u2019 total revenues come from China. For their American counterparts, the figure is 4%.

Technological progress means that many firms\u2019 most productive assets are now not their physical plant and equipment but intangibles like computer programs and patents. This increases the returns on investment in talent, especially in places where an educated workforce commands lower wages than in the West. Technologies such as speedier broadband, video calls and cloud computing make this talent pool easier than ever to tap.

In 2021 American and European listed companies with $10bn-plus in revenue generated 43% of their sales abroad on average, compared with just 32% for those with sales below $1bn.
