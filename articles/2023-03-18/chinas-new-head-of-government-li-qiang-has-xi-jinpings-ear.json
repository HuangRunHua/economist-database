He has called private business his native province\u2019s \u201cgolden namecard\u201d. He has boasted of the entrepreneurial daring of his home town, and lashed out at officials for interfering with the market. He has scolded scholars for failing to criticise his work boldly enough. But he is also a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Xi Jinping, who has crushed dissent and sent shivers through the business world with his efforts to tighten the Communist Party\u2019s control over everything, not least the economy. Could Mr Li\u2019s appointment, rubber-stamped on March 11th by China\u2019s parliament, make a difference to the way China is run?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Xi\u2019s rule by fear, requiring officials to make endless protestations of loyalty, has made it harder than ever to divine the policy preferences of individual leaders and sense how they get along with each other. In the years leading up to his latest appointment, the 63-year-old Mr Li has hewed to the same script as his colleagues. At the annual parliamentary meeting, known as the National People\u2019s Congress, he heaped praise on Mr Xi, attributing China\u2019s \u201cmajor achievements\u201d amid a \u201csevere and complex international situation\u201d to his \u201cbeing at the helm and piloting the ship\u201d. Such phraseology recalls the personality cult that surrounded Mao Zedong."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But it is worth pondering what kind of leader Mr Li might be. His predecessor, Li Keqiang, who is 67, was not close to Mr Xi and was sidelined by him after taking over as prime minister in 2013. Previously, however, the job had offered much clout, especially over economic policy. Two questions now arise. Will Mr Xi give the younger Mr Li, whom he is likely to trust far more than Li Keqiang, any more freedom to set his own agenda? If so, how might he use it? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The two Lis have strikingly different backgrounds. The elder is an intellectual type, whose father was a mid-ranking official. He studied law and economics at the prestigious Peking University. The younger worked in a pumping station and a factory before studying agricultural machinery in his native province, Zhejiang. From early in his career, Li Keqiang appeared on track for a top job in the central leadership. Li Qiang, by contrast, might have remained little known outside Zhejiang had it not been for Mr Xi\u2019s arrival: in 2002 Mr Xi became the province\u2019s party chief. Mr Li was then the party boss of Wenzhou city, a centre of manufacturing in Zhejiang. In 2004 he was promoted, becoming Mr Xi\u2019s chief of staff. (He also continued his part-time studies at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, gaining an MBA in 2005.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last October, in a reshuffle of the ruling Politburo, Mr Xi surrounded himself with people who had worked with him during his career in the provinces. Mr Li\u2014by then the party leader of Shanghai\u2014became his number two, replacing Li Keqiang. It was a remarkable promotion. Unlike previous holders of that rank, he had no experience at the central level. Some observers had wondered whether his record in Shanghai, where he had overseen a two-month lockdown of the city in 2022 that was widely resented by residents, might have doomed his chances of rising further. But clearly he had impressed Mr Xi, who then was championing a tough approach to covid-19. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Li, however, is no colourless bureaucrat. He may have instincts that are more in tune than Mr Xi\u2019s with those of private firms. And he may, just possibly, be prepared to argue with his boss, even though he is likely to be unflinchingly loyal. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Shanghai many businesspeople liked Mr Li. He helped Tesla, an American electric-vehicle maker, set up a factory that was wholly owned by the company\u2014a rare concession to a foreign firm in China\u2019s highly protected automotive industry. He supported the use of imported covid vaccines when the central government was digging in its heels. It still has not approved their use, even though Western-made vaccines are more effective than China\u2019s. Whether policy will change now that Mr Li is prime minister will be interesting to watch. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to Reuters, a news agency, Mr Li was put in charge of the country\u2019s covid task-force after last year\u2019s Politburo shake-up. He introduced measures to loosen \u201czero-covid\u201d restrictions. While cases mounted and Mr Xi wavered, the news agency says, Mr Li \u201cresisted pressure from the president to slow the pace of reopening\u201d. Reuters was not able to establish how Mr Xi reacted. But in February China\u2019s leader declared a \u201cdecisive victory\u201d over covid."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Not your typical functionary"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the country\u2019s highly secretive political culture, such inside accounts are hard to confirm. But publicly available records of Mr Li\u2019s career in the provinces occasionally hint at a man who has views of his own. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One glimpse was offered in 2015 by Guangming Daily, a newspaper in Beijing. It said that while working in Zhejiang, Mr Li told a professor at Zhejiang University that the provincial government needed an \u201cindependent think-tank like the RAND Corporation\u201d in America to evaluate its performance. Mr Li said it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d for official bodies to provide objective analysis and for subordinates to criticise their superiors. The professor accordingly set up a \u201cnon-governmental\u201d group of experts in 2009 (though with a party stamp on it: Mr Li was appointed an honorary director). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "After taking over as Zhejiang\u2019s governor in 2013, Mr Li asked the experts to write reports on his work that \u201ctell the truth\u201d. The professor told the group: \u201cWe must act like the child in \u2018The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u2019.\u201d Still, Mr Li reportedly felt the experts\u2019 first attempt was not critical enough, so he paid them a visit to solicit face-to-face feedback that was more hard-hitting. On March 13th, at his first press conference after taking over as prime minister, Mr Li said he welcomed suggestions from netizens. On Weibo, a Twitter-like service, censors scrubbed many of their responses."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unusually for a senior ethnic-Han official, he flaunted his local identity, particularly his ties with Wenzhou. The city is renowned in China for its maverick streak, its citizens having shown a partiality for capitalism even in Mao\u2019s day. Its unique dialect, unintelligible to outsiders, fosters a sense in Wenzhou of being different (Mr Li has a hint of the accent). \u201cI was born and bred a Wenzhounese,\u201d he said at the inauguration in 2013 of the World Wenzhounese Conference, a group he set up to encourage members of the city\u2019s global diaspora to invest in their home town. \u201cThe Wenzhounese spirit of daring to be the first and especially of strong entrepreneurship has always inspired and nourished me.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Reducing bureaucratic interference in the market is one of his favourite themes. \u201cZhejiang is a place where reform and opening up began early and a sense of market rules is relatively strong,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2015. \u201cThese entrepreneurs should go to the market instead of being cultivated in a greenhouse.\u201d To be noted, however, is Mr Li\u2019s pioneering role in what became a nationwide government-backed effort to create \u201ccharacteristic towns\u201d, or industrial clusters focused on one type of business, with residential areas around them. Zhejiang\u2019s \u201cDream Town\u201d, for tech startups, and \u201cChocolate Town\u201d, for chocolate producers (and tourists), were among his early creations. As the idea spread across China, many such towns became speculative hotspots for housing developers, and the kinds of businesses they were supposed to cultivate sometimes failed to take off. Some became ghost towns."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In his speeches and interviews, Mr Li often spoke glowingly of Zhejiang\u2019s most famous private businessman, Jack Ma, the outspoken founder of Alibaba, an e-commerce giant. Read today, such remarks stand out: Mr Ma all but disappeared from public view in 2020. He had dared to criticise financial regulators in a speech. They responded by lashing out at Ant Group, Alibaba\u2019s financial affiliate, blocking its listing. That was the start of a regulatory onslaught against China\u2019s big tech firms. It wound down last year as the economy faltered and Mr Xi\u2014keen for private-sector support to revive it\u2014began to sound more emollient towards billionaires. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Li\u2019s appointment may help a bit to calm their nerves. But businesspeople will remain anxious. On March 10th the legislature approved a restructuring plan for the central government that is likely to result in further power being whittled away from the prime minister and being handed to Mr Xi. It also gave Mr Xi an unprecedented third term as president. Not one of the 2,952 delegates in attendance voted against him. Lest any netizen feel tempted to poke fun at such unanimity, Weibo blocked searches for \u201c#2952\u201d. If Mr Li has any different views of how China should be run, he will be super-cautious. He knows the emperor too well. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}]}
