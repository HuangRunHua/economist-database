When they emerge, pink-faced, into the open air, they plunge themselves into water-filled whiskey barrels. The highs, which come from alternating between temperatures, are not limited to hipsters in Hackney. Gabrielle Reason of the British Sauna Society reckons there are now 53 \u201cauthentic saunas\u201d across Britain, a number which has doubled every year since 2018. Half of them are on the coast, where visitors can plunge into the sea and then return to the heat.

When the queen died last year, one gay sauna live-streamed her funeral rather than its usual pornographic films in a profoundly moving show of respect. (Wary of seedy stereotypes, the Soul Water Sauna in Edinburgh is among those to ban \u201ctextile-free\u201d bathing.) But all agree on the health benefits. A sauna can reduce pain, improve mood and increase blood circulation. Mr Elliott believes that everyone should try it. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like trying to tell someone how to surf a wave or have an orgasm.
