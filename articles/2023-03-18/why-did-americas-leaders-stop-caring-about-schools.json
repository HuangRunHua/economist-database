"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is the kind of thing, earlier in this century, that Democrats used to fight about a lot, less with Republicans than among themselves. Under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, debates raged across the country over how to close academic-achievement gaps between poor minority children and rich white ones. That ferment subsided over the past decade as polarisation and the politics of identity and culture changed the priorities of both parties, leaving them ill-equipped to respond to the toll covid-19 took on America\u2019s future, as politicians like to call children."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Waving the banner of \u201cschool reform\u201d, mayors and superintendents in the Bush and Obama years pushed not just for more spending but for more competition, data and accountability. They wanted to link teacher evaluations and pay to student outcomes, measured by new tests. These reformers advocated shutting down bad schools and creating charter schools, generally unconstrained by union contracts, to invent new ways of engaging students. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nowhere were the changes more radical than in New York\u2019s system, America\u2019s biggest with nearly 1.1m students. As mayor, Michael Bloomberg graded schools and replaced those rated as failing with hundreds of smaller schools and charters. Some charters also failed, or came under fire for excessive discipline or cherry-picking applicants. But many exploited their greater flexibility to pay teachers more, lengthen the school year and enrich the curriculum. New York City\u2019s charter students consistently outperform those in district schools on the state\u2019s standardised tests."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bureaucratic inertia and political resistance were always strong, and the backlash after Mr Bloomberg\u2019s tenure was severe. To the ascendant progressives, in New York and nationally, reformers\u2019 emphasis on choice and competition stank of capitalism and their emphasis on testing of racism; charters reeked of both. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bloomberg\u2019s successor, Bill de Blasio, veered away from charters and testing and focused on creating a universal pre-kindergarten programme. He shifted attention from improving the worst schools to opening up access to the best: he fought unsuccessfully to eliminate the admissions test for New York\u2019s eight top public high schools, where Asian and white students are overrepresented relative to their numbers in the system."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then covid hit. The disruption in education appears to have wiped out 20 years of gains nationally in reading and maths among nine-year-olds. You might expect America to be obsessed with that, but it is not. Joe Biden has not made public education a priority. Republicans are opting for hysteria, fanning fears of indoctrination. Some are so indoctrinated themselves that Senator Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, did not have to explain any terms when, at a recent conservative conference, he compressed the party line into a perfect if accidental haiku: \u201cAll this woke, uh/Transgender athletes, uh/ CRT, 1619.\u201d The Republican panacea is vouchers, which would fragment public education by letting parents use taxpayer dollars for private schools."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Hochul may be lighting a path back to a more constructive debate. Because of the resistance to charter schools, their numbers have been capped in New York City at 275.

As the two sides negotiate over the budget, old arguments against charters are resurfacing. The state education commissioner, who is not appointed by the governor, wondered at one hearing why, if charters were so great, they tended to appear in mostly black and brown neighbourhoods, rather than white ones. \u201cThe argument is like saying if insulin is such a great drug, why isn\u2019t everyone taking it?\u201d fumes Miriam Raccah, who leads an outfit called the Black, Latinx, Asian Charter Collaborative, a group of 21 schools. \u201cRich white kids have options.\u201d"}, {"role": "second", "text": "Right to choose"}, {"role": "body", "text": "As on crime and policing, some progressives seem out of step on education with the communities they care about.
