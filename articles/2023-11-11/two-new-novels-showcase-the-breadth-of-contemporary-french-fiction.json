She was then a ten-year-old child; he, a teenager. Her mother did the ironing at his family villa. They went to his bedroom; he played a Dire Straits album, dazzled her. \u201cWhat exactly did that guy do?\u201d her father asks years later. \u201cNothing, Papa! Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d she retorts. But was that true? And was this new client in search of a defence lawyer really the teenager from all those years ago?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Thus begins the intrigue in Marie NDiaye\u2019s latest novel, \u201cVengeance is Mine\u201d, newly translated from French. The story centres on Ma\u00eetre Susane, a Bordeaux lawyer separated from her former partner and at odds with her parents. When young, she had cut her chestnut mane of hair, and her father briefly froze her out, \u201cas if someone had set out to diminish and humiliate him\u201d. Parental disapproval lingers. As the adult Ma\u00eetre Susane tries to peel back the memory of that afternoon in the bedroom, her mother\u2019s pained confusion about the episode exasperates her father. He asks his daughter not to contact them anymore."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Haunted by the puzzle, Ma\u00eetre Susane emerges as at once troubled and resilient, much like the female characters in Ms NDiaye\u2019s most celebrated novel, \u201cThree Strong Women\u201d, which won the Prix Goncourt, France\u2019s highest literary prize. Indeed, her latest work dwells as much on two other women linked to the intrigue as it does on the nature of the prospective client. Ms NDiaye has produced a tightly written story about womanhood, family strain and the ambiguity of recollection, into which she injects a consoling warmth."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In contrast to Ms NDiaye\u2019s concise, controlled prose, Mathias \u00c9nard takes the reader on a very different adventure. \u201cThe Annual Banquet of the Gravediggers\u2019 Guild\u201d is an earthy, Rabelaisian riot of a novel, dripping with slime, bugs, gluttony, death and bawdy decay. The novel begins and ends lightly enough. David Mazon, an anthropologist, steps off the high-speed train from Paris. He has come to research his doctoral thesis in a small village near the marshes of western France."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At times his quest is grimly comical. Repelled by insect life, David sloshes liquid bleach down the shower plughole to exterminate red worms\u2014the \u201cBashar al-Assad approach\u201d, he notes darkly. He strikes up a friendship with Martial, who doubles as the village mayor and its undertaker. When invited to have an aperitif in the back room of the funeral parlour, after a tour of oak and walnut coffins, David shudders to think that \u201cthe huge fridge from which they fetched the ice cubes was probably stocked with things like formalin, antiseptic and other pharmaceuticals used in post mortem surgical procedures.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The story soon morphs, however, from a first-person diary into the realm of the burlesque. At this point, the reader needs staying power. The village priest, it turns out, has been reincarnated as a wild boar. The red annelids David attacks with bleach in his shower are the souls of murderers sent in the distant past to the guillotine. Martial, meanwhile, is preparing for the annual undertakers\u2019 conference, a moment when death goes on pause."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The conference banquet is an indigestible feast of decadence and gourmandise: of hares, lamb, eels and pike \u201csaut\u00e9ed, in terrines, in quenelles, in aspic\u201d and \u201csoaring pyramids of egg mimosa\u201d. As the gravediggers, in various states of inebriation, take turns telling lewd tales and toasting death (\u201cthe one and only Mistress!\u201d), Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais\u2019s Gargantua is invoked. He hovers over their feasting as he does their evermore fantastical vocabulary. It is a dizzying concoction, which almost topples under its own inventive weight. In the end, though, it is held together by David\u2019s own story which, like Ma\u00eetre Susane\u2019s, carries a surprising tenderness. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 75}
