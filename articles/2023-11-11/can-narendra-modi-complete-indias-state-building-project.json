Until 2018 Kulajan, on the north bank of the Brahmaputra river, was poor and isolated. Crossing the river to reach the nearby commercial hub of Dibrugarh could take a day. Then Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, inaugurated the Bogibeel bridge, the country\u2019s longest rail-and-road crossing, cutting the journey time to less than an hour.

Long an embarrassment to the government in Delhi, the region\u2019s eight states are poor, insurgency-racked and mostly tucked away beyond neighbouring Bangladesh. No part of India\u2014not even restive Kashmir in the far north\u2014has been so little touched by its 76-year-long state-building effort. The Modi government has tried to change that."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231111_ASM983.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 658.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "It has accelerated infrastructure projects in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura (see map).

These efforts appeared to be succeeding\u2014until the eruption in May of ethnic conflict in Manipur.

The region\u2019s 50m people belong to dozens of ethnic groups, speak more than 200 languages and follow several religions. Many, including scores of militant bands, do not get along. The scar tissue of earlier interventions, British colonial and Indian, underlies their conflict. State borders imposed by the British jumbled tribal areas. The privileges some communities wrested from the central government\u2014a jobs quota here, a land settlement there\u2014enraged their neighbours. The conflict in Manipur was stirred by one such rivalry. The government in Delhi has sometimes intervened brutally. In 1966 India\u2019s then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered air strikes on the city of Aizawl, in what is now Mizoram, to quell a secessionist uprising. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many north-easterners feel little allegiance to India; other Indians tend to look on them suspiciously."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Recent governments have tried to woo the region with peacemaking and development. Yet as India\u2019s growth rate has picked up, the disparity between the north-east and elsewhere has increased. The region\u2019s share of GDP fell from 3.1% in 1991 to 2.6% in 2011. Mr Modi, in power since 2014, has sought to tackle this. His government speeded up infrastructure projects, improved relations with some ethnic groups and ordered administrators to make the north-east more \u201cIndian\u201d. The pace of road construction more than doubled during the first five years of his tenure; the total length of national highways in the region is approaching 16,000km, up from 8,500 in 2014. It has 17 civilian airports, compared with nine a decade ago. The current union budget includes 59bn rupees ($700m) for development in the north-east, twice the previous year\u2019s allocation.

It was sparked in May by plans to give Meiteis access to affirmative action and other measures reserved for Kukis. Yet the BJP, which invariably views communal relations through its Hindu-majoritarian lens, has hyped up the conflict\u2019s religious element, backing the Meiteis and casting the Kukis as criminals and insurgents. This has made a bad situation much worse. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Manipur\u2019s recent economic progress, for which the BJP had made great claims, has been undone.

With many fields and markets in effect inaccessible\u2014including to the many thousands huddled in over 300 refugee camps\u2014local agriculture is in crisis.
