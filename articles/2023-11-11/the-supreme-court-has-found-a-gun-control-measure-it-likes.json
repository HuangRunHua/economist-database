Cases reaching America\u2019s Supreme Court often pose tricky, even wrenching, dilemmas. But after 90 minutes of oral argument on November 7th, a case testing the boundaries of the court\u2019s recent expansion of gun rights looked unexpectedly easy to resolve."}, {"role": "body", "text": "United States v Rahimi involves Zackey Rahimi, a 23-year-old Texan whose girlfriend was granted a protective order in 2020 two months after Mr Rahimi assaulted her in a parking lot. The couple had been squabbling over custody of their child when Mr Rahimi knocked his girlfriend to the ground, dragged her to his car and pushed her inside. He then shot at an eyewitness and, later, threatened to shoot his girlfriend if she told anyone what he had done. The restraining order came with a suspension of his handgun licence and a caution that federal law prohibited him from possessing a gun. Mr Rahimi did not heed the warning. He shot at several drivers, used an AR-15 to fire into the house of a man to whom he had sold drugs and shot at a fast-food restaurant."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In March, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that while Mr Rahimi may not be a \u201cmodel citizen\u201d he is \u201cnonetheless among \u2018the people\u2019 entitled to the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantees\u201d. Drawing on the test in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v Bruen, the Supreme Court\u2019s gun-rights ruling from 2022, the Fifth Circuit searched for a historical analogue to the federal ban on firearms for domestic abusers under restraining orders. Finding no such match\u2014not surprisingly, given that domestic abuse was not on the founders\u2019 list of scourges in 1791\u2014America\u2019s most conservative appellate court found the federal law unconstitutional."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the 16 months since Bruen came down, many lower courts fielding challenges to gun regulations have read the decision in similarly stark terms. But in her presentation to the justices, Elizabeth Prelogar, the solicitor-general, argued that it is the principles undergirding regulations that matter. Judges, she said, should not \u201cnitpick\u201d or insist on a \u201chistorical twin\u201d when comparing a firearm restriction of today to the tradition of gun regulation at the founding."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas pressed Ms Prelogar to defend her position that only people who are \u201claw-abiding, responsible citizens\u201d may keep their guns. Responsibility is a \u201cvery broad concept\u201d, Chief Justice Roberts said. Can someone be deemed irresponsible\u2014and thus be disarmed\u2014because he didn\u2019t take the recycling to the kerb or behave at a basketball game? No, the solicitor-general explained, the language comes from Bruen and District of Columbia v Heller, the case of 2008 that found the Second Amendment protected an individual right to own guns. It means, she said, that the government can deny guns to felons and people who are otherwise found to be dangerous (due to mental illness, youth or violent tendencies). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Rahimi\u2019s lawyer, Matthew Wright, crumbled during his stint at the lectern. He raised questions about the fairness of the state-court proceeding that resulted in the restraining order\u2014and was reminded by Justice Neil Gorsuch that the case does not involve a due-process claim. He faltered when Justice Elena Kagan asked him to defend his brief\u2019s main contention that the ban must fall because no such ban existed \u201cwhile the founding generation walked the Earth\u201d. Jumping on his hesitancy, Justice Kagan turned the knife: \u201cI feel like you\u2019re running away from your argument, you know, because the implications of your argument are just so untenable.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Wright\u2019s dismal performance spurred Justice Amy Coney Barrett to admit being \u201cso confused\u201d and left Justice Thomas\u2014author of Bruen and the court\u2019s biggest gun-rights fan\u2014holding his hand over his eyes. Justice Thomas may yet side with Mr Rahimi; he seemed upset that the protective order was \u201ca small matter\u201d with \u201chuge consequences\u201d for the Texan\u2019s right to own guns. But a majority of the court seems unlikely to re-arm Mr Rahimi.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 25}
