In other parts of Ukraine, away from the front lines, reminders of the war are rare, the odd siren excepted. Bars and restaurants in Kyiv are packed; evening traffic is as thick as before the invasion. Thanks to improving air defences and warm weather, the blackouts triggered by Russian missile attacks last year have not yet resumed on a mass scale.

Every day the Russians lob hundreds of shells into Kherson from the Dnieper\u2019s opposite bank. Explosions, and the clap of outgoing fire, shake the city and its suburbs every few minutes. At Kherson\u2019s central market workers use plywood to replace windows shattered by a Russian missile that ripped through the area on October 27th. New windows would only get blown out again, says Iryna, a saleswoman. Russian shells killed at least five people in the city in the following week."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But amid the fear is defiance.

To place Kherson out of the range of enemy Grad rockets, Ukrainian troops would have to push the Russians, shielded by one of Europe\u2019s great rivers, back another 40km.

Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has publicly contradicted Valery Zaluzhny, the country\u2019s top military commander, who recently told The Economist that the war had reached a \u201cstalemate\u201d.

On November 6th, Mr Zelensky confirmed what many had already known, namely that a vote could not be held during wartime. A rare bit of good news for Ukraine came two days later, when the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, recommended the opening of membership talks with Ukraine.
