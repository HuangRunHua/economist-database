T.S. Eliot is thought never to have wanted songs made about his cats. Terry Pratchett, a British fantasy writer, had imagination: his former assistant honoured Pratchett\u2019s wish to have a steamroller crush a hard drive containing the author\u2019s unfinished stories. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Roald Dahl, author of dark, delightful children\u2019s tales, might have done something equally drastic had he known scriptwriters would conjure up a teenaged Willy Wonka. Dahl, who died in 1990, detested the first film made of his \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d. It is hard to imagine him cheering its prequel, \u201cWonka\u201d, which will be released in December. In it, young Willy, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (pictured), faces off against a chocolate cartel."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Authors have long tried to control what happens to their works after they die\u2014and mostly failed. Yet Dahl\u2019s legacy represents a new twist in the tale. Huge sums paid in 2021 for his estate by Netflix, a streaming service, have helped spur a gold rush to mine dead authors\u2019 estates. Once it was intrusion by snoopy biographers that worried writers most. Today it is the temptation among heirs to monetise every shred of creative output."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Voracious hunger for content from streaming services and film studios is driving this new interest in old books. Shrewd producers of tv and film, faced with bidding wars for hot new titles, have turned to more affordable options: novels written decades ago. The rights for these \u201cbacklist\u201d works generally belong to an estate for 70 years after an author\u2019s death. After that, the work enters the public domain, and estates can no longer profit from or control it. Consider \u201cWinnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\u201d, a film released this year, in which Pooh and Piglet, A.A. Milne\u2019s lovable, nearly 100-year-old characters, become bloodthirsty killers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Copyright-protected works are ripe for technological transformation. They can be milked in various ways, including selling the rights for translations into new languages, permitting \u201ccontinuation novels\u201d penned by living authors and making streaming series. For example, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit\u201d, which is best known as a show on Netflix, was actually based on a novel published in 1983."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Traditionally, managing the intellectual property of an author\u2019s estate was a low-key affair left to grand-nephews and harried former agents. The modern era of more actively exploiting rights began 15 years ago, when star agents in America and Britain started vying for the estates of Ian Fleming, Vladimir Nabokov and Evelyn Waugh. The heirs of Agatha Christie and Dahl, meanwhile, set up companies to oversee growing empires. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Dahl\u2019s grandson, who ran the Roald Dahl Story Company, sold the writer\u2019s catalogue to Netflix for an estimated $700m, the sleepy literary world woke up to the business potential of older works. (This was in addition to a separate deal already struck with Warner Bros, which gave the studio the right to make \u201cWonka\u201d.) A reimagining of \u201cThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\u201d and three other Dahl tales by Wes Anderson, a film-maker, arrived on Netflix in September; two series on the Oompa-Loompas and other Dahl characters are planned with Taika Waititi, a director from New Zealand."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even without the blockbuster treatment Dahl\u2019s work has got, estates can prove profitable, as old print titles are packaged into new formats. Audiobooks are booming; in America sales have risen by at least 10% annually in recent years, with a spike of 25% in 2021, according to the Audio Publishers Association, an industry group. Major book publishers recently announced a deal with Spotify, a streaming service, to offer audiobooks as a subscription. New formats could help authors\u2019 estates generate additional royalties. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The big money, though, is in screen adaptations. The global market for video streaming is expected to exceed $400bn by 2030. The year 2020 was the first time more books were turned into TV series than into films, according to Publishers Marketplace. Stories about spies, detectives and children\u2019s characters are natural subjects for shows. They are \u201cgolden brands\u201d, explains Nicola Solomon, boss of the Society of Authors, which acts as trustee for 58 of its members\u2019 estates. \u201cFor better or worse, we live in a brand-driven world, and people buy brands that are familiar,\u201d she adds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The bonanza has spawned a powerful new player. In 2019 a consortium of agents, lawyers and television promoters called International Literary Properties (ILP) set up shop in New York and London to do this at scale. \u201cThere are so many wonderful, unappreciated novels from the past,\u201d says Hilary Strong, the former chief executive of Agatha Christie Limited, who co-founded ILP. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is open them up and bring them back for new generations to understand.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Backed by private equity, ILP has acquired part or all of about 50 literary estates. Its portfolio now includes works of classic writers, such as Langston Hughes, Somerset Maugham and Georges Simenon. In 2021 the company sold rights for a drama series featuring Simenon\u2019s Parisian police inspector, Jules Maigret. With 84 Maigret novels to choose from, it does not take a detective to deduce that it could be a long-running show."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some heirs are flummoxed by the new corporate interest in their intellectual property. In effect, literary estates are a new kind of asset class. Managed well, they can provide steady income. And like tech startups, some hold \u201cthe potential for a sudden explosion\u201d, says Ms Solomon. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But many heirs and executors are just glad to find new audiences for their forebears\u2019 work. Take the novels of Octavia Butler, an African-American science-fiction pioneer, who died in 2006 after attracting many awards but little commercial success. Her estate, led by her former agent, authorised new editions, which in turn propelled the late author on to bestseller lists. New graphic novels have been published, and two tv shows are in development, including \u201cWild Seed\u201d, starring Viola Davis, an American actress."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Grave problems"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet resuscitating old stories comes with risks and thorny questions. Is it permissible to dress old stories in new packaging to appeal to contemporary tastes? And what should executors do about racist or sexist depictions? Attempts to \u201cupdate\u201d texts can easily blow up. Just think of the cries of \u201ccensorship\u201d when the estate of Dr Seuss decided to withdraw certain titles in 2021 because of the author\u2019s racial stereotyping. Most controversial are decisions to sanitise old books of offensive words, as editors at Penguin Random House did earlier this year with a string of Dahl\u2019s children\u2019s titles, which were reviewed by politically correct \u201csensitivity readers\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a scathing recent report, PEN, an advocacy group for authors, wrote that \u201cpart of the usefulness of reading older books is in critically evaluating their attitudes and arguments. Changing the text of classic books after their original publication is, in a sense, revising history.\u201d Michael Katakis, a writer who managed the Ernest Hemingway estate for more than 20 years, agrees. \u201cThe words from the past are signposts of where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019ve travelled from, and it is how we determine if we have improved or if we haven\u2019t moved very far at all.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Trickiest of all are so-called \u201ccontinuation novels\u201d, such as \u201cJulia\u201d, a brilliant recent retelling of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d from a feminist perspective. Traditionalists who might accept a new treatment of a classic in another medium often bridle at books that appear to change the intellectual legacy of a great author. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But controversy is not bad for sales. Like Dahl\u2019s beloved character Charlie Bucket, desperate to enter Wonka\u2019s mysterious factory, there is nothing to deter investors and film studios from continuing to sift through back catalogues in their hunt for a golden ticket. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 72}
