In September its top court ruled that the local government must rectify its failure to provide an \u201calternative framework for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships\u201d, though it did not call for full marriage equality. In October a different court ruled in favour of equal inheritance rights for same-sex couples. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The public would like the city to go further.

Now such officials are making decisions \u201cbased on their guess of what Beijing wants\u201d, says an activist.
