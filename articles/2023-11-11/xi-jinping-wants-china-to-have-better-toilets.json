Slowing economic growth and a teetering property market make it hard for them to service their massive debts. Some even struggle to pay public-sector workers. But instructions from Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s leader, are hard to ignore. In Guangyuan, a city in the south-western province of Sichuan, officials met last month to study his edicts relating to lavatories. Eradicating noxious facilities and building hygienic ones is a goal that Mr Xi heartily champions. In 2015 he called for a \u201ctoilet revolution\u201d. Political resolve helped China to create the world\u2019s largest high-speed rail network in a matter of years. With sanitation, however, politics can get in the way."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A revolution is much needed. Toilets in China are often rudimentary, especially in the countryside where until recent years it was common to squat on concrete slabs over a pit, with the waste left to accumulate for use as fertiliser or even consumption by pigs. Long before Mr Xi began using the term, UN officials and global health experts had been calling for a toilet revolution in poor countries to curb the spread of parasites and diseases such as diarrhoea and malaria. China had been making progress. In 1993 fewer than 8% of China\u2019s rural residents had access to toilets deemed sanitary by the government. By 2014 the proportion was about three-quarters. But the bar was low: even though septic tanks had become more common, few toilets were flush-types and many were still foul. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The effects of Mr Xi\u2019s campaign can be seen in many places. At tourist sites and at transport hubs, flush toilets, sometimes in extravagantly designed buildings (see picture), are now commonly available. As is loo paper\u2014though in some lavatories it is rationed by facial-recognition machines. In the countryside, particularly near big cities, public facilities have become much smarter, too. And in rural homes more than 50m toilets have been upgraded in the past five years with the help of government subsidies. By the end of this decade the goal is for all rural toilets to be linked to waste-sanitising systems. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Officials praise Mr Xi for this effort. They stress his personal involvement and how it shows his care for ordinary people\u2019s welfare. State media suggest that the policy\u2019s successes are evidence of China\u2019s political strength. \u201cLooking at human history, no country or political party has been able to mobilise an entire party and society in such a short period of time to carry out a nationwide top-down toilet revolution,\u201d Guangming Daily, a national newspaper, quoted a Chinese scholar as saying. \u201cThis is a concentrated embodiment of the superiority of the socialist system.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It might be thought that Mr Xi\u2019s close association with the project would make officials especially keen to do the job well. Another of his campaigns is aimed at instilling the bureaucracy with kanqi yishi, or \u201cconformity consciousness\u201d. This is defined as \u201cfirmly and consciously maintaining a high degree of alignment\u201d with the Communist Party leadership and \u201cComrade Xi Jinping at its core\u201d. In other words, those who defy Mr Xi\u2019s instructions, or drag their feet in following them, can expect trouble. But terrified officials do not necessarily make the most capable ones when it comes to sanitation work. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Coming a crapper"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In academic papers in China, and even in state media, reports abound of how the revolution has gone awry in some places. Richer parts of the country are performing well, but poorer areas far less so. At last month\u2019s meeting in Guangyuan, officials were shown a report on the toilet problem that was aired by state television in June. \u201cWhy are toilets that have been improved lying idle?\u201d were its opening words. After clips of interviews with grumbling residents of a village in Hunan province (and a defensive local official), the narrator intoned another question: \u201cWhat have been the results of these showy achievements?\u201d The farmers blamed the local government for shoddy installation, including the use of fragile plastic pipes, and for certifying the work as adequate even though it appeared that proper inspections had not been carried out. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is often thus with top-down mandates\u2014in their hurry to implement them, officials are wont to neglect the need for quality. In part this is a product of the way funding usually works for such schemes. The central government pays for part of the work, but leaves local governments to pick up the rest of the tab, often a much bigger share. Between 2015 and 2018, about 1bn yuan ($140m) was disbursed from the central coffers in Beijing for the purpose of toilet improvements. Funding from local governments and other sources was more than 20 times that amount, according to Chinese media. Corner-cutting is naturally more common in less-wealthy regions. The village in Hunan featured in the television report is in one of the province\u2019s poorest counties. \u201cIn some places, due to financial issues, they have had to halt toilet-renovation projects,\u201d said an article published in July in the Journal of Smart Agriculture, a Chinese publication. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It does not help that officials often take a cookie-cutter approach to such tasks, with little effort made to solicit the views of residents. Flush toilets are Mr Xi\u2019s favourite type\u2014state media say that during his inspection tours, he often asks rural residents whether they have them. But in their anxiety to please him, bureaucrats sometimes ignore climate and geography when foisting flush loos on villagers. Plumbing is prone to freeze during northern China\u2019s harsh winters and water is often scarce in many parts of the country. In Shenyang, the capital of the north-eastern province of Liaoning, many new toilets built in the surrounding countryside between 2016 and 2019 became unusable because of the cold. In 2021 Xinhua, a news service run by the government, said that of 80,000 toilets upgraded in the Shenyang area in the previous five years, at a cost of 100m yuan, 50,000 had fallen into disuse because of design flaws, poor construction or inadequate maintenance. \u201cA project to benefit the people has turned into one that breaks their hearts,\u201d the report said of Shenyang\u2019s experience. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Around the country, adult villagers are usually elderly, with younger people having migrated to cities to work. Officials spend little time teaching the old-timers how to use the new toilets, and why they are necessary. So some loos end up little-used as villagers revert to the familiar old-style squat types. \u201cMost villagers have long-established toilet habits that are hard to change,\u201d said an article in July in Rural Economy and Science-Technology, another Chinese journal. \u201cSome villagers think that flush toilets entail additional expenses and consider investing in them a waste of money\u2026Some even think it\u2019s a purely cosmetic project\u2026and have little interest in the \u2018toilet revolution\u2019.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The party has clearly decided to give the media somewhat freer rein to report difficulties with the toilet campaign than it normally would with projects dear to Mr Xi\u2019s heart. This may be calculated: exposing misconduct and slapdash implementation is not likely to affect his or the party\u2019s image, only that of local leaders. In April the rural-affairs ministry announced that this year the toilet revolution would focus on \u201craising quality\u201d. Inspectors would be sent to villages to look at how well toilets were working and being maintained (having spent money on building better loos, local governments often scrimp by not looking after them).

In July they announced their findings: nearly 330,000 households had not received the full amount they were owed as subsidies for building better toilets. More than 4.5m yuan had been falsely declared as having been used for toilet maintenance and management. Funds earmarked for the revolution had been diverted to other purposes. Official reports implied that financial stress was mainly to blame. Some of the money had been spent instead on education, health care and housing. One county had used it to repay government debt. In these straitened times, it is unlikely to be the only one. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 18}
