No longer. Generative AI is hoovering up copyrighted work and churning out remixed literature, music and video of all varieties, increasingly competing with humans in quality and already far outpacing them in quantity.

At the same time, the number making $5m or more increased by 165%, and the handful of headliners making $10m or more increased by 425% (see chart 1 on previous page).
