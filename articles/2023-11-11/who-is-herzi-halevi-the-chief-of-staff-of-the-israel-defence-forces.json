In January 2023, when he became chief of general staff of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), the most senior position in Israel\u2019s army, the officer and reserve corps were rent by divisions over proposed reforms to the country\u2019s Supreme Court. Some reservists threatened not to serve if the divisive prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and his far-right coalition passed laws weakening the powers of the court. It was one of the army\u2019s most turbulent periods in recent times. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hamas\u2019s murder of 1,400 Israelis, and capture of more than 200 hostages, eclipsed all that. General Halevi is now commanding an aerial and ground offensive against the militant group in Gaza, in which more than 10,000 Palestinians have died, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Popular rage at the way Israel is conducting the war has inspired protests in many countries. The UN human-rights office says that Israel may have committed a war crime when it struck the Jabalia refugee camp. A minister in the Netanyahu government raised the possibility of using nuclear weapons against Gaza (he was suspended for his remarks). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But in General Halevi Israel has a commander with a strong reputation for upholding legal and ethical standards in the conduct of warfare. What is his background and how might it influence how he prosecutes the war? He was born in 1967 in Jerusalem and named after his uncle, who had been killed in action a few months earlier in the Six Day War. His mother\u2019s family had lived in the city for 14 generations; his paternal grandparents emigrated from Russia. His father\u2019s father was a member of Irgun, a Zionist paramilitary group active in the years leading up to the establishment of Israel. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The general began his regular army service at the age of 18, as a paratrooper, and started training to be an officer two years later. During the early years of his career he skirmished with Hizbullah, a Shia militant group in southern Lebanon that is now exchanging shellfire with Israel, and joined Sayeret Matkal, a special-forces unit that conducts secret operations deep in Arab countries, which he eventually commanded. He next headed a brigade in the occupied West Bank. In 2009, he led paratroopers in Gaza, in a ground offensive in the towns north of Gaza city where the IDF is fighting once again. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As commander of the Galilee Division from 2011 General Halevi led the IDF on the border with Lebanon. He became head of military intelligence in 2014 and of the Southern Command from 2018, with responsibility for deterring Hamas. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was after his experience in the Gaza war of 2008-09, in which hundreds of Palestinian civilians died, that he became an outspoken advocate of the legal and ethical conduct of warfare. In a lecture in 2009 he criticised other Israeli field commanders for failing to set \u201cmoral standards\u201d for soldiers fighting in urban areas with many civilians present. \u201cA soldier cannot go into battle with a law book,\u201d he said, but commanders have a responsibility to ensure that moral and legal standards are upheld. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "General Halevi\u2019s views belong to an Israeli military tradition. Yitzhak Sadeh, a leader of the Haganah, a Zionist militia that was the forerunner of the IDF, coined the term \u201cpurity of arms\u201d and warned fighters against acts of wanton retribution. But the IDF also had commanders who ignored such principles. As a young commando officer in 1953 Ariel Sharon, who was prime minister between 2001 and 2006, led a reprisal in Qibya, a village in the West Bank, then controlled by Jordan, that killed 69 Palestinians. Three decades later an Israeli commission found that Sharon, then defence minister, had not acted to prevent the massacre by Israel\u2019s allies of Palestinians in refugee camps in Lebanon. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "General Halevi is leading the IDF at a time when the ethics of Sadeh are under challenge from the vengeful spirit of Sharon. The IDF has gone deeper into Gaza city than it did in 2009 and 2014 and Hamas is better prepared with more fortifications and tunnels. With civilian casualties spiralling, intense bombardments and close-quarters fighting under way, the concept of an ethical and legal war is being tested to the brink. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "After the current fighting in Gaza is over, General Halevi\u2019s roles as head of the Southern Command and of the IDF overall will come under scrutiny. Hamas\u2019s surprise attack in October showed an extraordinary lapse in intelligence gathering. General Halevi was the first senior official to accept responsibility, saying on October 12th that \u201cthe IDF is responsible for the security of the state and its citizens\u201d and that on the morning of the attack \u201cwe failed\u201d. People close to him believe that he intends to resign in the not-too-distant future. But first he has his last war to fight. \u25a0"}], "id": 79}
