The museum\u2019s main criterion is that works were banned or censored in some way.

There is a roomful of prayer mats with holes cut in them, where a pair of stiletto heels fits, by Zoulikha Bouabdellah, an artist of Algerian descent. In \u201cPi\u00e8ge \u00e0 loup\u201d by Amina Benbouchta, a Moroccan artist, a wolf-trap lies on top of an embroidered pillow.

In 2006 officials in several European countries declined to show \u201cShark\u201d out of fear, because of the violence triggered by cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in Danish newspapers. No work depicting the prophet appears in the museum, perhaps for that reason, though it may show one in the future."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indeed, one of the museum\u2019s strongest points is highlighting the nature of censorship itself. The crudest version of it is a straightforward state ban: policemen rip artwork off walls and lock it away. But some works are attacked by individuals. The painting of the masturbating Madonna, for example, was vandalised at an exhibition in 2019 and still bears the slash of a knife. And many works in the museum were censored by the artists themselves. For example, Francisco Goya withdrew his \u201cCaprichos\u201d, viciously satirical etchings, from sale, fearing the unwelcome attention of the Spanish Inquisition."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sometimes companies and institutions squash free expression. Lego \u201cdeclined\u201d to send a bulk order of bricks to Ai Weiwei, a Chinese dissident artist, saying it avoided endorsing projects with a political agenda. Instead Mr Ai sourced bricks from supporters, in a triumph over corporate caution.
