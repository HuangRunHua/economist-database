Biographies, memoirs and salacious tell-alls about these big-tech bosses have shaped readers\u2019 understanding of how the online world changes the offline one. But these books rarely mention the principal figures who have shaped the experience of being online: social-media influencers.

People like Jackie Aina, Matilda Djerf and Molly-Mae Hague earn a living from a combination of sponsored posts (#sponcon), commissions made through affiliate links and by creating their own brands, from fake tan to eyeshadows to loungewear lines. According to Forbes, more than 50m people globally describe themselves as influencers; Goldman Sachs predicts the industry will double to nearly $500bn by 2027.

But a new crop of books takes the influencer industry more seriously by exploring the way social media\u2019s most popular users are reshaping the global economy and changing what the average person views online. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Taylor Lorenz, a technology writer for the Washington Post, is a leading voice on social-media trends and internet culture. Her book, \u201cExtremely Online\u201d, argues that influencers hold huge power: \u201cTech founders may control the source code, but users shape the product.\u201d Charting the history of the influencer (once called \u201ce-celebs\u201d or \u201cceWEBrities\u201d) from the 1990s to today, Ms Lorenz argues influencers rose by making fame and luxury less \u201csealed off\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like reality-TV stars, early influencers created a new, niche sort of celebrity, popular enough to draw scrutiny but still unrecognisable to most. Ms Lorenz makes the case that, despite its bad rap, influencing has \u201cgiven more people the chance to benefit directly from their labour than at any other time in history\u201d, regaling readers with stories about \u201cmommy bloggers\u201d turning the pain of parenthood into six-figure businesses and teens becoming multi-millionaires off short comedy skits.

She also examines influencers\u2019 new role in traditional media, with TV and film studios harvesting stars and storylines from the content on these accounts. Some TikTokers, such as Addison Rae, have starred in films, as well as reality television.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Lorenz\u2019s take on influencing is optimistic. She is not alone. \u201cBad Influence\u201d reflects on a decade of influencing, and also paints a honeyed picture of influencers\u2019 function in culture. \u201cWe are photographers, videographers, copywriters, directors, editors, models and marketing team all rolled into one,\u201d Oenone Forbat, an influencer, writes in her memoir, which offers intimate details about the haphazard quality of influencers\u2019 fame. However, despite its Panglossian sheen, the strength of \u201cBad Influence\u201d is its meditation on the deep-seated paranoia that comes with being constantly exposed to so many people."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And there are plenty of reasons to be anxious: for every fan, there is a critic. A vehement one is Symeon Brown, who looks at the industry\u2019s underbelly, full of scammers, surgeries, racism and exploitation, in his entertaining \u201cGet Rich or Lie Trying\u201d. Mr Brown, a journalist, tells gory stories of influencers who took part in scams. Sometimes people who get tricked end up becoming \u201cinfluencer scammers\u201d themselves. He chronicles the experience of one woman losing tens of thousands to the now-defunct Trump University, which ran real-estate training programmes; she then launched a similar scheme. He argues that this is influencers\u2019 real impact: making exploitation more accessible, widespread and far wilier than it was in its pre-internet days.

As the number of believable posts and photos produced by AI soars, influencers will face significantly more competition for internet users\u2019 attention.
