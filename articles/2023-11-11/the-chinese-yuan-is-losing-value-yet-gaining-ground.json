Long before Foxconn started making iPhones for Apple, manufacturers from Hong Kong tiptoed across the border to Guangdong in search of cheap labour.

Although the country will most probably meet its official growth target of 5% this year, it could shrink in dollar terms, according to the imf\u2019s latest forecasts.

It is becoming harder for foreign investors to find opportunities that are both commercially exciting and politically palatable in their home and host countries.

As interest rates remain high in America and fall in China, multinational companies have an incentive to spirit spare cash out of the country and unwind any loans to their subsidiaries that can be replaced with Chinese funding. \u201cMany firms can now borrow more cheaply in China and nearly all can earn a higher return on their financial reserves by moving them offshore,\u201d points out Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics, a research firm."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The combination of an interest-rate gap and a geopolitical gulf has, then, hurt one kind of globalisation.

Indeed, more than half of mainland China\u2019s transactions with the rest of the world are now settled in its own currency, points out Mr Evans-Pritchard. In the pioneering province of Guangdong the share is even higher, at over 54% in the first three quarters of this year. Guangdong\u2019s workers never got Mickey to embrace a red nose.
