It could have been any of the 650 professional rodeos sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), the oldest and largest rodeo group, which 6m Americans attend each year. But instead, this was the Indian National Finals Rodeo (INFR), which recently took place in Las Vegas. Contestants were members of the 574 Native American tribes, and most of the 20,000 attendees were Native American, too.

The sport is remarkably popular among tribal members: though Native Americans account for only 3% of America\u2019s population, the INFR claims 3,500 cowboys and cowgirls, around half the members the PRCA has. Native competitors are becoming increasingly prominent in mainstream rodeo, too. Among the biggest stars are Dakota Louis, a bull-rider (pictured), and Derrick Begay, a roper, who will compete in the PRCA\u2019s National Finals Rodeo, held in December (also in Las Vegas).

It is \u201cone of the few opportunities in Indian country to get out, to make a living, to get an education\u201d, says Bo Vocu, a retired bull-rider and president of the INFR. Unemployment among Native Americans is more than double the national average and hovers around 50% on some reservations. With jobs scarce, bull-riding and roping can offer income and even bring college scholarships.

It is also a celebration of the fact that many Indians have long been cowboys and \u201crodeoed\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The sport is often associated with white cowboys. But modern rodeo, which began in the 1880s and 1890s, was originally a \u201cvery multicultural, multilingual space\u201d, says Rebecca Scofield, an associate professor of history at the University of Idaho. Rodeos brought together European immigrants, Mexican vaqueros, freed blacks and Native Americans. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rodeo\u2019s name comes from the Spanish rodear, \u201cto round up\u201d. Regular round-ups to sort and brand cattle led to competitions to see who could rope and ride with the greatest skill. In 1888 a rodeo in Prescott, Arizona, was the first to charge admission and among the first to award prizes. By 1922, rodeo had even reached Madison Square Garden. As rodeo cowboys unionised in the first decades of the 20th century, some organisations explicitly excluded blacks and Native Americans, who were often relegated to separate events. By the late 1940s, the stereotypical rodeo cowboy had become \u201cwhite, straight and hyper-masculine\u201d, according to Ms Scofield.

With poverty and mental illness high on reservations, rodeo is a celebration of \u201cresilience\u201d. It is also a \u201ca way to feel free,\u201d since it facilitates travel, says Delphine Red Shirt, a lecturer in Native American Studies at Stanford. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indian rodeos offer practice for competitors to be bucked off and beaten up as they develop the skills required to succeed on the higher-paying, mainstream rodeo circuit. The INFR is \u201cpushing more Indian cowboys to get out there\u201d rather than \u201cjust chase their local rodeos\u201d, according to Bo Tyler Vocu, Mr Vocu\u2019s son, a talented bronc- and bull-rider."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pro rodeo has begun to embrace Native American participants, in no small part because tribal riders come with a devoted following. Many Native Americans know someone who rodeos or have rodeoed themselves. As the sport seeks to shore up its audience (as white rural populations shrink), rodeo will only continue to get more diverse. The rodeo of the future may well look more like the rodeo of the past. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 76}
