Imperialists at heart, they often meddled in one another\u2019s neighbourhoods and jostled for control of Asia\u2019s trade routes. Lately, however, America has changed the dynamic. In 2020, two years after exiting a deal limiting Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, it reimposed a trade embargo on the country; more penalties were announced in January, to punish Iran for backing Hamas and Houthi rebels. Russia fell under Western sanctions in 2022, after invading Ukraine, which were recently tightened. Meanwhile, China faces restrictions of its own, which could become much more stringent if Donald Trump is elected president in November. United by a common foe, the trio now vow to advance a common foreign policy: support for a multipolar world no longer dominated by America. All see stronger economic ties as the basis for their alliance."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China has promised a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Russia, and signed a 25-year \u201cstrategic agreement\u201d with Iran in 2021. All three countries are members of the same multilateral clubs, such as the BRICS. Bilateral trade is growing; plans are being drawn up for tariff-free blocs, new payment systems and trade routes that bypass Western-controlled places. For America and its allies, this is the stuff of nightmares. A thriving anti-Western axis could dodge sanctions, win wars and recruit other malign actors. The entente involves areas where links are already strong, others where collaboration is only partial and some unresolved questions. What might the alliance look like in five to ten years?

The result has been a surge in Chinese imports, with the beneficiaries not China\u2019s state-owned firms, which could one day be exposed to sanctions, but smaller \u201cteapot refineries\u201d with no presence abroad.

In contrast, China is only subject to restrictions on imports of Western technology\u2014it does not face financial bans or trade embargoes. Therefore it can, and does, buy oil from other countries, which gives it the upper hand in negotiations with its allies. China gets Russian and Iranian supplies at a discount of $15-30 a barrel on the global oil price, and then processes the cheap hydrocarbons, turning them into higher-value products. The production capacity of its petrochemicals industry has grown more in the past two years than that of all other countries combined since 2019. China also cranks out enormous volumes of refined-oil products.

Everyone wants oil; once on a ship, it can be sent anywhere. Yet China has an informal policy of limiting dependence on any commodity supplier to 15-20% of its total needs, meaning that it is close to the maximum it will want to import from Russia. Although the trade is still enough to provide Russia and Iran with a lifeline, it is helpful only if they can spend the hard currency earned on importing goods. Hence the ambition to develop other types of trade."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240323_FNC455.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s exports to Russia have duly soared. As covid-19 rules strangled its economy, China sought to compensate by boosting manufacturing exports. Instead of shoes and t-shirts, it tried to sell high-value wares, such as machinery and mechanical devices, for which Russia acted as a test market. Last year the biggest importer of Chinese automobiles was not Europe, a destination for its electric vehicles, but Russia, which purchased three times as many petrol cars it did as before the war.

Yet China exports few parts and just 300-500 cars a month to Iran, compared with 3,000 or so to neighbouring Iraq.

Early this year Iran also sent Russia 1m barrels of crude by tanker, another first. But sanctions make deeper ties tricky.

At recent summits, Iranian and Russian ministers have revived negotiations to extend the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200km route connecting Russia to the Indian Ocean via Iran. At present Russian grain must travel to the Middle East through the NATO-controlled Bosporus. The proposal, which includes a mixture of roads, rail and ports, could turn Iran into an export outlet for Russia. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Iran\u2019s and Russia\u2019s bureaucracies have relatively little experience of working with one another, and the amount of investment required is daunting: the Russia-backed Eurasian Development Bank estimates it to be $26bn in Iran and Russia alone. Mustering such funding, in two countries not known for investor friendliness, would be hard at the best of times, let alone under sanctions. Still, the idea is gaining traction. On February 1st envoys discussed the next steps for the Rasht-Astara railway, a $1.6bn project that could ease freight transport in northern Iran. Last year Russia used part of the INSTC to move goods to Iran by rail for the first time.

Only two of Russia\u2019s 15 most-wanted goods count among Iran\u2019s top exports.

Since the West imposed an embargo on Russia\u2019s oil, the country has been vying with Iran to win a bigger share of China\u2019s imports, resulting in a price war. It is a battle that Iran is losing. Russia is a bigger oil producer and its energy is not subject to secondary sanctions. Some of its crude can also be piped to China, a cheaper option.

Early in the war, Ukraine\u2019s supporters feared that Russia and Iran would team up to evade sanctions. Instead, Russia developed its own \u201cshadow\u201d fleet of tankers and gave no access to the Iranians, says Yesar Al-Maleki of MEES, a research outfit. Iran has sought Russian funds and technology to tap its giant gas reserves; Russia has provided little help so far.

Until recently, the Islamic Republic\u2019s sizeable manufacturing base and home market was a source of resilience. The country could take advantage of a devalued currency to sell things like nuts and toiletries, says Esfandyar Batmanghelidj of Bourse &amp; Bazaar Foundation, another think-tank. Its hope, in time, was to climb the value chain, exporting air-conditioning units and perhaps even cars. China is dashing such dreams. As it shifts towards higher-value exports, it is flooding Iran\u2019s target markets with cheaper, better versions of these goods."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The West has little appetite for wholesale secondary sanctions. But existing measures will cause trouble. In December America announced penalties for anyone dealing with Russian firms in industries including manufacturing and technology. These look similar to those it imposed on Iran in 2011, which were suspended in 2015, after the nuclear deal was signed. Before the suspension, the measures caused Iran\u2019s imports from China to plummet. There is evidence that some Chinese banks are already dumping Russian business. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although these new sanctions do not target Russia\u2019s energy sector, they could hinder Russia\u2019s oil trade with customers other than China if banks react by pausing business with the energy giant. Since October America has also imposed penalties on 50 tankers that it says breach sanctions on Russia; around half of them have not loaded any of the country\u2019s oil since. All this is making exports to China both more necessary and more difficult for Russia, which is bound to increase competition with Iran. America could further fan the flames by leaning on Malaysia to inhibit oil smuggling in its waters, choking off Iranian flows. And China itself is under growing scrutiny. In February the EU announced sanctions on three Chinese firms it reckons are helping Russia.

The likeliest scenario is that it remains a vehicle that serves China\u2019s interests, rather than becoming a true partnership. China will use it for as long as it can reap opportunistic gains, and stop short of giving it full backing. The country\u2019s officials will decline to put weight behind alternative trade routes or payment systems, not wanting to put at risk business in the West.

With nothing more to lose, China would then put far greater resources into forming an alternative bloc, and would inevitably attempt to build on existing relationships and broaden its alliances. Junior partners may not be pleased: their manufacturing industries would suffer as China redirected its exports. America would also suffer: its consumers would pay more for their imports, and in time its leaders would see the first serious challenge to their dominance of the global trading system. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Clarification (March 21st 2024): This article no longer states that China\u2019s \u201cstrategic agreement\u201d with Iran involves $400bn, owing to uncertainty about the figure."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 55}
