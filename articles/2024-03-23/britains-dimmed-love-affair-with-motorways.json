Junction 11 is rarely a popular choice for a Friday night out. Indeed the M25 is rarely popular at all. The road\u2014which encircles London and is Britain\u2019s busiest\u2014is also one of its most loathed. Chris Rea, a musician, wrote a song called \u201cRoad to Hell\u201d about it; Terry Pratchett, an author, argued that its mere existence was evidence of Satan\u2019s own. The news that it was\u2014for the first time ever\u2014going to close during the daytime so that a bridge could be demolished was received by many as just the sort of irritating thing that the M25 would do. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The M25 annoys because it is too big (its 117 miles received thousands of planning objections before it opened in 1986) and because it is too small (it promptly became known as \u201cBritain\u2019s biggest car park\u201d). It irritates because it is too prominent (embankments were dug and 2m trees were planted to try to screen it) and because it is too recessed (drivers cannot relish the rolling English countryside but snake through an endless cutting). The phrase \u201cwithin the M25\u201d is used to denote smug metropolitans; smug metropolitans, in turn, say \u201cbeyond the M25\u201d to signify \u201cthere be monsters\u201d (or at least no decent flat whites). It is not, in short, a particularly well-liked road."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is, though, an important one. For its construction helps mark the moment when Britain fell out of love with motorways. As multi-lane roads started to unspool across the country, Britons were initially delighted. When the M1, Britain\u2019s first intercity motorway, opened in 1959 Britons took day trips on it. Postcards were sold of such appealing bits of tarmac as \u201cThe M1 near Newport Pagnell\u201d, \u201cA40 Traffic\u201d and \u201cThe Underpass, Croydon\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There were some sceptics. One transport minister warned, to later smirking, that by travelling at such speed \u201csenses may be numbed and judgment warped\u201d (anyone who has ever wondered who pays to sit in the massage chairs at Thurrock services might agree with him). But mostly Britons were thrilled. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "By the 1970s Britain had 1,000 miles of modern motorways. Or modernish. In his book \u201cOn Roads\u201d, Joe Moran points out that Britain\u2019s roads are part transport system, part palimpsest. The runway on which Neville Chamberlain landed when returning from Munich was incorporated into a strikingly straight section of the M4; a map of Britain\u2019s motorways is an uncanny echo of the Antonine Itinerary, a third-century road book."}, {"role": "body", "text": "By the time work on the M25 began, the ardour had not gone but it was dimming: at its opening Margaret Thatcher complained at those who \u201ccarp and criticise\u201d. \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u201d, first broadcast as a radio play in 1978, opens as the hero, Arthur Dent, learns that Earth is to be demolished for a hyperspace bypass. He lies in front of a digger, refuses to move and tells the builders to \u201cGo away, and take your bloody bypass with you.\u201d Thanks in part to such objections Britain\u2019s too-narrow roads often don\u2019t see much movement either. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Which is why the M25, always too small, is being closed several times this year to allow bridges to be demolished and lanes to be widened. Among the gaggle watching this month\u2019s first closure at Junction 11 there is carping and criticism aplenty: the closure is later and duller than expected, the temperature colder. By the time the last cone is in place and the massive motorway emptied, it is almost 11pm. A spectator turns to head home. That, he says, was \u201crather underwhelming\u201d. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
