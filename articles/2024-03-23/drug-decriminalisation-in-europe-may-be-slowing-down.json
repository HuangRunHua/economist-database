WEED? Cocaine?\u201d In central Lisbon, even your grey-haired correspondent gets the pitch. The Vale de Alc\u00e2ntara, a valley housing a main road alongside a park, is strewn with garbage and drug paraphernalia. Dealers and users huddle in a strip of dilapidated buildings. Nearby is a government-run facility where they can get high safely. But it is often full, and some like it better outside."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Portugal is held up as a model of drug liberalisation. In 2001 it decriminalised possession of all drugs for personal use. Selling remains illegal, but the government\u2019s \u201charm-reduction\u201d strategy softens the role of the police. Instead it offers therapy to those who want to quit and \u201cdissuasion commissions\u201d with a range of interventions, from fines to travel bans, to shove them in that direction. It also helps provide clean needles and tests for drug purity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such policies, and similar ones in the Netherlands, are credited with reversing epidemics of addiction in the 1980s and 1990s, limiting drug-related crime and disease. Despite political resistance, many European countries have gradually followed this trend towards harm reduction."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But second thoughts are rising. In some countries open-air use of hard drugs is more visible; in others, such as Sweden and the Netherlands, gang violence is up. This has led some politicians to go back to advocating tougher law enforcement."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240323_EUC875.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Portugal\u2019s reforms are still seen as successful. In the 1990s, notes Jo\u00e3o Goul\u00e3o, head of the country\u2019s drug-policy unit, perhaps 1% of the population used heroin. Since the switch from criminalisation to harm reduction, needle-borne HIV infections have fallen from around 1,800 in 1999 to 20 in 2022 (see chart); deaths from overdoses by four-fifths. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the financial crisis and the pandemic have led to drug relapses. Poor immigrant populations have become heavily represented among addicts, stirring discontent in Porto, Portugal\u2019s second city, where open-air use had spread to richer neighbourhoods. The city council and mayor called for penalties for taking drugs in public places, especially near hospitals and schools. Discontent over drugs is also rising in the Netherlands, once known for its liberal drug policies. When an apartment thought to house a drug lab blew up in Rotterdam on January 29th, killing three people, the mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, was, coincidentally, in Colombia to learn about combating drug cartels. Femke Halsema, Amsterdam\u2019s mayor, said the Netherlands risked becoming a \u201cnarco-state\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is an exaggeration, but reflects growing concerns. In the 1970s the government wanted to legalise cannabis altogether, but settled for decriminalising possession. Police began tolerating caf\u00e9s where joints could be smoked on the premises or bought in small amounts to take away. In 1995 a new law began registering such \u201ccoffee shops\u201d. Tourists streamed into them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Heroin was the more dangerous problem. In the 1980s authorities promoted harm reduction, the world\u2019s first needle-exchange programme, substitution therapy with drugs such as methadone, drug-testing centres and safe-injection rooms. In the early 2000s a few hundred addicts who repeatedly failed substitution therapy were even given free heroin at government facilities. This seemed to work: by 2010 the heroin-addict cohort was small and ageing. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Decriminalising marijuana possession, too, came to be seen as a success, with scant violence around small sales and usage little higher than in countries nearby. Others have eventually not only decriminalised but legalised cannabis: Malta, Luxembourg and, on February 23rd, Germany."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But in the Netherlands many do now see drug tourism as a plague. Amsterdam has banned smoking marijuana on the street in its red-light district and cut the number of coffee shops by two-fifths. Other cities have restricted access to Dutch citizens only\u2014but illegal dealers have returned as a result."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And although heroin use has declined, party drugs are on the rise. The number of Dutch adults who said they had used cocaine in the past year rose from 1.6% in 2015 to 2.4% in 2022. The rise of cocaine has led to a rise in violent trading. On February 28th a Dutch court ended the country\u2019s biggest ever drug-gang trial, sentencing Ridouan Taghi, a syndicate boss, to life in prison for ordering a string of killings. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gang activity is not led mainly by Dutch demand: consumption has been rising across Europe, and the Netherlands is ideal for distribution, thanks to the huge ports at Rotterdam and Amsterdam and to Schiphol airport. In 2023 police seized 60 tonnes of cocaine at Dutch ports, up from 51 the year before. But as the police at the biggest ports have become tougher, the traffic has shifted to smaller ones."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The flaws in both the war on drugs and the ceasefire strategy have made other countries pursue half-measures. Norway considered Portuguese-style decriminalisation in 2021, only for the coalition of support to crumble at the last minute; it is pursuing piecemeal changes instead. Denmark, where hash has been tolerated in Christiania, a commune-like neighbourhood in Copenhagen, is going through one of its occasional crackdowns, after a gang murder last summer. And though Germany has just legalised possession of cannabis, it stopped short of making it available for sale in shops or chemists. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Paul Griffiths, the science director at the European Union\u2019s drug-monitoring agency, says that too much focus is put on criminal policy alone. Global factors play a big role; for example the Taliban\u2019s supression of opium-poppy production could lead European heroin supplies to dry up. His agency fears the rise of ultra-potent synthetic opioids called nitazenes, which have caused a surge of deaths in Estonia and Latvia. Fentanyl, which has ravaged America, has not yet reached Europe in great quantities, but it may only be a matter of time before it surges in."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In any case, says Mr Griffiths, drug policy cannot be applied in isolation. It must be joined with health care, housing, public education and other services. Europe features strong welfare states, which is one big reason 6,000-7,000 die of overdoses there each year, compared with around 100,000 in America with a similar population. But that does not make the traffic or use of drugs cost-free. Harm reduction, after all, does still imply harm. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 36}
