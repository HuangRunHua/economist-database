Medication abortion has been an increasingly popular option since 2000, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved mifepristone as part of a two-drug regimen with misoprostol. More recently, the FDA widened the window during which the medicine may be used and eased dispensing requirements. But on March 26th the Supreme Court will consider whether these loosened regulations should be tightened back up."}, {"role": "body", "text": "FDA v Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine began as an assault on the FDA\u2019s original approval of mifepristone. In April 2023 the district-court judge in Texas who heard the case invalidated the authorisation from 2000 and each of the subsequent liberalisations. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals kept mifepristone on the shelves when it pared back this extraordinary ruling last August. But the appeals court agreed that the 2016 and 2021 changes\u2014allowing the drug to be used through ten weeks of pregnancy (up from seven) and to be sent to women by post with a remote prescription\u2014had to go."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The plaintiffs will be represented at the Supreme Court by Erin Hawley, wife of Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. They contend that the FDA violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a law governing how agencies operate, when it expanded access to the purportedly \u201chigh risk\u201d drug in 2016 and 2021. The changes in 2016 followed a \u201cpiecemeal analysis\u201d of insufficient data, the Alliance writes, and the action of 2021 relied on \u201cunreliable\u201d information. Lifting \u201clong-existing and common-sense safety standards\u201d was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and thus \u201cunreasonable\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The federal government and Danco, which markets mifepristone as Mifeprex, paint the FDA\u2019s decisions in a rosier light. The move in 2016 was based on \u201can enormous and highly reliable data set\u201d, the government says. The decision to allow pills-by-post in 2021 was informed by \u201cextensive published literature\u201d, plus more than two decades of women safely using mifepristone. Emergencies arise in at most 0.7% of cases, making the medicine safer than Viagra or penicillin."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The two sides will surely debate the wisdom of the FDA\u2019s moves in next week\u2019s oral argument. But the question of standing could dominate the conversation: whether the challengers have the legal right to bring the case. The Supreme Court has held that fierce opposition to a policy is no grounds to sue the government. Litigants must show they have suffered a \u201cconcrete injury\u201d with a clear causal link. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The plaintiffs advance a host of arguments to claim standing. Their main contention is reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: pro-life doctors could be forced to violate their conscience if no one else is available to complete terminations for women rushed to the emergency room after complications from a medical abortion prescribed elsewhere. This \u201clong chain of contingencies\u201d stemming from \u201can exceedingly rare serious adverse event\u201d is purely speculative, the government argues: the plaintiffs have not named \u201ceven a single doctor among their thousands of members who has ever been required to perform an abortion in the decades mifepristone has been on the market\u201d.
