This is the life behind a story.\u201d So begins \u201cOne Way Back\u201d by Christine Blasey Ford, who became a global story herself in 2018, after she accused Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, of assaulting her when they were teenagers. Her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee was watched by around 20m Americans on television, as was Mr Kavanaugh\u2019s energetic and red-faced denial. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed to the Supreme Court in a vote along party lines. But many women were inspired by Ms Blasey Ford\u2019s courage to come forward. She received more than 100,000 letters of support from 42 countries and all 50 states, with about a quarter of them sharing personal experiences of sexual assault. These correspondents inspired her to pen her full account, which is dedicated to them: \u201cThank you. I\u2019m finally writing you back.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Given a years-long smear campaign that included doxxing and death threats\u2014requiring her to spend a small fortune on private security\u2014Ms Blasey Ford\u2019s decision to re-emerge publicly may be surprising. Though her book does not provide dramatic new revelations, it shows the cost of stepping forward. Her message is that, contrary to accusations by some Republicans, her testimony was not a politically motivated \u201clast-minute effort to block Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indeed, the process was protracted and messy. She agonised over how to reveal the assault she recalled occurring when she was 15 at a home in the posh suburbs of Washington, DC. She, like Mr Kavanaugh, was a \u201cBeltway baby\u201d raised in mainly Republican circles, when she found herself trapped in a bedroom at a party. Even former President Donald Trump initially called her a credible witness and \u201cvery fine woman\u201d after she described her memory of Mr Kavanaugh, then 17 and drunk, trying to undress her and covering her mouth so she would not scream."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University in California, first realised that her \u201cattacker\u201d was a powerful judge in 2004, when then-President George W. Bush attended his wedding. But not until Mr Kavanaugh\u2019s name appeared on a shortlist for the Supreme Court did she feel it her \u201ccivic duty\u201d to step forward. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Determined to go it alone, Ms Blasey Ford comes across as naive and out of her depth. At first she refused legal help and believed she could remain anonymous. \u201cNever in a million years did I think my face would publicly accompany the allegations,\u201d she writes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "However, her name was leaked, possibly by a senator, and then she came under pressure to testify. History might have been different had she heeded advice from contacts in Silicon Valley to hire a top Republican lawyer and act more assertively. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Written earlier, the book would have been a diatribe against \u201cthe machine [that] would stop at nothing to rehabilitate Kavanaugh\u201d. Instead her memoir is honest and often wry. Readers learn that the unassuming professor once dyed her hair partially blue and was pulled from the brink of despair by an invitation to meet her favourite band, Metallica, backstage."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cOne Way Back\u201d feels like a missive from a time long past. In the five years since Ms Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony, the chorus of #MeToo, in which women came forward and publicly identified men who they said had abused them, has faded. Now a rollback of reproductive rights has been enabled by a conservative Supreme Court majority, which Mr Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment helped to cement."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Blasey Ford has many regrets about how her testimony unfolded. But she would do it again, \u201cabsolutely\u201d. She surfs, a sport that gives her ordeal and the book its (clich\u00e9d) metaphor. The book is not ghostwritten or slick, and is occasionally awkward and out of order, but Ms Blasey Ford is \u201criding the wave back\u201d with her head held high. Her tone is one of disgusted resignation. \u201cIt felt like I had been believed,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut then the response was a proverbial shrug.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": " For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 68}
