Marshall\u2019s contention that economics studies the \u201cordinary\u201d was not a dig, but a statement of intent. The discipline was to take seriously some of the most urgent questions in human life. How do I pay my bills? What do I do for a living? What happens if I get sick? Will I ever be able to retire? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2003 the New York Times published a profile of Steven Levitt, an economist at the University of Chicago, in which he expressed a very different perspective: \u201cIn Levitt\u2019s view,\u201d the article read, \u201ceconomics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions.\u201d Mr Levitt and the article\u2019s author, Stephen Dubner, would go on to write \u201cFreakonomics\u201d together. In their book there was little about the ordinary business of life. Through vignettes featuring cheating sumo wrestlers, minimum-wage-earning crack dealers and the Ku Klux Klan, a white-supremacist organisation, the authors explored how people respond to incentives and how the use of novel data can uncover what is really driving their behaviour. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Freakonomics was a hit. It ranked just below Harry Potter in the bestseller lists. Much like Marvel comics, it spawned an expanded universe: New York Times columns, podcasts and sequels, as well as imitators and critics, determined to tear down its arguments. It was at the apex of a wave of books that promised a quirky\u2014yet rigorous\u2014analysis of things that the conventional wisdom had missed. On March 7th Mr Levitt, who for many people became the image of an economist, announced his retirement from academia. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong place for me to be,\u201d he said. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "During his academic career, Mr Levitt wrote papers in applied microeconomics. He was, in his own self-effacing words, \u201ca footnote to the \u2018credibility revolution\u2019\u201d. This refers to the use of statistical tricks, such as instrumental-variable analysis, natural experiments and regression discontinuity, which are designed to tease out causal relationships from data. He popularised the techniques of economists including David Card, Guido Imbens and Joshua Angrist, who together won the economics Nobel prize in 2021. The idea was to exploit quirks in the data to simulate the randomness that actual scientists find in controlled experiments. Arbitrary start dates for school terms could, for instance, be employed to estimate the effect of an extra year of education on wages."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Where the Freakonomics approach differed was to apply these techniques to \u201cthe hidden side of everything\u201d, as the book\u2019s tagline put it. Mr Levitt\u2019s work focused on crime, education and racial discrimination. The book\u2019s most controversial chapter argued that America\u2019s nationwide legalisation of abortion in 1973 had led to a fall in crime in the 1990s, because more unwanted babies were aborted before they could grow into delinquent teenagers. It was a classic of the clever-dick genre: an unflinching social scientist using data to come to a counterintuitive conclusion, and not shying away from offence. It was, however, wrong. Later researchers found a coding error and pointed out that Mr Levitt had used the total number of arrests, which depends on the size of a population, and not the arrest rate, which does not. Others pointed out that the fall in homicide started among women. No-fault divorce, rather than legalised abortion, may have played a bigger role."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other economists, including James Heckman, Mr Levitt\u2019s colleague in Chicago and another Nobel prizewinner, worried about trivialisation. \u201cCute\u201d, was how he described the approach in one interview. Take a paper on discrimination in the \u201cThe Weakest Link\u201d, a game show in which contestants vote to remove other contestants depending on whether they think they are costing them money by getting questions wrong (in the early portion of the game) or are competition for the prize pool by getting them right (later on). That provided a setting in which Mr Levitt could look at how observations of others\u2019 competence interacted with racism and sexism. A cunning design\u2014but perhaps of limited relevance in understanding broader economic outcomes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the heart of Mr Heckman\u2019s critique was the idea that practitioners of such studies were focusing on \u201cinternal validity\u201d (ensuring estimates of the effect of some change were correctly estimated) over \u201cexternal validity\u201d (whether the estimates would apply more generally). Mr Heckman instead thought that economists should create structural models of decision-making and use data to estimate the parameters that explained behaviour within them. The debate turned toxic. According to Mr Levitt, Mr Heckman went so far as to assign graduate students the task of tearing apart the Freakonomics author\u2019s work for their final exam. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Did you know..."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Neither man won. The credibility revolution ate its own children: subsequent papers often overturned results, even if, as in the case of those popularised by Freakonomics, they had an afterlife as cocktail-party anecdotes. The problem has spread to the rest of the profession, too. A recent study by economists at the Federal Reserve found that less than half of the published papers they examined could be replicated, even when given help from the original authors. Mr Levitt\u2019s counterintuitive results have fallen out of fashion and economists in general have become more sceptical. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Mr Heckman\u2019s favoured approaches have problems of their own. Structural models require assumptions that can be as implausible as any quirky quasi-experiment. Sadly, much contemporary research uses vast amounts of data and the techniques of the \u201ccredibility revolution\u201d to come to obvious conclusions. The centuries-old questions of economics are as interesting as they always were. The tools to investigate them remain a work in progress. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Free exchange, our column on economics:How NIMBYs increase carbon emissions (Mar 14th)An economist\u2019s guide to the luxury-handbag market (Mar 7th)What do you do with 191bn frozen euros owned by Russia?
