She chats with her father\u2019s embalmed corpse. In Kate Winslet\u2019s star turn, her lisping petulance recalls Veruca Salt, the spoiled brat in \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d. Elena\u2019s antics, amours and annexations are chronicled in \u201cThe Regime\u201d, a satiricaldrama out now in America and in Britain soon. It is a silly TV show that makes serious points about autocracy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Elena and her country are sly composites of real people and places. There are echoes of communist Romania under the doomed Ceausescus and of the failed Soviet coup of 1991, when state tv broadcast \u201cSwan Lake\u201d (here it is \u201cThe Barber of Seville\u201d). Elena\u2019s ceremonial braided hairstyle evokes Yulia Tymoshenko, a Ukrainian firebrand. But the main influence is Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. The action begins with the arrival in the palace of a rough-hewn corporal, Herbert Zubak (Matthias Schoenaerts)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Because of his role in a massacre, which nobody lets him forget, his nickname is \u201cthe Butcher\u201d. This is the show\u2019s first insight: Herbert is promoted not in spite of his disgrace but because of it. Elena, like other autocrats, knows compromised people are pliable. Systems like hers rely on mutual blackmail, whereby every courtier has dirt on all the others; an honest person is useless. If blood is shed, many hands are dipped in it, as when Russian bigwigs appear with Mr Putin in his televised warmongering. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Next, consider that portable oxygen chamber. Elena\u2019s hypochondria\u2014she has a horror of spores\u2014spoofs germophobe leaders who are fanatical about their own welfare yet neglect their citizens\u2019. But her quirks are also exertions of power. If she says noxious spores pervade her palace, they do. Everyone applauds her atrocious singing, just as Mr Putin\u2019s lickspittles let him win at ice hockey."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The goal is not to make anyone believe in such fantasies and lies: it is to force underlings to swallow them, so underlining the autocrat\u2019s power. You are not meant to believe the Kremlin\u2019s denial that it killed Alexei Navalny in Russia\u2019s gulag. If you did, the murder\u2019s intimidating message would be blunted. The aim is to add intellectual insult to lethal injury. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Elena speaks to her subjects in televised addresses, calling them \u201cmy loves\u201d. As autocrats do, she claims to have a mystical connection to the people, wielding them in arguments like a mace. In truth, she despises them as grubby bumpkins and loathes meeting them. She frets over their loyalty, as rulers tend to when normal debate is stifled. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThey love to see America punched in the mouth,\u201d an apparatchik says of his compatriots. As in many smallish countries, Elena oscillates between courting and resenting American involvement. She tries to play Washington off against Beijing and launches half-baked bids for autarky. Yet even as she denounces America she enjoys its pop culture, watching \u201cFriends\u201d over dinner, rather as Bashar Assad clung to his iTunes account as Syria imploded. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Apart from bashing the West, in a fix Elena deploys two go-to autocratic tactics. She trumpets a crackdown on corruption (notwithstanding her own offshore stash) and seizes a slice of adjacent territory in what is not, repeat not, an invasion. The ensuing sanctions mean a disgruntled insider can no longer visit his pied-\u00e0-terre in Miami. As circumstances deteriorate, the cronies must calculate when to run, a dilemma familiar to henchmen from Cairo to Caracas."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Artistically, the show has flaws. It tries vainly to make you care about its characters even as it sends them up. The waspish dialogue is not as funny as the invective in \u201cSuccession\u201d. But, autocratically, it hits the mark\u2014above all in capturing the way this sort of power is itself a kind of twisted performance."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cCould it just be theatre?\u201d that insider wonders when an oligarch is publicly humiliated. In regimes like this, however, theatre is the basic mode of statecraft. It isn\u2019t only that \u201cthe visuals\u201d matter more than the substance of events. The autocrat substitutes ritual and spectacle for political competition (as in Russia\u2019s farcical election). Politics is a pastiche of democracy, a satirical pantomime in which all are dragooned into the joke. An autocracy, in other words, is often a silly show with a tragically serious point.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:Infatuation, kids, adultery: marriage is the theme of the Oscars (Mar 7th)\u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray\u201d points to the future of theatre (Feb 29th)The real message of Vladimir Putin\u2019s chat with Tucker Carlson (Feb 9th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Back Story column got its name."}], "id": 71}
