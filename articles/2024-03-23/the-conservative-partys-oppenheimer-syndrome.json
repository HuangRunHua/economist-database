Cillian Murphy plays the titular American scientist who builds the atom bomb that will end the second world war. Then the Soviets get its secrets. An arms race begins; he is tortured by visions of missiles streaking through the sky. \u201cHe talks about putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle,\u201d scoffs a rival. The prospect of Armageddon can make you question your career decisions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In recent years Tory ministers have been conducting their own experiment with the nuclear physics of the British constitution. The cognoscenti call it a restorationist agenda that asserts the primacy of a sovereign Parliament over subordinate institutions, and of elected politicians over unelected officialdom. To less sophisticated folk it has looked more like ministers hoovering up powers they don\u2019t know how to use and sidelining any practices that inconvenienced them. Either way, Conservatives have put surprisingly little thought into the consequence of this unshackled state falling into the hands of their opponents. A Labour Party that is inimical to much of what the Tories hold dear is on course for a parliamentary majority in a system where the institutional and cultural checks on executive power have been weakened. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s leader, is an institutionalist, who loathed Boris Johnson\u2019s disregard for norms and promises to put officials back on their pedestals. Yet he is also an instrumentalist, who has employed every clause of the Labour rule book and every chapter of parliamentary procedure to bring his party to the brink of power. He wants to do things by the book, but the book is also there to be used. Sir Keir thinks the state is siloed and drifting; he wants to get it moving to revive the economy and restore public services. As his chief of staff, he has hired Sue Gray, a former mandarin who is temperamentally averse to constraining Whitehall. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the government\u2019s hands a statement of the constitutionally obvious\u2014that Parliament is sovereign to legislate as it wishes\u2014has been used as a pretext to do whatever is politically convenient. Should Labour secure a large majority, as its poll lead suggests it might, that stance will look less smart. Sir Keir\u2019s office has vetted its candidates far more rigorously than Sir Tony Blair\u2019s did before his landslide win in 1997, so that they can be relied on to pass his legislative programme. Sir Keir does not have much appetite to end the Commons\u2019 dominance: a proposal for an elected second chamber, which would act as a stronger check than the House of Lords, has been kicked into the long grass. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not that MPs will always be needed to get things done. Sir Keir told business leaders recently that he would crack on with planning reform without legislation: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get bogged down. We\u2019ve got to get on with it from day one.\u201d Handily, over the past decade the statute book has been laced with powers that allow ministers to devise regulatory codes or amend existing legislation with little parliamentary oversight. Take the Retained EU Law Act, which allows sweeping amendments to old EU law on the strikingly broad grounds of \u201cchanges in technology\u201d or \u201cdevelopments in scientific understanding\u201d. Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, warns that Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, wants to heap red tape on enterprise; doing so has never been easier. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Free-market Eurosceptics have little to show for breaking off the EU\u2019s legal girdle. But Brexit has enabled Sir Keir to make one of his most popular policy proposals: levying value-added tax on private schools, which many Tories regard as vandalism and which was impossible under the bloc\u2019s tax rules. If Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, can find the money for her dirigiste vision, she will have greater freedom to spend it; that is because Mr Johnson loosened the old EU subsidy-control rules, which had been pushed for by Margaret Thatcher to make Europe more competitive. (Some on the Conservative right also now question the wisdom of a new ministerial definition of \u201cextremist\u201d, since Labour\u2019s idea of \u201cextreme\u201d may differ from their own.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "When a government has a strong majority and interventionist instincts, the courts become a more important check. But the senior judiciary has given the executive more leeway since clashes between the government and the Supreme Court during the years of Brexit fighting. Analysis by Lewis Graham of the University of Oxford finds that the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of public bodies more often since the presidency of Lord Reed began in 2020. Sir Keir will further this trend: he promises to reduce the grounds for time-sapping judicial reviews that hold up big infrastructure projects. Rural Tory MPs who like executive power in theory will not welcome this.

Indeed, a Labour government can produce hysterics. Winston Churchill claimed that Clement Attlee, his wartime coalition partner, would create a Gestapo. The tenure of James Callaghan, the mild-mannered head of a weak government, prompted Lord Hailsham to declare that British democracy was nothing more than an \u201celective dictatorship\u201d, checked only by the consciences of its members and Commons procedure."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The principal check on the Tory government has been its own dysfunction: it has been too divided to put the powers it accumulated to effective use. For a new Labour government, the main restraint would be ministers\u2019 willingness not to abuse the system they inherit. But these are politicians, not monks. At the end of the film, Oppenheimer is asked when he got moral qualms about his project. \u201cWhen it became clear to me that we would tend to use any weapon we had.\u201d In politics, as in physics, self-restraint is rarely enough.
