Mechanics work beneath battered Mercedes; doughy cooks prepare doughy strudel; a guesthouse is named after a Bavarian prince. In the centre of town the privately run Swakopmund Museum is a mix of taxidermy and Germany. Near a stuffed seal is a cabinet of pilsner glasses used by those who left the Second Reich for German South-West Africa, as Namibia was known between 1884 to 1915. The museum\u2019s curator concedes that it \u201cdoes not tell the whole story\u201d and cites a lack of funds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To grasp a fuller account of German colonialism, travel to the town\u2019s outskirts.

From 1904 to 1908 around 65,000 Herero people (80% of the total) and 10,000 Nama (50%) were killed as part of a brutal German response to a rebellion. The methods foreshadowed and inspired the Nazis. (The brown shirts worn by the Nazi Party\u2019s paramilitary Sturmabteilung came from a surplus supply of colonial uniforms.) Thousands were crammed into concentration camps. Their skulls were sent to Germany for examination by eugenicist scientists.

Like neighbouring South Africa, from which the country seceded in 1990, Namibia is run by a party, SWAPO, whose legitimacy stems from its opposition to white rule. School textbooks make little mention of the genocide, lest it complicate the narrative that only they, SWAPO, resisted the whites. Ovambo, Namibia\u2019s largest group, dominate SWAPO; Herero and Nama remain marginalised."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second target is recalcitrants in Swakopmund itself.
