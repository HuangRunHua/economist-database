First, Mr Lighthizer slays a straw man. The economic case against tariff increases is that they worsen the economy\u2019s performance and not, as he claims, that they \u201cdestroy capitalism\u201d. The survival of America\u2019s market-oriented economy in the wake of Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs, therefore, does nothing to discredit the case for free trade."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Second, Mr Lighthizer insists that the past several decades have left America in dire need of \u201creindustrialisation\u201d. In fact, industrial output in America rose rather steadily from the end of the second world war until the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, and then slowly rose again until the pandemic, after which it once again increased. It hit its all-time high in September 2018 and is today only 1.5% below that record level. As for America\u2019s industrial capacity, today it is a mere 0.4% below the historic peak it reached in December 2016, the month before Mr Trump took office."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Third, it is simply untrue that increases in a country\u2019s imports to match any increases in its exports is \u201chow trade is supposed to work\u201d.

But it can also work when a country uses its export earnings, not to import more, but to invest abroad, thus potentially increasing the amount of capital available in destination countries. This has happened in America in every year since 1975, when it last ran a trade surplus."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Phil GrammNon-resident senior fellow at the American Enterprise InstituteHelotes, Texas"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Donald BoudreauxMercatus CentreGeorge Mason UniversityFairfax, Virginia"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240224_WBD000.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "second", "text": "Education and social justice"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Schumpeter wrote about how universities are \u201ctorn between their responsibilities to learning and social justice\u201d (February 24th). This tension underlies the crisis in higher education. Learning and knowledge have been central to universities since the Middle Ages, but the idea that they have a mission to further social justice is new and it is a misunderstanding. Although the definition of knowledge (justified true belief) has remained remarkably constant and is not political, interpretations of what constitutes justice vary widely and are fundamentally political and cultural.

The average tenure of a Fortune 500 chief executive is seven years, according to Spencer Stuart, a consulting firm, so the average tenure of a university president of six years doesn\u2019t look too surprising.
