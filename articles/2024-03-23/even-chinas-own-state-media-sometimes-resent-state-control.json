It happens to foreign journalists all the time. But many were stunned this month when reporters from China Central Television (CCTV), the country\u2019s leading state-run broadcaster, got the same treatment. Even the anchor of a live telecast could not hide her on-air surprise when colleagues reporting from the site of a deadly explosion were shoved away."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The blast occurred at rush hour on the morning of March 13th in Yanjiao, a commuter town just a few kilometres beyond the boundary of Beijing, China\u2019s capital. Seven people were killed and 27 injured. The incident highlighted long-simmering questions about the regime\u2019s control of news."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In another incident a reporter for China Media Group, CCTV\u2019s parent company, posted a video online of her team\u2019s similarly rough handling by police at the scene. Pointed commentary came quickly, as it often does around controversial events, on social media. The mighty party-controlled media, wrote one user, \u201calso gets a taste of the iron fist of socialism\u201d. Now, wrote another, CCTV journalists are enjoying the same treatment as foreign media."}, {"role": "body", "text": "More unusual was a sharp statement on the night of the explosion by the All-China Journalists\u2019 Association, normally a docile party-controlled lot. \u201cLegitimate news-gathering is a journalist\u2019s right,\u201d said the group. The authorities must not \u201ccrudely obstruct journalists from conducting their work in a normal manner in order to control public sentiment\u201d. Objective reports, the association said, can help \u201calleviate public anxiety\u201d and \u201cprotect the people\u2019s right to know\u201d.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "CCTV staffers say state control over their work has tightened in recent years. It is rarely as visible as it was in Yanjiao. But reporters have long had to get advance approval before reporting at any site and are strictly supervised by censors in choosing topics and deciding whom to interview."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Local officials apologised a day later for their treatment of the journalists in Yanjiao. A week after the explosion, the site remained full of emergency vehicles and roped off behind police cordons. Local residents still grumbled about remaining in the dark over the disaster\u2019s true cause. In polite but very firm fashion, police insisted that your correspondent must not take photographs.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 19}
