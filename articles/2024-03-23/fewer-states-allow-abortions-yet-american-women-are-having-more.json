This included putting up billboards in Arizona and Texas and opening clinics in underserved pockets of the city.

This is astonishing, given that the procedure is now banned in 14 states and has become restricted in several more.

More surprising is the growth among residents of abortion-supporting states. In California locals had an estimated 21,470 more abortions in 2023 than in 2020 (accounting for 88% of the state\u2019s increase) and in New York they had 20,460 more (97%).
