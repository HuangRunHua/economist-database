That his noble deeds were scripted and fictitious never dimmed the passion of his millions of fans."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since his demise, much has changed in Tamil Nadu. The state grew much richer after India\u2019s economic liberalisation in the 1990s. Its 77m people are now among the best-educated in the country. But some things have stayed the same. Cinema is still a finishing school for politics."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kollywood, the Tamil movie industry, named after Kodambakkam, an area in Chennai, the state capital, produces around 150 films a year. That is less than the 200 made by Bollywood, its Hindi rival. But in many ways movies matter more in Tamil Nadu. The state has 5% of India\u2019s population but 12% of its screens. Ticket prices are capped, making them among the cheapest in India. And in all but five years since 1967, the state\u2019s chief minister has had Kollywood roots.

Serious fans often join a rasigar mandram (fan society), which can be an informal group (usually of men) from the same street or a big, well-organised outfit. By some estimates there are thousands of fan clubs.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Dravidian movement gave birth to a political party, the Dravidian Progressive Federation (DMK). Whereas the Congress party, the first rulers of the state (and post-colonial India itself), saw cinema as a source of moral corruption, the DMK embraced it. As a result, Tamil films in the 1950s and 60s were unashamedly political, anti-Brahmin and anti-Hindi. In 1967 the DMK, aided by MGR and his fans, booted Congress out of power in Tamil Nadu. It has struggled in the state ever since. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Five years later MGR fell out with party leaders and broke away to form his own party, the All-India Anna Dravidian Progressive Federation. His fans followed him.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "MGR\u2019s electoral success was built on a carefully cultivated image, writes M.S.S. Pandian, a biographer. He always played a good guy with no vices. Not once in a film was he even seen drinking or smoking. In keeping with his on-screen persona as a champion of the poor, he started welfare programmes and plastered his photos on them. To hide his balding dome and drooping eyes, he wore a fur hat and sunglasses in public.

Hit after hit has featured messages that could have come straight out of a political manifesto. In \u201cSivaji\u201d, released in 2008, Rajinikanth roots out black money in the state, and then India. A decade later in \u201cKaala\u201d he plays a morally scrupulous gangster who thwarts a corrupt politician\u2019s plans to demolish a slum."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, emerging forces could erode the relationship between cinema and politics.

Persuading them you can give them that is hard, if you are an actor with no political track record.
