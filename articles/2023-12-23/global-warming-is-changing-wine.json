The county that (fairly or not) has long signified brash, nouveau riche English culture is home to one of the world\u2019s most exciting new wine producers. Danbury Ridge is earning rave reviews for its ripe, dense, still wine in a country that for centuries was too chilly to muster any bottles of such quality.

Extreme weather is already reducing output: global wine production in 2023 is expected to be the lowest in 62 years. Surviving further warming will require both discovering new sites like Danbury Ridge, and changing planting and farming practices in existing vineyards. Winemakers in the New World have long turned to science to catch up with methods that European producers had perfected via centuries of trial and error. Now the climate is forcing those incumbents to change their time-honoured ways."}, {"role": "body", "text": "First domesticated some 8,000 years ago in Georgia, the grapevine is versatile yet finicky. It can bear quality fruit in climates ranging from Tahiti\u2019s to Norway\u2019s. Scientists seeking to understand why the world\u2019s finest grapes grow where they do have identified a few attributes that such areas share. The most important is temperature: daily averages during the growing season cluster between 12\u00b0C and 22\u00b0C. Precipitation tends to be moderate, and sunlight abundant."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Within these limits, certain varieties prefer narrower temperature bands. Growers strive to synchronise two aspects of the red grape: the accumulation of sugar and the development of \u201cphenolic\u201d compounds in the skin such as tannins and anthocyanins, which give red wine its colour, texture and many of its aromas. As vines absorb sunlight and heat, the amount of sugar they contain\u2014and thus their alcoholic potential\u2014rises, while their levels of methoxypyrazines (which smell like green bell peppers) and acids decline. The speed of this process differs vastly between varieties: planted side by side, early-ripening grapes, like Pinot Noir, attain a given level of sugar as much as two months before late-ripening ones, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, do. Meanwhile, phenolic compounds need time to ripen steadily in the skins, aided by a delicate balance of sunlight and cool nights. Otherwise wines end up tasting bitter and astringent."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Grapes picked with insufficient sugar yield sour, leafy-smelling wines deficient in alcohol. Excessive sugar yields boozy, syrupy beverages with prune or raisin flavours. Kees van Leeuwen, a professor at Bordeaux Sciences Agro and one of the world\u2019s leading wine scientists, explains that to get the right amount of sugar just when grapes achieve phenolic ripeness, growers use varieties that they can harvest near the start of autumn. For warm regions like Napa, this means late-ripening grapes; for cooler ones such as Oregon, early-ripening ones. White wines are made without grape skins but still follow a similar pattern: those grown in the warmest regions tend to lack aromatic complexity; varieties like Riesling achieve their full potential mainly in chilly places like Germany."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The other main geographic factor shaping the character of wine is soil. The principal role of soil is to provide water, and secondarily nutrients\u2014not too little, but definitely not too much. Vines with abundant water tend to focus on growing leaves and new shoots, and form large berries that yield wines lacking concentration. In contrast, those suffering \u201cmoderate water deficit\u201d dedicate what little vigour they have to their fruit, producing berries full of phenolic compounds and the potential for aromatic complexity. Great wine grapes can be grown on a wide variety of soil types, ranging from clay to sand to gravel, so long as they provide a constrained, steady water supply."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But even the best soil cannot compensate for poor weather. And for many years much of Europe was too cold to produce great wine. Famous French vintages like 1945, 1961 and 1990 were unusually hot and dry, yielding fully ripe grapes with above-average alcohol levels. Wines from years in between were frequently thin, herbaceous and unsuitable for long-term ageing."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As is typical for high latitudes, Europe has warmed unusually fast. In most of its wine regions average temperatures during the growing season have risen by a full 2\u00b0C since 1950. As a result, grapes\u2019 ripening cycle has accelerated. In the Alsace region of France, the typical date of veraison\u2014the point at which grape skins change from green to yellow or purple\u2014is now 39 days earlier than the long-run historical average. One response is to pick grapes sooner. A database from Beaune, Burgundy, going back to 1354 showed that harvest dates since 1988 were on average 13 days earlier than the previous baseline. Nonetheless, sugar concentrations are creeping up: the typical level at harvest in Bordeaux rose by about 20% from 1978 to 2005."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/interactive/christmas-specials/2023/12/20/global-warming-is-changing-wine/_app/immutable/assets/wine1-Artboard_1_copy_4.4ba45b2f.png", "imageWidth": 1400, "imageHeight": 796}, {"role": "body", "text": "In theory, the welcome disappearance of years that are too cold or wet should be offset by the advent of vintages that are too hot or dry. One widely cited paper from 2005 calculated that the optimal average growing-season temperature for Bordeaux was 17.3\u00b0C, a threshold surpassed more than a decade ago. In Burgundy, all 11 of the warmest years since 1979 have occurred since 2003. Yet it turns out that grapevines have surprisingly robust defences against such conditions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Generally as temperatures rise, photosynthesis and the accumulation of sugar accelerate. But once the air gets above a certain temperature\u2014approaching 40\u00b0C\u2014vines partly shut down, and ripening slows until the heat abates. So long as grapes do not suffer severe sunburn, record-hot summers like 2022 can still deliver balanced wines. \u201cThe level of stress the vineyards had to put up with was unprecedented,\u201d says Gaia Gaja, a leading Italian producer. She says the plants resembled bonsai for lack of water. \u201cBut they made it.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, frequent bouts of extreme weather are testing the limits of such resilience. Warmer winters make buds break earlier in spring, after which vines are vulnerable to frosts. France suffered a late frost in 2017 and a dire one in 2021, which cut Burgundy\u2019s yields in half. Mild temperatures also help pests like the grapevine moth, which gobbles up berries\u2019 innards, to survive winter. In Italy torrential rains this May enabled downy mildew disease to ravage grapes in the east and south. Drought in Spain in 2023 has cut yields by 14%."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Will growing conditions reminiscent of the ten plagues become the new normal? In 2022 a group of scientists led by Giovanni Sgubin of the University of Palermo built a statistical model to estimate the suitability of a given location for numerous grape varieties based on factors such as temperature, precipitation and humidity, and then applied it to all of Europe for a range of climate trajectories. They found that existing wine regions would cope fairly well up to about a 2\u00b0C increase in global temperatures, roughly twice the warming seen since 1880. Beyond that threshold, however, the share of current area under vines expected to stop producing wine-worthy fruit would soar. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that things will creep up on us and fruit quality will deteriorate, and we\u2019ll wake up one morning and say, \u2018God, the wine sucks,\u2019\u201d says Gregory Gambetta, an author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019ll be some event that\u2019s so extreme that you wake up and all the wine is gone.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/interactive/christmas-specials/2023/12/20/global-warming-is-changing-wine/_app/immutable/assets/wine2-Artboard_1_copy_4.b05b9dd2.png", "imageWidth": 1400, "imageHeight": 838}, {"role": "body", "text": "In response, some regions and producers are breaking long-standing norms.

Simple changes in farming techniques\u2014like lengthening vines\u2019 trunks, increasing the space between vine rows or reviving an old Mediterranean practice of shortening vines called \u201cgoblet pruning\u201d\u2014can delay ripening or improve resistance to drought. Shade cloths can protect grapes from sunburn and shrinkage. Irrigation would help as well, but it is (still, for now) generally prohibited for fine European wines.

The sunniest part of Essex, one of England\u2019s warmest and driest regions, is the Dengie Peninsula, where the wide estuaries of the Crouch and Blackwater rivers limit cloud formation. To guide his search for vineyard sites in this area, John Atkinson, a viticulturist for Danbury Ridge, hunted for a clay mineral called smectite, which predominates at hallowed Bordeaux producers. It has optimal water-buffering qualities, storing small amounts of water in thin sheets between its microscopic layers. During downpours, it swells and becomes impermeable, whereas in droughts, it shrinks and forms cracks, letting roots probe for the last drops."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Atkinson eventually discovered that the parts of southern England with the highest proportions of smectite clay happened to be in or near Danbury Rid\u00adge\u2019s own Crouch Valley.
