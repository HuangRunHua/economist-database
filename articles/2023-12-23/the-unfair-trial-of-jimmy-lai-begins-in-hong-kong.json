But as Mr Lai stood in court on December 18th, facing charges of sedition and colluding with foreign forces, it felt like the culmination of a much longer saga. The pro-democracy media tycoon has spent decades challenging the administration in Hong Kong and the national government in Beijing. They, in turn, consider Mr Lai a traitor and have been relishing the chance for more payback."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Revered by many Hong Kongers for his bravery, Mr Lai has led a rags-to-riches life. At the age of 12 he escaped Mao Zedong\u2019s China by stowing away on a boat. Once in Hong Kong he worked his way up from factory dogsbody to clothing impresario and media mogul. The government in Beijing forced him out of the garment industry in 1994 after he wrote a column in one of his magazines calling Li Peng, China\u2019s prime minister at the time, \u201cthe son of a turtle\u2019s egg\u201d (a rather nasty insult)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1995 Mr Lai founded Apple Daily, a popular tabloid that mixed tittle-tattle with criticism of the government. By 2021 the authorities in Hong Kong had had enough. Acting under the national-security law, they froze the paper\u2019s assets, raided its offices and arrested several of its leaders. (People across Hong Kong queued to buy the paper\u2019s farewell edition.) The charges against Mr Lai are based in part on articles in Apple Daily that called for international sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials. Prosecutors argue that this amounted to collusion with foreign forces. Six of the paper\u2019s former staff members pleaded guilty to the charge in 2022."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government in Hong Kong has gone to great lengths to ensure that Mr Lai\u2019s trial goes its way. It prevented him from appointing his preferred barrister, a Briton named Tim Owen. (The fight over that contributed to the trial\u2019s being delayed for months.) Paul Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s justice minister, insisted that Mr Lai be tried not by a jury, but by three judges approved by John Lee, the city\u2019s chief executive (this is now the norm in national-security cases). Chris Tang, the security minister, has already proclaimed that the proceedings will prove Mr Lai is \u201cbad\u201d. The government likes to boast that it has a 100% conviction rate in national-security trials."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2022 Mr Lai was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison for fraud, a verdict denounced by human-rights groups. Now he looks set to spend the rest of his life behind bars. America, Britain and the European Union have condemned the trial. Mr Lai\u2019s legal team hopes this will help. But the defendant is said to be reconciled to his fate. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 13}
