His flagship project to do so is a 1,500km (970-mile) tourist railway, known as the Tren Maya, connecting towns, beach resorts and ruins around the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, which the president inaugurated on December 15th.

In Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s haste to finish various mega-projects\u2014a refinery, a new airport in Mexico City and an interoceanic corridor in the south\u2014he often opens them half-finished. For now the train is only operating on the stretch between Campeche and Canc\u00fan, on a limited timetable. The first journey took over nine hours, far longer than by car.
