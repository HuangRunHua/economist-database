Some had signed up voluntarily, thinking they would to be given places in units that suited their profiles: as drone operators or artillery men. Others were plucked from their villages with little warning. One older recruit didn\u2019t even have the chance to pick up his false teeth. After less than a week in the trenches of the Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, the platoon of 20 had been reduced by six. Three had been killed in action, three seriously wounded.

The 3rd Assault Brigade, created nine months into the war as a branch of Ukraine\u2019s special forces, is perhaps the most visible.

The majority of its new recruits are under 25, and she turns down 150 applications a month from minors. \u201cNo one is saying there are millions of people waiting to fight in Avdiivka [a town in the Donbas that has recently seen fierce fighting],\u201d she says. \u201cBut there are people you can work with.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia, too, is having difficulty mobilising the troops it needs. Its tactic of hurling vast numbers of men at defended positions, often without proper equipment, can mean daily losses as high as 1,000 men.
