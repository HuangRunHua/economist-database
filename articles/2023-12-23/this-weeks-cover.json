The first featured the eponymous hero stranded on his island with a bottle of wine and a whale in the distance, visual references to two other pieces in the issue. It was charming, but lacked a sense of seasonality.

The first of these showed the ornament floating in the water, its top emerging as Crusoe\u2019s island and the whale swimming below. The second used just the top of the bauble, bobbing along with Crusoe teetering on its edge. Both were fun, but neither quite worked.

For an article about women finding fame online with their DIY skills Joanne Joo, a Chinese illustrator based in Thailand, produced a set of wonderful illustrations using 3D figures. The cover she designed featured several of the characters our journalists had written about throughout the issue, working together to decorate a log cabin. It had two strengths. First, its visual references to different stories helped convey the extravagance of the issue. Second, its mood of joyful warmth felt appropriate at this time of year.

Donald Trump, a horrifying fairy perched atop the Christmas tree, was not sufficiently recognisable. Nor were Churchill or Crusoe.

And a wall on the left looked sad and blank in contrast to the colourful jumble of the rest of the picture."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231220_OPD006.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The final iteration was better. Churchill was more Churchillian, Crusoe more Crusovian. St Donald had a quiffier quiff. A wine rack and a stack of logs made that back corner feel less empty. A final round of edits fixed the final niggles: the ostracised penguins at the window were brought in from the cold and the shoes made more apparent. The cosy scene was set.
