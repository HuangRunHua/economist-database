One of the reasons for their bust-up with the studios was the use of artificial intelligence (ai) in film and television production.

Work for animal actors is drying up as computer graphics offer an easier\u2014and, some argue, more humane\u2014way to portray creatures on screen. As ai makes those special effects still more realistic and easier to produce, the replacement of real animals with digital ones is accelerating, in television and advertising as well as in high-end movies.

One of the first big roles he landed for Luke was in \u201cA Royal Romance\u201d, a tv movie about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

Earlier this year Tag had to maul a dummy inside a sleeping bag, for an independent movie called \u201cNight of the Grizzly\u201d (Tag is a Kodiak, but he can play a grizzly).

Mr Martin once kept 100 or so animals at his 60-acre ranch, looked after by 15 trainers. Now his staff is down to a core of three, and most of the enclosures on the ranch are empty. Other businesses have closed or radically reduced their stock. Trainers are fewer, too. Moorpark College, on the edge of Los Angeles, has supplied animal wranglers to Hollywood through its Exotic Animal Training Management course since 1974.

Public outcry greeted a cowboy film, \u201cJesse James\u201d, in 1939 in which a horse was deliberately driven off a cliff into a lake, where it drowned. The following year the American Humane Society, a charity, began providing its now-famous certification that \u201cNo animals were harmed\u201d in the making of productions that passed its on-set inspections."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the first time, the hair looked good"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Animals\u2019 treatment in Hollywood has vastly improved since the days of \u201cJesse James\u201d.

For years after that, computer models struggled to create realistic hair, which animals tend to have a lot of. Furry cgi creatures looked weirdly smooth\u2014\u201clike Gummi Bears\u201d, recalls Mr Mui. Then, in 1998, came Disney\u2019s \u201cMighty Joe Young\u201d, whose star is a giant ape created from animatronics and cgi.
