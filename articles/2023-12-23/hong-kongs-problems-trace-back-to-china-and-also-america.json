From its terrace, you can peer over a cocktail and through the office windows of HSBC across the road. The restaurant\u2019s cuisine is meant to be \u201cfresh, simple and honest\u201d. Yet it is not cheap. An oversized dosa, a humble South Indian breakfast food, will set you back HK$380 (almost $50). Some patrons eat them with a knife and fork. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In May, sadly, the restaurant will close. That has not helped the morale of the city\u2019s beleaguered financial industry. Hong Kong\u2019s main stockmarket index has plunged by more than a quarter since late January. Its index for smaller, \u201cgrowth\u201d enterprises is well below the trough it reached in October 2022, before China began lifting the quarantine requirements that starved Hong Kong of visitors.

Mainlanders have described Exchange Square, where the bourse is located, as a \u201cruin\u201d. Unlike New York\u2019s financial district, which features a bronze statue of a charging bull, the square features two bronze water buffalo, one lying flat."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Financial services account for more than a fifth of Hong Kong\u2019s GDP. It is therefore hard for the city to prosper when its bankers do not. In July some forecasters expected Hong Kong\u2019s economy to grow by 6% in 2023. Now the consensus is only 3.3%. That means Hong Kong\u2019s GDP is smaller than it was in 2018, the year before anti-government protests broke out. It amounts to a lost half-decade. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even Hong Kong\u2019s notoriously expensive property market has suffered. Prices have fallen by almost 20% since their peak. In October the city cut in half stamp duty for foreign buyers and buyers of multiple properties. Capital Economics, a research firm, notes that it was the first relaxation of property-buying curbs since 2010. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "What explains Hong Kong\u2019s woes? Sevva\u2019s founder cited the covid-19 pandemic and the \u201csocial movements of 2019\u201d, which \u201cposed enormous challenges\u201d to the restaurant\u2019s operations. In response to protests about the mainland\u2019s growing influence, China\u2019s government imposed a strict national-security law, which has further eroded the city\u2019s autonomy. That has made it harder for Hong Kong to fulfil its coveted role as a \u201csuperconnector\u201d between China and the rest of the world. John Lee, the city\u2019s leader, could not attend the APEC forum in San Francisco in November because he is under American sanctions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since the protests were quashed, the authorities have worked hard to bring Hong Kong and the mainland closer together. Whether or not this message has taken root among residents, it seems to have prevailed among foreign investors, some of whom now see little distinction between Hong Kong and the rest of China. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the truth is that Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry and property market remained strong after the national-security law was introduced in June 2020. IPOs, for example, brought in almost HK$329bn in 2021, 15% more than in 2018. Property prices did not peak until the end of 2021."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s crackdown on Hong Kong has probably done less immediate harm to the territory\u2019s financial markets than another crackdown: Beijing\u2019s regulatory campaign against mainland property developers and internet firms, many of which are listed in Hong Kong. Strict financial limits imposed on developers caused a wave of defaults on bonds issued in Hong Kong. Investors have learnt that unsecured debt issued offshore by a mainland company\u2019s subsidiary or offshoot sinks to the bottom of the pecking order when things go wrong. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As well as diminished autonomy from the mainland, Hong Kong also lacks autonomy from America\u2019s Federal Reserve. To maintain its currency peg to the dollar, the city has been forced to raise interest rates sharply, despite low inflation and the fragility of its recovery. High interest rates have hurt the property market and the broader economy. The high cost of capital may have encouraged firms to run down their inventories, contributing to the sharp slowdown in growth in the second quarter, argues Goldman Sachs, a bank. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The currency peg has also meant that Hong Kong has lost competitiveness against some of its neighbours. Its currency has risen by 6% against the yuan since the end of January, even as prices in China have been falling. Weak exports and strong imports are likely to subtract more than two percentage points from Hong Kong\u2019s growth this year. Hong Kong is not just another Chinese city. If it were, it would have a more competitive currency. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Days of being wild"}, {"role": "body", "text": "When China dismantled its quarantine regime a year ago, Hong Kong\u2019s boutiques, hotels and restaurants expected an influx of mainlanders. In the first ten months of the year, 21m showed up. Yet that was only 52% of the number that arrived in the same period of 2018. These visitors also seem to be spending less. Indeed, many of them are opening bank accounts and buying life-insurance policies to take advantage of the city\u2019s higher interest rates. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Instead of mainlanders flocking to Hong Kong, the city\u2019s residents are travelling in the opposite direction. Their departures (mostly to other parts of China) now outnumber mainland arrivals by almost three-to-one, points out Citigroup, another bank. After a recent visit to Hong Kong, John Greenwood, one of the architects of the territory\u2019s dollar peg, was reminded of \u201cepisodes from the distant past\u201d when British consumers crossed the Channel to France to buy booze and food."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But all this gloom has an upside. If the Fed does cut interest rates in 2024, as futures markets expect, Hong Kong\u2019s domestic economy should respond vigorously. As financial conditions ease and Hong Kong\u2019s currency weakens, the deals and the visitors might return. Although Hong Kong is losing one of its most iconic restaurants, the city\u2019s appeal will endure. It will remain a place where people from around the world can enjoy a taste of Asia without giving up familiar utensils. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 62}
