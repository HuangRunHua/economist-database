"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Professional Darts Corporation (pdc) world darts championship has become an end-of-year institution, a debauched collision of fancy dress and elite sport. For a fortnight each year, a corner of the British capital is transformed into a place where it is always 11.30pm on a Friday night. Inside the venue a confused bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup looks for his seat. Two monks hurry by, carrying eight pints between them. On stage a first-round match between Stowe Buntz, a goateed American, and Kevin Doets, a Dutchman, takes place in front of a semi-oblivious crowd. Before long, a chant begins. Oompa Loompas, nuns and traffic cones stand up, arms wide, and yell: \u201cStand up if you love the darts.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Darts sits squarely in the middle of Britain\u2019s banter-industrial complex\u2014the laddish industries of drinking, gambling and sport that have found a profitable niche and infuse the country\u2019s culture. At \u201cAlly Pally\u201d the darts is a melting pot, albeit still a very male one. \u201cWhere else would a young plumber or banker rub shoulders with. . . Prince Harry?\u201d wonders Barry Hearn, the sports impresario who turned the championships into a juggernaut, in his autobiography. At the darts men from all levels of society rub together\u2014just blokes in fancy dress in a peculiarly long queue for a toilet cubicle, even though urinals are free. Banter is the great leveller. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Hearn likens darts to \u201cworking man\u2019s golf\u201d. Alexandra Palace feels more like a working man\u2019s Wimbledon. Both offer class tourism. At Wimbledon everyone pretends to be posh; at the darts accountants pretend to be massive lads. For strawberries and cream during a fortnight of sport on the telly in the summer, substitute a 29-year-old dressed as a traffic cone during a fortnight of sport on TV in the winter. Each offers the same form of escape. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unlike the tennis, however, this is not an event for purists. Darts is a sport doused in irony and then dipped in lager. It has always had a natural bathos, given that it involves throwing a 20-ish gram dart at a target 237cm away. It manages to be at once difficult, dramatic and fundamentally unimpressive. The sport leans into this contradiction. Each player has a nickname and entry music, aping professional wrestling. \u201cRapid\u201d Ricky Evans, a player built for comfort rather than speed, emerges to the soundtrack of \u201cMerry Christmas Everyone\u201d by Shakin\u2019 Stevens; he wears a shirt with a large cartoon of himself as Santa. The competition is almost incidental. In a queue containing a bearded nun, a pair of Ali Gs and a man dressed as a jockey, the only person to attract strange looks was a man wearing a replica shirt of Joe \u201cThe Rockstar\u201d Cullen, the world number 14.

The eventual winner of the title at Ally Pally will take home \u00a3500,000 ($635,000). The pdc started life as a breakaway organisation in 1992, attracting players who felt underappreciated and, more importantly, underpaid by the more stuffy British Darts Organisation. (The Premier League, England\u2019s top-flight football league and the country\u2019s most successful cultural export, began with a similar logic the same year.) Greed has been good for both sports. The more people pay, the better the contest; the better the contest, the more people will pay. Sky Sports once paid \u00a3100,000 for the rights to televise darts; now it costs them about \u00a310m per year. With an audience of 4.5m last year, Sky Sports\u2019 viewing figures during the tournament will be bettered only by the Premier League. Banter sells.

At 45.1cm in diameter, the board is practically invisible from the back of the hall, never mind the darts themselves. The sport becomes spectacle only on television. In Alexandra Palace the throng watches on big screens, making the venue a bit like the world\u2019s drunkest living room. Without the crowd, however, the show would not work. The organisers know this. When a man dressed as a princess accidentally poured a pint over someone dressed as Toad from Super Mario, the moment was shared by the pdc\u2019s official social-media accounts: \u201cOnly at the darts.\u201d"}, {"role": "second", "text": "The lad economy "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like any canny business, the banter-industrial complex is alive to changing social mores.
