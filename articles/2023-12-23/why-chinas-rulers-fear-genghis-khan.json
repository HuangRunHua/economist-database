To keep power, lots of rulers will crush dissent with an iron fist. A more subtle measure involves thoroughness. Dedicated autocrats use cold, patient repression to bring even the meek and unthreatening into line. Their aim is to snuff out any belief\u2014no matter how harmless\u2014that might divide subjects\u2019 loyalties."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This grim trend may be seen in the Communist Party\u2019s handling of China\u2019s ethnic minorities, a diverse bunch who between them make up around 9% of the overall population. Since Xi Jinping took power in 2012, such groups have lost many of the limited privileges granted to them and faced aggressive campaigns to assimilate into mainstream Chinese culture."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Apologists present Xi-era policies as tough but rational responses to threats. The government\u2019s actions in Xinjiang are indicative. To defend China\u2019s cruelties in the region\u2014including mosque demolitions, re-education campaigns, the jailing of poets and the surveillance of millions of Uyghurs and other minorities\u2014officials play up the dangers of Islamic extremism.

New laws mandating the use of the Chinese language over Mongolian in schools and public institutions aim to \u201csafeguard national sovereignty\u201d. When protests greeted similar changes in 2020, the local government responded by making the rules stricter. Citing Mr Xi\u2019s calls for \u201cethnic solidarity\u201d, the authorities have banned some history books and closed memorials to Genghis Khan, the founder of a dynasty that conquered tracts of Eurasia and ruled China between 1271 and 1368. Defenders of such hardline policies note that Inner Mongolia is a border region, sharing ties of language, religion and history with an independent, democratic country next door, Mongolia. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Revealingly, though, the Xi era has seen moves to smother traditions that pose no conceivable challenge to national security. Chaguan recently travelled to one of the oddest places on China\u2019s ethnic map, the Xingmeng Mongolian Township of Yunnan province. This rural township of about 6,000 people lies in the lush, tobacco-growing hills of southern China near the border with Vietnam\u2014about 2,500km from the grasslands and deserts of Inner Mongolia. Locals claim descent from Mongolian armies, initially led by Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis, that conquered the region in the 13th and 14th centuries. In their telling, some soldiers stayed on after their Mongol overlords were defeated and driven back north by Ming-dynasty emperors. After an early flurry of intermarriage with local women, these \u201cYunnan Mongolians\u201d reputedly settled down as fishermen and carpenters in five villages. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today locals praise their ancestors for stubbornly declining to marry outsiders, thereby\u2014they insist\u2014preserving traces of Mongolian language and dress for over seven centuries. Declaring himself a descendant of Genghis Khan, a village elder admits that he married a woman from China\u2019s Han majority, \u201cso my daughter is only half Mongolian\u201d. To the elder, a longtime party member, his child is fully Mongolian nonetheless, because she \u201cinherited the spirit of the Mongolian nation\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Xingmeng\u2019s history was rediscovered in the 1950s, a time of Sino-Soviet amity, by party officials and ethnographers, as well as by envoys from the Soviet-controlled Mongolian People\u2019s Republic. Alas, as Mao Zedong led China deeper into paranoid isolation, ethnic minorities with ancient traditions and links to foreign lands became the target of attacks. After China broke with the Soviet Union and sank into the frenzies of the Cultural Revolution, terrible violence reached Inner Mongolia. Tens of thousands of ethnic Mongolians were killed, accused of treason and feudal thought. Far to the south in Yunnan, minorities were attacked in a \u201cPolitical Frontier Defence\u201d campaign aimed at border counties. Xingmeng avoided the worst violence, older locals relate, though a temple and ancestral clan halls were damaged. Some temples survived because they had been turned into schools."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After Mao\u2019s death in 1976 Xingmeng enjoyed something of a golden age, as history was harnessed for economic development. Teachers visited from Inner Mongolia to give language lessons at the primary school. Cement replicas of nomads\u2019 tents, horse sculptures and other Mongolian touches appeared. A damaged temple was restored in 1985 as the \u201cThree Saints Temple\u201d, housing statues of Genghis and Kublai, as well as Mongke (Kublai\u2019s brother). A Mongolian folk festival, called Naadam, was held every three years. It began with ceremonies honouring those royal ancestors."}, {"role": "second", "text": "No stately pleasure-domes here"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not this year. No worship of Genghis Khan was allowed as the latest Naadam began in Xingmeng on December 15th (though early that morning some locals quietly slipped into the temple to light incense before the Khans\u2019 impassive statues).

In Xingmeng\u2019s cobbled back alleys, your columnist heard wistfulness and fatalism about the new Naadam, rather than revolt.
