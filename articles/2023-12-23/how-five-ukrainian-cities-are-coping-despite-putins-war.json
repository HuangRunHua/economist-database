Unlike many of his compatriots, he had taken the reports of a Russian build-up seriously. He had four rucksacks lined up by his door in Kharkiv when the first missiles hit: medical kit, laptops, warm clothing. Within an hour Mr Knodt, a tech entrepreneur, was driving south to his native Izyum, a town in the forest he assumed would avoid the invaders\u2019 attention. He was wrong. Two weeks later, as Russian troops were surrounding Izyum, he barely escaped. Activist friends were tortured: teeth beaten in, plastic bags on their heads."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Knodt travelled far west to Lviv. This quaint former outpost of the Austro-Hungarian empire had become a hub for the displaced, especially young, mobile professionals. The city, once a stuffy bastion of tradition, was transformed by its hip new inhabitants."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Halya Shyyan, a local writer, says war made Lviv discover a more open version of itself. \u201cThe city was always charming, but it was limiting, a vacuum, closed,\u201d she says. In her childhood, natives viewed the east with suspicion. Someone from Kyiv, a mere 470km away, was deemed \u201cexotic\u201d. Now schoolchildren from Lviv are studying alongside kids from Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, cities deep in the alien east. That is healthy, Ms Shyyan suggests."}, {"role": "body", "text": "None of this was obvious to Mr Knodt when he arrived in Lviv in April 2022. Displacement had robbed him of joy. Yet he found comfort in techno music. \u201cI have this idea that dark, difficult, complex acoustic phenomena help you get through the darkest times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t tell you to clap and be happy. You should just be yourself with other people around you.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Knodt soon found himself organising techno raves. He put on the first with a friend, Karina Malinovska, in the autumn of 2022. Later the two produced parties separately. One was called \u201cPtakha\u201d (bird), an \u201call-welcome\u201d rave. Another was \u201cDarkred\u201d, a gay event with bondage themes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not everyone in Lviv welcomes this sort of thing. Ms Malinovska is accused of distracting people from the war effort. Nonsense, she says: both Ptakha and Darkred collect money for the troops. \u201cLife should not stop, because it does not stop,\u201d Ms Malinovska says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first Darkred parties were timid. But as Mr Knodt\u2019s confidence grew, he began experimenting with all kinds of kinks, including piercing performances. \u201cThe locals were scandalised,\u201d he says. \u201cBut soon enough they were asking when the next one was.\u201d"}, {"role": "second", "text": "kyiv | Under the dome"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since Mr Putin failed to capture Ukraine\u2019s capital in March 2022 and his army fell back to pillaging the east of the country, life in Kyiv has all but resumed its normal rhythm. The economy is recovering. Caf\u00e9s are full. Rents are rising. None of this would be possible without the ceaseless vigilance of the 96th missile brigade of Air Command, under Colonel Serhiy Yaremenko."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He says he is proud his forces have given residents a sense of security. But Russia has a lot of missiles. Most of those that Col Yaremenko\u2019s men shoot down are flying low. Burning, heavy fragments can fall on houses."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ballistic missiles are still hard to detect and intercept. Some residents are so confident in the protective \u201cdome\u201d over Kyiv that they don\u2019t bother running to bomb shelters. Such people \u201care fooling themselves\u201d, he says. At peak periods, Yaremenko\u2019s men work round the clock: intercepting Russian missiles during the night and preparing the next night\u2019s defences during the day. Family life is put on the back burner. \u201cBlack days\u201d are common, the commander says. Nine of the men directly under his command have died in service. But it\u2019s the civilian deaths that hurt most."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard if you hear someone has died in Kyiv because a missile has got through. You keep thinking it over and over. But you realise you have to keep going.\u201d There are happy moments, too. Every interception is \u201ca triumph\u201d, he says. Messages of thanks from the public: \u201cthey mean so much.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is a race against Russian technology and cunning. The Ukrainians have just about managed to stay ahead. On May 4th Col Yaremenko gave the order for his crew to intercept a supposedly unstoppable Kinzhal ballistic missile for the first time. That was a real \u201cwow\u201d. Russia, meanwhile, claims to have destroyed all five of the two Patriot anti-missile systems in Ukraine."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Col Yaremenko never believed Russia would fire 150 long-range missiles at a peaceful neighbour on the first day of an unprovoked invasion, but it did. He could not imagine that Mr Putin would keep the support of ordinary Russians as he sacrificed their sons to his vanity war, but if Russian polls are to be believed, he has. \u201cThere is no point looking for moderation with the Russians. We have to be ready for anything.\u201d"}, {"role": "second", "text": "odessa | A port without a port"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Perhaps half of Ukraine\u2019s imports and exports\u2014 cars, fridges, grain\u2014used to flow through Odessa\u2019s three deep-water ports.

Now he\u2019s earning less than half that for a five-day week of 12-hour shifts loading cargo onto trains at an inland depot. His specialist skills are not needed there. Like many other dockers, Mr Brusko has put his CV on a local job-search site."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The boats used to line up to enter Odessa\u2019s docks, he recalls. Now it is rare to see one on the horizon.

His brother left 31 years ago to work in the Russian far east. The two exchanged a few terse words earlier in the war. Once upon a time, Mr Brusko might have humoured the weird chats about \u201cbrotherly nations\u201d (Mr Putin\u2019s Orwellian code for neighbours he wants to subjugate). But now communication is impossible.\u201c You don\u2019t understand how hard it is to say: \u2018Brother, we have to stop talking to one another.\u2019\u201d"}, {"role": "second", "text": "zaporizhia | Front-line city"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Antonina, 60, is one of Zaporizhia\u2019s newest residents.

A group of soldiers appeared outside her gate and started speaking in Ukrainian. Perhaps the Russian saboteurs have learned to speak Ukrainian, she thought?

War had begun."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The story of how a massive Russian force failed to take Kharkiv, a city on its doorstep, is complicated. But nothing exemplifies the Ukrainian defenders\u2019 spirit better than the binmen of Kharkiv.

So the binmen did not."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If a shell landed too close, they moved around the corner and kept working. There were many close calls. Fully 30% of the city\u2019s standing rubbish containers were damaged. Ivan Kluii, 39, a driver, was in a column of lorries when cluster munitions started landing. His vehicle escaped, but the second and third were hit by shrapnel. \u201cYou felt sheer panic in the moment.

They would shout at the crews to take cover in cellars and inspect the lorries, somehow expecting to find Russian saboteurs in the compactor.

Some have volunteered to fight, even though, as essential workers, they don\u2019t have to. And Kharkiv is daring to breathe again. All but 300,000 of its pre-war population of 1.6m have returned. Every little effort to restore normality\u2014from organising a party to clearing up after\u00adwards\u2014is an act of defiance, a refusal to submit to the grandiose visions of the tyrant in Moscow.
