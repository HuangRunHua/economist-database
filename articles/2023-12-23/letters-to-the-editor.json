As a businessperson, I wholeheartedly agree with your conclusion: the best thing the European Union can do to support the startup and scaleup community is to move away from digital-specific regulation and focus more on creating a truly single market. The single market is our best tool to strengthen European competitiveness, especially in a world of severe competition from America and China.

Hopefully, the forthcoming proposal from Enrico Letta, a former Italian prime minister, to strengthen the single market will receive the political attention and investment it so desperately needs. Aside from easing access to national markets of the EU, consider how a deeper single market would also enable scaleup by facilitating better access to investment funding."}, {"role": "body", "text": "EU capital markets have shown some growth year on year since 2015.

There are actually huge differences behind the numbers. The French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars resulted in an estimated 3.5m to 4m deaths, including up to 1m civilians, over a period of some 25 years. Not all of those deaths can be attributed to the Grande Arm\u00e9e or to Napoleon personally, since the first round of warfare was initiated by the countries opposed to the French revolution.

In the second world war around 40m to 45m perished in the European theatre of the conflict, including the Soviet Union. That represents approximately 9% of the total population of Europe, including the European part of the Soviet Union, of around 485m people at that time.
