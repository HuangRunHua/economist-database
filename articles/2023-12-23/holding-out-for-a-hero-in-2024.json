Yet amid the added glitz and ghouls, in one important and telling way\u2014typical of a leery, disillusioned age\u2014the film dims the story\u2019s magic. Like other popular franchises, it undermines its own hero, Hercule Poirot. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cYour mysteries give me faith the wicked will meet justice,\u201d a crime-writer character is told. \u201cSadly,\u201d she replies, \u201clife doesn\u2019t round out so well as detective fiction.\u201d A suspect complains that \u201chumans are so desperate to shape chaos into tidy stories.\u201d The winking message is: evil cannot really be vanquished by the \u201clittle grey cells\u201d of a moustachioed Belgian sleuth. In case you missed it, this is all a fantasy, even a joke."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Poirot is only the latest headliner to endure such self-sabotage. In \u201cGoldenEye\u201d (1995) the spymistress, M, calls James Bond \u201ca sexist, misogynist dinosaur\u201d. His re-education culminates in the finale of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021), a showdown for which he sentimentally clutches a soft toy. In contrast to this relatively abstemious 007, at the start of Indiana Jones\u2019s latest caper the dauntless archaeologist is a boozy has-been. \u201cI don\u2019t need morality lessons from an ageing grave-robber,\u201d his sidekick tells him cuttingly."}, {"role": "body", "text": "You might expect the superheroes of the multiverse to be exempt from such deflation. They are not. In \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d (2019) Thor goes to ground after beheading a death-lord. He re-emerges, several pounds over his flying weight, as a beery, burpy slob. When he runs into his mother on a time-travelling mission, she enjoins him to \u201ceat a salad\u201d. Sure, Thor is a god, but he is as fragile and needy as anyone."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are good reasons to fit your heroes with feet of clay. Flawed characters are more realistic and generally more interesting than idealised ones\u2014as Aristotle outlined in his \u201cPoetics\u201d in the fourth century BC. A drama\u2019s protagonist, he advised, should be noble but imperfect, \u201ctrue to life and yet more beautiful\u201d. From moody Hamlet to grumpy Rick in \u201cCasablanca\u201d, storytellers have complied. For icons like Bond and Poirot, senescence is also a factor. They are too lucrative to retire yet too familiar to portray without irony. Producers split the difference, at once reviving and ridiculing them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But politics, too, is catching up with the heroes of yore, whose habits and attitudes can grate today. It now seems a bit Neanderthal that, for generations, an expertise in violence was their main recommendation. From a 21st-century perspective, Bond\u2019s past attitude to women veered from caddish to borderline criminal. Indiana Jones (pictured) was sometimes disrespectful of the cultures whose treasures he ransacked. Poirot has often been an insufferable know-it-all."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The reformation of the blockbuster hero mirrors the humbling of leaders and luminaries in real life. Offences that were once overlooked in the powerful have become disqualifying for many. Deference is dying; politicians are widely assumed to be on the make or the take. These days the careers of flesh-and-blood heroes seem as likely to end in disgrace as in apotheosis."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Quite right too, in lots of ways. Talent and clout were used as armour against accountability for too long. Too many heroes, and the odd heroine, got away with murder, protected by acolytes and cowing their critics. Hold out for a hero, this history suggests, and they can wind up with an unhealthy hold on you. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, something is lost, on and off screen, when heroes are stripped of their auras and admiration is soured by cynicism. Characters who feel and fail like you are essential to most narratives; but there is still a place, even a need, for heroes and heroines who are nobler and cleverer than other mortals. They do not have to pack heat or crack whips and one-liners. They just have to let you dream that people can be finer, and the world fairer, than they tend to seem: to fulfil a wish without admitting to it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "You will never be as wise as Henry Fonda\u2019s character in \u201c12 Angry Men\u201d, as intrepid as Jodie Foster\u2019s in \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d or as suave as Cary Grant\u2019s in \u201cNorth by Northwest\u201d. But in 2024, as much as ever, it would be nice to believe that someone else is, at least until the credits roll. Heroes preside over hierarchies, and those can be abused. But a hero is also hope on legs. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d cuts the emperor down to size (Nov 15th)\u201cKing Lear\u201d and the purpose of tragedy in dark times (Nov 1st)David Beckham\u2019s guide to celebrity (Oct 12th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Back Story column got its name."}], "id": 70}
