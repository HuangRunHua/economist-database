That afternoon, a social-media page believed to be operated by Mr Girkin\u2019s supporters posted a triumphant dispatch about downing a Ukrainian military plane near Snizhne, a city next to Hrabove, only to edit it soon after. Sergey Dubinsky, one of Mr Girkin\u2019s deputies, tried to persuade his boss that a Ukrainian fighter jet had shot down mh17. Mr Girkin was sceptical. He pressed Mr Dubinsky to make sure \u201cthe equipment\u201d made it back to Russia.

(A Spanish ex-convict later told journalists he was paid by Russian sources to write the messages.) Some pundits blamed the cia.

As a share of the population, more Dutch died on that flight than Americans in the 9/11 attacks. Ms Van Boetzelaer, a prosecutor, volunteered for the mh17 criminal trial. She had the right name for the job: Digna, as in dignity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Digital sleuths from Bellingcat, an investigative journalism outfit, had pieced together social-media posts to trace the route of a Buk missile system from a base in Russia to separatist territory in eastern Ukraine, suggesting that Russia supplied the deadly weapon. Yet making that case stand up in court was another matter. The Dutch Safety Board first reconstructed the wreckage of the plane at an airbase in southern Holland. Distinctive butterfly-shaped shrapnel inside the pilots\u2019 bodies told them that the missile in question was a Buk. A Joint Investigative Team (jit) set up by Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine spent years gathering evidence into the Buk\u2019s provenance and chain of command."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Several legal cases were launched, including interstate trials between Ukraine and Russia at the European Court of Human Rights and the International Court of Justice, a UN body.

In the summer of 2019, they announced murder charges against three Russians and one Ukrainian: Mr Girkin, Mr Dubinsky, and two of their deputies, Oleg Pulatov and Leonid Kharchenko.

Maybe not me as a person, but the system has time."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Over years of hearings the jit team steadily built their case. Investigators had painstakingly cross-referenced and verified images and videos, often seeking out the original cameras or memory cards that captured crucial stages of the Buk\u2019s journey.

In mobile-phone footage from 2019, Mr Dubinsky can be seen drinking with another separatist commander on a boat in Crimea, toasting Mr Girkin, who had become a prominent nationalist activist back in Moscow, pressing for Russia to finish what it started in 2014. No wonder, then, that Mr Putin felt emboldened.
