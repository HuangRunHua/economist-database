The sandal floats out into the South China Sea."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the shoreline nearby, several of the man\u2019s high-school classmates are smoking.

Today, however, the streets of China\u2019s most prosperous city are no longer paved with gold. The economy is struggling. But the tattooed man and his blossom-shorted friends are a different kind of pioneer. Like millions of Chinese, they are making their first trip to the edge of their country\u2014to sample the pleasures of the beach."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mention of China\u2019s coast is more likely to conjure visions of warships in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait than sandcastles. But the population\u2019s growing enthusiasm for being beside the seaside also points to the changing relationship between state and society in China over the past 70 years. Tiny pockets of the country\u2019s 18,000km shoreline were first domesticated some 150 years ago, mostly by foreign colonialists, just as European beaches were becoming destinations for pleasure rather than simply medicinal sea-bathing or \u201ctaking the air\u201d. In the 1950s Mao Zedong rejected traditional imperial retreats for a summer getaway with top Communist officials at Beidaihe, near Beijing, once frequented by the British. It was from there that the Great Leap Forward was launched in 1958."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Few Chinese had jobs as portable as party bosses, however. In the West the dawn of mass travel saw holidaymakers jetting off to sunny shores at a time when most Chinese were tied to the land or factory. Leaving the city became a punishment for intellectuals in the 1960s, not a sightseeing experience. Even after restrictions on movement eased in the 1980s, urbanites typically used their one annual holiday to return home."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since then domestic tourism has taken off, boosted by speedy transport links and rising disposable incomes. China\u2019s beach culture was turbocharged by the pandemic, when socialising outdoors became desirable and those accustomed to overseas travel were forced to pursue their foreign-holiday practices at home. Even the party seemed to approve. When \u201cBorn to Fly\u201d, China\u2019s answer to \u201cTop Gun\u201d, was released in April 2023, it portrayed the fighter-pilot hero as a steely daredevil.

She recently passed a basic swimming test for her maritime-management course but is afraid to go in the ocean. Nor will communing with nature involve eating seafood. Chinese officials have stoked fears about contaminated fish since August, when Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the nuclear plant destroyed by a tsunami 12 years ago."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those who do brave the water face little danger. Mao swam the Yangzi river in 1966 to demonstrate his physical and political prowess as he launched the Cultural Revolution. Decades on, however, the Chinese remain largely a nation of non-swimmers. Apart from a dedicated troupe of dawn swimmers, most who venture into the sea at Dameisha wear inflatable rings\u2014even the adults\u2014and stay in the shallows. A lifeguard smokes or shouts into a megaphone, less to save lives than to enforce the boundaries of a narrow rectangle of the water given over to swimming. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even more glaring is the absence of figure-hugging swimming costumes ubiquitous in the West. Some women wear suits with sleeves and skirts or long shorts. Others sport swimming dresses with reinforced bodices and knee-length skirts. A few enter the water fully clothed. In four days, only one Chinese woman was observed in a regular swimsuit\u2014bright pink with frills\u2014which she had bought for her first beach holiday in 2021."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Wives of Communist leaders at Beidaihe sometimes wore Western-style swimsuits.

Why, then, the lack of swimsuits or bikinis today?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cBeing dark makes you look ugly and old,\u201d says a 57-year-old Beijinger who wears her cap low and an spf face-covering across her cheeks. To many people pale skin is also a proxy for class, distinguishing toiling farmers from city-types who think their office work and service jobs make them refined. (Europeans held a similar view until the 1920s when a tan became a sign of having leisure time.) Beachside shops cater to such fears, selling cotton sheaths to pull over bare arms, umbrellas for shade, covid masks repurposed as face protectors, and \u201cfacekinis\u201d\u2014swimming masks that reveal only the eyes, nose and mouth."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No swimming and no sunbathing. Few picnics; despite an outbreak of \u201cpicnic fever\u201d during the pandemic, most mealtime food in China is hot. Little booze and even less canoodling. Sure, some children dig holes and paddle.

In fact, she and many others are dressed for the beach: the shoreline is one long photo shoot. Four women have set up a tripod to snap selfies, two in flowing red dresses, two in qifu, a form of Chinese dress, with right arms raised to look as if they are holding up the sea. A woman in her 20s had travelled several hours that morning wearing a purple wig and purple mouse ears to take photos holding an illuminated star with fairy lights draped around her short purple dungarees."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the 1990s, when few Chinese had their own cameras, photographers with instant cameras would snap visitors at tourist sites. People wanted images not merely of an attraction or landscape, but of themselves in front of the setting. Those rare, precious Polaroids were the forerunners to the smartphone selfies posted online today; both are proof of an individual\u2019s experience. And a new destination must be celebrated with a special outfit. One woman (dressed in ordinary clothes) has brought her cat, Luna, trussed up in a peaked cap with holes for her ears and a lilac bodysuit."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For centuries China\u2019s imperial rulers viewed the country\u2019s shorelines as a buffer against a barbarian world. At times they forbade people from living within 15-25km of it. Today the sands at Dameisha are dominated by giant winged sculptures, commissioned by the city government. Impressive facilities serve the day-tripper\u2014large toilet blocks (which even boast soap, rare in Chinese bathrooms) and showers; the metro will soon connect the seaside to urban Shenzhen.

Entry gates capture an image of everyone who enters the beach; no state has more sophisticated face-recognition software than China. Tall towers stand every 120m up the beach with surveillance cameras pointing in all directions. Rather than encourage citizens to trust one another, a sign by a giant shoe rack reminds visitors that the cameras are watching.
