Another difference: Greg did not attend the last supper. He is very much alive."}, {"role": "body", "text": "An affable, burly man with a shaved head, Apostle Greg Hood can often be found at the premises of an organic, gluten-free snack-food company in Franklin, Tennessee.

Mr Hood is teaching a class on the theology of his sect, a charismatic Pentecostal movement bent on making America a Christian nation.

Some chalk it up to Mr Trump\u2019s conservative policies. (He appointed the judges who gave back to the states the power to ban abortion.) Others think they share Mr Trump\u2019s nostalgia for America\u2019s past\u2014an era when white Christians dominated the country. Yet another factor may also have played a role: the belief that Mr Trump was anointed by God to lead the country."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2016 a self-styled prophet named Lance Wallnau had a vision: the next president would be a latter-day Cyrus, the Persian emperor who, though not Jewish, was chosen by God to free the Jews from captivity. Mr Wallnau proclaimed Mr Trump, then a Republican candidate, the Cyrus of his dreams. The message was, even though he is not evangelical, \u201cTrump is sent by God to deliver conservative Christians back from cultural exile,\u201d says Matthew Taylor of the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies in Maryland."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Wallnau and Mr Hood are leaders of a Christian revival known as the apostolic movement or New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), which emerged in the 1990s. (Mr Hood denies belonging to the NAR yet espouses its beliefs.) Its adherents believe that God wants them to build his kingdom on Earth. Hindering them are demons, who govern vast swathes of the planet. To use a metaphor favoured by Mr Wallnau, these demons control seven mountains, each symbolising a sphere of life: family, religion, education, media, entertainment, business and government."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To vanquish the demons, believers must reform the church. The bureaucracy of Protestantism must go. The church must be ruled instead by independent, supernaturally gifted apostles and prophets, as it was in its early days. This is controversial: the church has not recognised apostles since the first crop appointed by Jesus, and Protestants broke with Catholicism because they believed spiritual authority resided in scripture, not a caste of intermediaries."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Champions of latter-day apostles and prophets retort that only these figures have the charisma, dynamism and spiritual authority to kindle the fervour necessary to best the demons, says Mr Taylor. By waging spiritual war against Satan\u2019s demon-generals, apostles and their flocks will recapture the seven mountains and plant God\u2019s flag in America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is hard to measure the size of this loosely organised sect. Yet there are indications that it is popular. Non-denominational churches\u2014a category to which the apostolic movement belongs\u2014are the only branch of Christianity in America that is growing. Harvest International Ministry, a network launched by an apostle nearly 30 years ago, claims to have more than 25,000 affiliated congregations around the world. The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest religious body in America in terms of number of congregations, still has twice as many churches in America. But it was founded more than 175 years ago."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many Americans agree with the apostolic movement\u2019s tenets. A survey in 2023 by Paul Djupe of Denison University in Ohio found that a quarter of Americans believe in modern-day prophets and prophecies. In a Pew poll in 2021, more than a third of white evangelicals said the government should stop enforcing the separation of church and state."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To that end, apostles engage in political activism. They shun the Democratic party (membership is a form of \u201cdemonic worship\u201d, Mr Hood has written) and cultivate ties with Republicans. Representatives Marjorie Taylor Green, Lauren Boebert and Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, are affiliated with the movement. Mr Trump is central to its plans. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "During the presidential campaign of 2016, Mr Wallnau observed that Mr Trump had already climbed the mountains of media and business and said God had foretold that he would also conquer the government peak. The rest of the apostolic movement quickly endorsed Mr Trump. Several of its leaders advised him during his presidency and formed a \u201cspiritual strike force\u201d called POTUS Shield to protect him from Satan. Many prophesied that he would win re-election in 2020, and their followers believed them. In a survey conducted by Mr Djupe shortly before the election, three in ten Americans believed Mr Trump \u201cwas anointed by God to become president\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After Mr Trump lost, an apostle named Dutch Sheets went on a tour of swing states, dubbed Operation Valkyrie, to prevent Satan from \u201ctak[ing] over the nation\u201d. \u201cThrough late November and early December, Dutch Sheets and his travelling band of prophets build this fever pitch of charismatic anger and assurance that God is going to intervene,\u201d recounts Mr Taylor in a podcast on the subject. Much of the rhetoric at these prayer meetings sounded like a call to arms: \u201cthe militiamen...of the kingdom of God are rising up in this hour\u201d and \u201cexpose the neck, swing the sword, finish the job.\u201d Hundreds of thousands of viewers watched live-streams of these rallies in late 2020."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On January 6th 2021 many heeded the call. \u201cChristian Nationalism was the central driving force\u201d that day, wrote Andrew Seidel, an expert, in testimony to Congress. Prophets battled the evil spirits embedded in the Capitol by praying, their voices amplified on a PA system. Protesters blew shofars, ram\u2019s horns which they believe can summon the forces of heaven.

Like Revolutionary-era supermen, they wore the uniform of the Continental Army under their robe, claims Mr Hood, and \u201cthey\u2019d lay their pistols on their pulpit as they preached.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cMaybe we need a little bit of that going on...These guys, after they would preach, they would lead their men into the battle against the crown of England...

I know the language can be kind of funny sometimes.
