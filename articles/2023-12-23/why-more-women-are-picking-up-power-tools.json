It looks like the staging area for a \u201cSaw\u201d trap. There are drills and nail guns neatly arranged on a shelf. The walls are made of metre-deep stone. There are no windows. We are in the middle of the woods. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hannah is not a serial killer. Far from it. She is known for something impeccably wholesome. She fixes up her home and posts about it. She is one of a growing number of female do-it-yourself influencers. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "All over America, women are upping tools. In Virginia Cass Smith, who posts videos of her projects on Instagram under the handle \u201ccassmakeshome\u201d, is building herself an office in her basement, from two ikea dressers. In Utah Elise Hunter, known as \u201chuntersofhappiness\u201d on TikTok, is hand-painting flowers to make wallpaper for the playhouse that she has built for her two young daughters. It is not just homeowners who are at it. On the Upper West Side of Manhattan Shelby Vanhoy has wallpapered the dining-room ceiling in the rented flat she shares with her husband, her son and an enormous dog. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "How big is this trend? The Bureau of Labour Statistics conducts an annual \u201ctime use\u201d survey in which it asks thousands of Americans what they do with their days. Taking \u201cinterior maintenance, repair and decoration\u201d as a proxy for DIY, it finds that Americans in general are doing less of it now than two decades ago. But drill down into the data and another trend becomes clear. Men still do more diy than women, but over the past five years the time that men spend on it has remained flat while women have put in 60% more. This is partly because the number of women reporting that they do diy has risen by nearly 20%, but also because they are devoting more time to it. In 2017 female diyers reported spending nearly four hours per weekend on projects. In 2022 it was almost five. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much has been made of the post-pandemic boom in diy. James Loree, the then boss of Stanley Black & Decker, a maker of tools that old-fashioned folks might deem manly, reported that, after a dearth of activity in April 2020, sales had leapt 30-40% year on year in early summer as people, stuck at home, discovered or rediscovered diy. \u201cWe enjoyed [an unprecedented] surge in North American retail,\u201d he said in January 2021. Far less has been made of the fact that it was women driving this surge. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "During the pandemic, women who do diy on the internet started to get famous. Elise found \u201cviral\u201d success with her videos after she joined TikTok in late 2020. An early post showed her recreating a ceramic lamp with knobs on it, which retailed for $695, from an old light, some wooden beads and superglue. It ended up looking uncannily like the spike protein structure of the coronavirus. Shelby recalls how she and her husband moved to New York just before the virus started spreading. \u201cIt was when I started making over that apartment that things really took off,\u201d she says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Something similar happened with Hannah. In September 2020, when everyone was obsessing about avoiding contact with other people, she posted a video with the title \u201cI\u2019m moving into the woods alone\u201d. That, she says, was when she \u201cblew up\u201d. She now has 1m subscribers on YouTube."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is much about these women-doing-diy that varies. Their aesthetics, for one. Shelby\u2019s style is old and European-inspired. Elise\u2019s home is a kaleidoscope of pastel girly-hued paints and wallpapers. Hannah, whose house looks increasingly like a fairy-tale cottage and who adopted a litter of orphaned mice, is often compared to a Disney princess by her followers. Like Cinderella, if only her fairy godmother had conjured her up a Dewalt drill instead of a ball gown."}, {"role": "body", "text": "They seem to fall into three broad buckets. Most, from an anecdotal scroll, seem to be mothers of young children making over their family homes, like Elise and Cass.

Their tools are mostly things that resemble giant stickers: \u201cpeel-and-stick\u201d wallpaper, which can be slapped up and peeled off with relative ease; faux-marble \u201ccontact paper\u201d which can convert a drab laminate countertop into something that looks (from a distance) like a $3,000 marble slab. Shelby, who rents her two-bedroom flat, is queen of the command strip\u2013a sticky velcro-type contraption that can stick things to walls without marking them.

Still, in a city apartment, without much space to store power tools, most of the manipulation she does of her home is manual. \u201cEvery dowel you see in here? I sawed them all by hand.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The most radical diyers seem to have taken the diy approach to their entire lives. Hannah started doing projects to kit out a van to live in as she travelled around America. She has since bought two cabins, a house and lots of tools to do them up.

Cass has written that her \u201cvisions started becoming bigger\u201d but her \u201cbudget was still small\u201d. Second, they are impatient. Elise has written that she \u201cseized the power tools\u201d when she no longer wanted to wait for her husband to be free to help her. \u201cWhen I have an idea I just want to get going,\u201d says Shelby. Third, they learned a tonne about diy from YouTube."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Various changes over the past 70 years have made it easier for women to diy.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "YouTube videos, which took off in the 2010s, made it easier to learn essential skills. Rather than reading a DIY manual full of jargon, you can look up a task and watch someone do it. Clips of women doing diy appear popular.
