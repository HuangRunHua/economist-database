Some modern visionaries don\u2019t want to make it; they want to drill for it. A rush is starting for colourless gold."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unlike actual gold, hydrogen is spectacularly useful. As a fuel, in theory it could power cars, buses, planes and ships.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Governments are throwing subsidies at efforts to make hydrogen fuel. America\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act offers lavish support for producing it cleanly from fossil fuels (which involves the clunky process of capturing and sequestering the carbon dioxide by-product), as well as from carbon-free nuclear power and renewables (which requires lots of energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The snag is that making hydrogen in any of these ways is costly, and likely to remain so for years. Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe but, says America\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, \u201ctypically does not exist freely\u201d on Earth. It is normally found bound up with oxygen, as water, or carbon, as hydrocarbons. Releasing the hydrogen can require lots of energy, complicated kit and hassle.

Some thought petroleum might work as a replacement, but many attempts to dig for it had flopped.

You\u2019re crazy.\u201d Then, one day in 1859, Drake hit a gusher, and the oil age began."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Could something similar happen with hydrogen? In a small way, it already has. In 1987 in Bourakebougou, in a remote corner of Mali in West Africa, locals searching for water drilled 100m down and, since the hole was dry, gave up. Then, to their surprise, a mysterious emission from that hole caught fire.

The villagers, seeing flames shooting out of the ground, assumed the place was cursed. Mr Diallo, who is not superstitious, decided to investigate. Tests confirmed that the well was producing 98%-pure hydrogen. Mr Diallo brought in equipment from Canada to do more drilling and testing. A coup in 2012 spooked outsiders, but he forged ahead. Now those villagers have reliable light and power day and night\u2014a rarity in rural Mali.

Mr Diallo\u2019s firm drilled over two dozen more wells, from shallow ones akin to the first water well to ones 1,800m deep, to map and master the geology. Hoping to replicate his success elsewhere, he has set up a firm called Hydroma in Canada to scour more stable countries for the gas.

Hydrogen has been found in France, America, Brazil, Australia, Colombia and Oman (see map). A place in Turkey thought to be the location of the original Olympic flame has burned for millennia thanks to an energy source now known to be rich in hydrogen. The mid-Atlantic ridge and the African rift valley emit the gas. And mysterious surface formations known as \u201cfairy circles\u201d, spotted in the Carolinas, Poland and western Australia, also appear to seep it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Why have these hydrogen sources not previously been noticed? It may seem odd, but big oil firms never looked for hydrogen or deployed sensors to detect it. Geoffrey Ellis of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) adds that, as well as being odourless and colourless, the gas is often gobbled up by microbes below the surface. So prospectors may have to drill with the explicit intention of detecting hydrogen if they are to find what is hidden under their noses.

After reviewing over 500 studies, he had a breakthrough."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of the relevant field research over the past century took place in the Soviet Union and was largely unknown to Western researchers. Soviet engineers often found hydrogen not because they wanted it but because they had a different (and now debunked) theory of how petroleum originates. They believed it was generated from inorganic matter rather than crunched-up dinosaur bones. On this view, carbon from the earth\u2019s mantle would interact with hydrogen deep underground to produce hydrocarbons, so it made sense to look for hydrogen as a telltale sign of petroleum. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are, by one estimate, more than a dozen ways that hydrogen might occur naturally, but only a handful seem likely to yield commercially extractable deposits (see graphic). The most promising, says Dr Zgonnik, is serpentinisation: iron-rich rocks below the Earth\u2019s surface react with very hot water to produce iron oxide and hydrogen gas\u2014in effect, rusting. This reaction has been well studied. Dr Zgonnik\u2019s company, Natural Hydrogen Energy, has identified a likely spot in Nebraska and drilled the world\u2019s first wildcat well for hydrogen, to a depth of some 3,400m. Though the pandemic and financial constraints have slowed it down (\u201cvery few investors are willing to take this kind of risk,\u201d he sighs), with new partners the firm plans to drill again soon at the site."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231223_WOF987.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 3352.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another theory, deep-seated formation, holds that hydrogen is produced deep in the earth\u2019s core or mantle, and seeps up to the surface as it rides along cracks. Yet another, known as radiolysis, proposes that energy from radioactive rocks splits water into hydrogen and oxygen deep underground. However hydrogen is formed, its molecules are so small and slippery that it can easily seep its way to the surface unless it is either caught in a trap (say, under an impermeable salt layer) or consumed by microbes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since the publication of Dr Zgonnik\u2019s article, interest in hydrogen has been fizzing.

The USGS will soon publish an assessment of the most promising locations\u2014in other words, a treasure map."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The search for hydrogen is attracting millions of dollars in investment, says S&P Global, a financial-data firm. Australian explorers such as HyTerra and Gold Hydrogen have raised millions more through public offerings. Other efforts are funded by government grants or quiet money from oil and mining giants.

At Ohio State University Tom Darrah, the firm\u2019s chief technology officer, and a team of researchers are working feverishly in an ordinary-looking cinderblock building.

After looking at those notes, which showed extremely high concentrations of the gas, Gold Hydrogen decided to drill at the same location. Neil McDonald, the firm\u2019s boss, reports ecstatically that the initial data from drilling in October show that hydrogen levels are still high there, just as they were in 1931.
