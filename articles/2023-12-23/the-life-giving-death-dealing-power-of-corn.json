It was South Carolina\u2019s second-biggest killer after tuberculosis."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Its first symptom was a symmetrical rash\u2014on both hands and feet, and joining below the collarbone like a necklace. It caused stomach pain and vomiting, then confusion and delusions. These were known as the \u201c4Ds\u201d (dermatitis, diarrhoea, dementia and death). Some victims killed themselves at the first D."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cases of pellagra peaked in 1928, by which time it had sickened more than 3m Southerners. Some doctors thought it was carried by flies. Others, noting that pellagrins were mostly peasants, blamed poor hygiene. In 1913 South Carolina concluded that it was an intestinal disease circulating in outhouses."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A few observed that pellagra was common in places where corn was a staple. Italian peasants ate lots of polenta and American Southerners ate grits\u2014not to mention cornbread, cornpone, hushpuppies, hasty pudding and spoonbread, all made from cornmeal. What if some of this meal harboured a tiny toxic organism?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The corn theory gripped the public. \u201cIf you fear pellagra, beware of corn\u201d, warned the New York Times in 1909.

And why was pellagra only now an epidemic, when Southerners had been eating corn for centuries?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1914 the surgeon-general put his best infectious-disease specialist on the case and sent him south: Joseph Goldberger, a New Yorker who began his career examining immigrants. In the Public Health Service he studied malaria, typhus, measles, dengue and yellow fever (and caught at least three of them himself)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Goldberger saw that pellagra was nothing like the diseases he had spent his life battling. From a mental hospital in Mississippi that was filled with pellagrins, he reported that not a single case had developed in the staff. As he spent time in milltowns and orphanages, he observed that Southerners subsisted on the \u201c3Ms\u201d\u2014cornmeal, fatty meat and molasses\u2014in winter and spring. Rates of pellagra shot up in those months, then fell again when the first vegetables became ready. They were also higher in women than men. He observed that families routinely fed children and men the protein-rich tidbits; mothers ate the leftovers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Goldberger was convinced the disease was a \u201cfault of nutrition\u201d\u2014that something essential was lacking.

Though citrus fruit had long been known to cure scurvy, vitamin C was not identified until the 1930s; limes were viewed as an antidote to noxious air on ships. Goldberger was inspired by the discovery that rice husks cured beriberi, which afflicted those who ate lots of polished white rice. Only years later was a vitamin found in husks and named B1."}, {"role": "body", "text": "B3, or niacin, was identified as pellagra\u2019s cure in 1937. It helps the body turn food into energy and make new DNA. Sweet potatoes and peas have it, protecting Southerners in summer and autumn; milk contains an amino acid that produces it. In 1941 America\u2019s Food and Drug Administration set standards for fortifying food with vitamin B3. By 1950 America eradicated pellagra by manufacturing a food additive on an industrial scale.

The Maya gods made people out of corn dough. And corn gave birth to Mesoamerican civilisations like the Maya.

No country grows or consumes more than America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Humans gave life to corn, too. Over 8,000 years ago in Mexico, a passer-by chewed on a sweet wild grass called teosinte and, liking it, shared it with others. Over time they changed its genetic make-up, by selecting for the development of milky seeds. Corn cannot self-pollinate. It depends on humans for its survival: only they can free and plant the seeds trapped in its husk."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231223_XMD011.jpg", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 1797.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Few plants hold so much fat, sugar and carbohydrates.

They dismissed this as a curious ritual. They had no taste for the earthy, bitter aroma of nixtamalised corn, says Rachel Briggs of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). In the mid-1800s officials seized tribal lands and forced tens of thousands of Native Americans west. Many died. But women sewed seeds into the hems of their skirts and nixtamalisation survived. When pellagra showed up on their ancestral lands, few Native Americans fell ill with it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1901 the Beall Improvement Company extended the shelf life of ground corn by removing its germ\u2014the reserve of all its niacin.

Today less than 5% of the corn America grows is eaten on the cob, from the can, as popcorn or cornmeal (most goes into cattle feed and biofuel). Yet corn is central to American diets. It shows up in 4,000 products in the average grocery store, as dextrose, lecithin, sorbitol and xanthan gum. Test almost any strand of American hair for a form of carbon found only in corn, and you will find that a majority of the carbon in that person\u2019s body is corn."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The American idea of corn has been reduced to a genetically engineered ear of around 800 yellow kernels in 16 rows.

Some varieties of corn are bound to a location and associated with a tribe: Cherokee White Eagle corn or Hopi Blue, for instance. The Catawba Nation, a tribe in South Carolina that has lived in the area for 6,000 years, is growing its rainbow-coloured corn for the first time in generations. The kernels were found at a local agricultural agency, where they had been since the 1800s."}, {"role": "body", "text": "None of the 1,000 Catawba living on the reservation knew how to nixtamalise anymore.
