On October 7th Hamas militants crossed from Gaza and went on a rampage in the surrounding area, killing 1,200 people, 364 of them at a music festival. Some 240 people were taken hostage. The scale of the attack, the mutilation of bodies and brutal assault of women shocked the world, yet antisemitism surged. Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza, flattening swathes of the Palestinian territory and killing 20,000 people, including militants. By the end of the year America was signalling to Israel that it should seek to wind down the conflict."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Before the Hamas attack Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s government was already under pressure, as hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in a wave of rallies to protest against controversial reforms to the judiciary."}, {"role": "second", "text": "God rest ye merry gentlemen"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a historic first, America\u2019s House of Representatives removed a speaker from office.

It took the dysfunctional Republicans a few weeks to choose a new speaker, Mike Johnson."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Donald Trump became the first American president, former or sitting, to face criminal charges in a federal court. The year ended with Colorado\u2019s Supreme Court ruling that Mr Trump was ineligible to run in the state\u2019s primary because he fanned the insurrection in Washington in January 2021. Mr Trump faces 91 criminal counts across four cases."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine dragged on. Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive against the invaders didn\u2019t make much headway, though Volodymyr Zelensky claimed some success in diminishing Russia\u2019s naval power in the Black Sea.

The drug companies behind new obesity treatments, such as Novo Nordisk, also saw their value balloon. And with the pandemic over, travel companies fared well (though the American government lost track of the many complaints made against airlines).

The conservative People\u2019s Party thought it had won in Spain, but it couldn\u2019t form a coalition so the Socialists returned to government, with the support of Catalan separatists in return for a controversial amnesty. In Thailand the election victor also did not form a government. The royalist establishment didn\u2019t like the reformist Move Forward party so parliament voted the Pheu Thai party into office instead. The establishment in Guatemala tried to derail the victory of Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, an anti-corruption candidate. A centre-left coalition won Poland\u2019s poll, ending eight years of contentious rule by the Law and Justice party.
