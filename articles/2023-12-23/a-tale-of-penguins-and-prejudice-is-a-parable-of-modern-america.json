It is easy to see why the creatures are a hit. They wobble around their barren terrain like drunks trying to walk straight for a patrolman. Some engage in what seem to be lively conversations, flapping their wings for emphasis. (Others spend a lot of time staring at rocks.) Diving into their pool they become as lithe and dexterous as they are clumsy on land, rocketing out after their dips in gravity-defying bursts. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Of the various species in the cold, smelly enclosure, the feistiest are the chinstrap penguins, so called because of the black markings below their beaks. For a novice they are hard to tell apart; but, says Rob Gramzay, who oversaw their care for 17 years, zookeepers come to know the penguins individually while hand-feeding them fish twice a day. Some are sweet, says Mr Gramzay, others \u201creally ornery\u201d. Between Silo and Roy, \u201cSilo was definitely the one with more attitude.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1998 Mr Gramzay noticed that these two males were spending most of their time together. They exhibited the same behaviours as male-female pairs, such as squawking at each other and showing off in courtship displays. When, a year later, Mr Gramzay saw Silo sitting on an egg-shaped rock in the nest the pair had built, he swapped in an egg made of plaster. In 2000 he gave them a real egg that two other chinstraps, Betty and Porkey, had discarded. His aim, he says, was purely to support the penguin colony, which had not raised many chicks."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Roy and Silo took turns incubating the egg for around 36 days. At the time Mr Gramzay was enjoying the tango music of Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer; when the egg hatched he called the new penguin Tango. She was \u201ca very sturdy chick\u201d, he recalls. He helped her learn to swim."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That might have been that, had it not been for a double stroke of fate. In 2004 the New York Times ran an article about the penguins, headlined \u201cLove That Dare Not Squeak Its Name\u201d. And, in their kitchen in Greenwich Village, a particular human couple read it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "They were just the right pair to incubate the story. A psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who teaches at Columbia University, Justin Richardson had interests in sex education and gay and lesbian mental health. On a blind date almost a decade earlier he had met Peter Parnell, a playwright who worked on \u201cThe West Wing\u201d. Lots of people, they knew, were squeamish about discussing homosexuality and gay parents with their children. Here was a tale of same-sex parenting from which everything that might cause discomfort\u2014even the word \u201cgay\u201d\u2014could be omitted. Two cute characters would overcome obstacles to reach their goal in a classic narrative arc. Unusually for the time, the children of same-sex couples would glimpse a version of their own experience."}, {"role": "body", "text": "They wrote fast. Mr Parnell quickly got out of his system a draft in which Roy and Silo loved Broadway musicals. Aided by a visit to the zoo, they stuck closely to the facts. \u201cWe got to hear them,\u201d Dr Richardson says of the penguins, \u201cand smell them.\u201d An illustrator, Henry Cole, contributed dreamy yet realistic watercolours.

Roy and Silo, however, were \u201ca little bit different\u201d.

But they could not have anticipated the way penguins came to be enlisted as political warriors. \u201cThe March of the Penguins\u201d, a documentary about emperor penguins in Antarctica, was released later in 2005. Some conservatives saw those birds as exemplars of parental devotion and stable relationships. In response, some on the left invoked the non-traditional family in \u201cAnd Tango Makes Three\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since many creatures have nasty habits like infanticide, basing moral arguments on their behaviour is inadvisable"}, {"role": "body", "text": "When, in 2006, two parents in Missouri complained about the book at a public library, it was reshelved in non-fiction.

Same-sex attachments among penguins are not a pernicious invention but a fact of nature. Mr Gramzay saw other such pairs in Central Park; they have been sighted in captivity in Berlin, London and Sydney. As for animals in general, says Paul Vasey of the University of Lethbridge in Canada, incidents of same-sex courtship and bonding have to some extent \u201cbeen observed in many, many species\u201d. (Hardly any animals, cautions Dr Vasey, are exclusively homosexual. And since many creatures have nasty habits like infanticide, basing moral arguments on their behaviour is inadvisable.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A second misconception concerns human sexuality. Whatever its mysteries, it is unlikely to be swayed by a picture book about penguins, a fear that seems to lurk behind many objections to \u201cAnd Tango Makes Three\u201d. As Dr Richardson puts it, wearing his psychiatrist\u2019s hat: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe that reading a book about homosexual waterfowl makes a child more likely to be gay when they grow up.\u201d Conversely, banning books with gay characters\u2014or their avian avatars\u2014won\u2019t change the fact that \u201cgay families exist\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A final confusion is over children and reading. It is not a mechanistic process whereby a story propounds a message and a child absorbs it. To think it is, says Marah Gubar, an expert on children\u2019s literature at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is to see young readers as defenceless blank slates, altogether inferior to grown-ups and worryingly impressionable. In reality they are, like adults, exposed to umpteen competing influences that they sift and process. As anyone who has read to a toddler knows, Dr Gubar notes, they already have tastes and ideas; they interpret books\u2014which tend to have several possible meanings\u2014in their own ways. The response to this one might be, \u201cI wanna be a zookeeper!\u201d In the encounter between child and book, \u201cIt takes two to tango.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The real-life union of Roy and Silo did not, alas, end happily ever after. They \u201cstayed together for a couple more years\u201d, remembers Mr Gramzay. Then Silo had a fling with a female chinstrap named Spike, before forming a long-term partnership with another female, Scrappy. (News of his change of mate and taste was greeted by some as a triumph of heteronormativity.) For his part, Roy took up with a male named Blue. Tango found a female partner called Tazuni."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There was a happier sequel for the authors.

Mr Parnell and Dr Richardson quickly tied the knot in Massachusetts, the first American state to make that possible. They hurried because, through surrogacy, they were about to become parents themselves. In 2009 their child was born: a girl (like Tango) whom they named Gemma. A few years later Mr Parnell wrote a funny, moving play about gay parenting called \u201cDada Woof Papa Hot\u201d, those four words having been Gemma\u2019s first. \u201cIsn\u2019t being normal the most radical thing of all?\u201d muses one of his characters."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This case of life imitating art, or artists imitating wildlife, would have made a fairy-tale ending to the saga of the \u201cgay penguins\u201d, as, rather anthropomorphically, they are often known. Yet like the tango of progress and pushback at its heart, the story was not\u2014and is not\u2014over. As swallows are to summer, the appearance of these chinstraps is a sign that cultural rows are dominating American politics. Now they are back."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Book bans come in waves. As Jonathan Friedman of pen America, a free-speech watchdog, recounts, they surged in the McCarthyite era after the second world war and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
