It is on its 23rd bail-out from the IMF, which demands in return painful fiscal measures, including cuts in subsidies for electricity and fuel. The Pakistani Taliban are resurgent. In January Pakistan exchanged missile fire with Iran; both sides say they were aiming at militants based in the other\u2019s territory. Hopes that the toppling of Pakistan\u2019s last military dictator\u2014Pervez Musharraf\u2014in 2008 would lead to a steady strengthening of democracy have been dashed. The generals are ensuring their role as the most important political players through a continuing \u201csoft coup\u201d. The army is doing all it can to prevent the return to power of Imran Khan, the former prime minister who was once a military favourite and has been recently sentenced to multiple jail terms. Pakistan has 230m people, nuclear arms and borders with Asia\u2019s two biggest powers, China and India. Here are six books on a large and strategically important country.

The frustrated actor turned Lincoln\u2019s Inn barrister is at the centre of the endless arguments about what Pakistan is for. Fundamentalists say that Pakistan should be ruled by sharia law. Liberals endorse Jinnah\u2019s exhortation that it should be a secular state in which Hindus \u201care free to go to your temples\u201d. Ayesha Jalal, a historian at Tufts University near Boston, Massachusetts, contends that Jinnah did not really want a separate Muslim homeland at all. He spent most of his political career campaigning for India\u2019s independence from Britain. But he began to worry that the Hindu-dominated Indian National Congress, the main pro-independence party, would sweep away privileges enjoyed by elite Muslims like him. When he latched onto the idea of Pakistan, he saw it as a \u201cbargaining chip\u201d to strengthen the position of the Muslim minority within an independent India. But Congress did not yield, and so Pakistan was born. When Ms Jalal made this argument in 1985 Pakistani scholars and patriots condemned it as heresy. The thesis is no longer taboo in Pakistan."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience. By Christophe Jaffrelot.

Christophe Jaffrelot, a French scholar of South Asia, identifies three major problems. One is Pakistan\u2019s unhappy attempts to manage its ethnic and cultural diversity. For the sake of national unity, Pakistan has long promoted a common culture based on Urdu, the language of the old Mughal court. But its attack on linguistic diversity helped lead to the secession of Bangladesh in 1971, four insurgencies in Balochistan, a province in the south-west, and violence in Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s megacity. Mr Jaffrelot goes on to discuss the perpetual tussle between the army and politicians, arguing that the conflict is not simply caused by the power-hungry generals who have periodically seized control. Politicians from Benazir Bhutto to Nawaz Sharif have also been authoritarian. Mr Jaffrelot finally tackles the civil war within Pakistani Islam between secular-minded reformers and Islamists. In 1974 the zealots changed the constitution to redefine the members of the minority Ahmadi sect as non-Muslims. The Islamists have been in the ascendant ever since, often helped by the armed forces."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fighting to the End: The Pakistan Army\u2019s Way of War. By Christine Fair.

Christine Fair, an American academic, makes her case using 60 years of the army\u2019s own publications and generals\u2019 memoirs. They reveal a paranoid \u201cstrategic culture\u201d shared by military men convinced that they are engaged in a civilisational battle with a neighbour that rejects the legitimacy of partition. Rather than merely seeking to dominate the subcontinent (which would be bad enough), India wants to reabsorb Pakistan, the generals believe. They consider Hindus to be meek and treacherous, and deem Muslims to be brave and committed to justice. From this flows much else, including the tactic of backing a myriad of anti-India jihadi groups while protected by a \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d. The generals\u2019 fear of Indian influence in Kabul, Afghanistan\u2019s capital, explains their obsession with \u201cstrategic depth\u201d, ie, ensuring that India has no foothold in Pakistan\u2019s northern neighbour. The contest for influence there is reminiscent of the \u201cgreat game\u201d\u2014Britain\u2019s competition with Russia for clout in Afghanistan during the Raj\u2014Ms Fair points out."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Pashtun Question: The Unresolved Key to the Future of Pakistan and Afghanistan. By Abubakar Siddique. Hurst; 299 pages; $48.50 and \u00a335"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is a thoroughly readable account of the Pashtuns, Pakistan\u2019s second-largest ethnic group, which is settled on both sides of the border with Afghanistan. Abubakar Siddique is a Pashtun who has covered his fellow tribespeople for years for Radio Free Europe. Much of his work has focused on the Pashtuns\u2019 tragic entanglement with Islamist militancy. The Taliban and its various offshoots on both sides of the border are an almost exclusively Pashtun movement. Militancy began after the British split the Pashtuns\u2019 historic lands between India and Afghanistan, triggering numerous \u201cfrontier jihads\u201d. After independence Pakistan backed Pashtun Islamists against nationalists who dreamed of creating a united Pashtunistan. Pakistan\u2019s government in Islamabad also sponsored Islamist rebellions against the government in Kabul and, during Afghan resistance to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s, directed American resources to the most extreme Pashtun fundamentalists. This helped dislodge the Russians but radicalised and militarised many Pashtuns. More than a million have died since 1979 in wars involving Russia, American-led forces and other Afghans. Support for Islamists also backfired on Pakistan. Even though Pakistan helped the Afghan Taliban seize power from an American-backed government in 2021, the Taliban refuse to do Pakistan\u2019s bidding. The Pakistani Taliban\u2014an offshoot\u2014have repeatedly turned their guns on Pakistan itself. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A Case of Exploding Mangoes. By Mohammed Hanif. Knopf; 336 pages; $16.95. Vintage; \u00a39.99"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Perhaps because it is such a troubled place, Pakistan produces fabulous art. \u201cJoyland\u201d, a film from 2022 about a man who falls in love with a transgender dancer, was rightly praised. The paintings of Salman Toor sell for more than $1m. The country also has many fine authors writing in English, including Mohammed Hanif. His debut novel, \u201cA Case of Exploding Mangoes\u201d, is a satire about the death of Zia ul Haq, the military dictator who seized power in 1977 and was largely responsible for Pakistan\u2019s Islamisation. The book imagines the events leading up to the explosion of his plane on August 17th 1988 through a series of darkly comic episodes. Many of Mr Hanif\u2019s characters want the pious and paranoid general dead. A bomb in a consignment of mangoes (Pakistan\u2019s national fruit) is just one of the weapons that would-be assassins consider. The cruelty and absurdity of Zia\u2019s rule is captured by the story of a blind woman who is gang-raped, then stoned for committing adultery. Mr Hanif trained to become an air-force pilot during the Zia era. One of Zia\u2019s would-be assassins is also a trainee pilot. The sequences set in the Pakistan Air Force Academy are worthy of Joseph Heller."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Travels in a Dervish Cloak: Adventures in Pakistan. By Isambard Wilkinson.

But these great events are secondary to his search for \u201cthe quiddity of Pakistan\u201d.

A beautiful writer, Mr Wilkinson paints a warm and generous picture of a diverse country of tribal chiefs and mountain valleys still populated by pagan tribes. But the problems are never far away. The Sufi shrines that he regards as the \u201cpulses of Old Pakistan\u201d are blown up by jihadis who hate tolerant, syncretic strains of Islam.
