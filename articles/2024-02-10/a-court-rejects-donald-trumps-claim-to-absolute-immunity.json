Mr Trump may be half-joking when he announces this plan to cheering throngs. But the Republican front-runner has a track record of swelling presidential power past its traditional limits, from declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the southern border, to withholding his financial records and White House communications related to the January 6th riot.

Bush."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump\u2019s pitch for immunity stems from the federal case brought by Jack Smith, the special counsel, concerning the former president\u2019s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The appeals-court hearing, which began on January 9th after a district-court judge also ruled that Mr Trump did not enjoy the \u201cdivine right of kings\u201d, exposed the extraordinary nature of the argument. When asked whether, for example, a president who had a political rival assassinated by SEAL Team Six could face a legal reckoning after leaving office, Mr Trump\u2019s lawyer answered no\u2014unless Congress had impeached and convicted him first. The judges were unimpressed. Making former presidents wholly immune from criminal exposure, they wrote, would abrogate \u201cthe primary constitutional duty of the judicial branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump\u2019s lawyers had argued that presidents might be \u201cchilled\u201d into inaction if a blanket of immunity does not await them upon leaving office (a claim Mr Trump repeated after the ruling). And yet, wrote the judges, past presidents have always \u201cunderstood themselves to be subject to impeachment and criminal liability\u201d, so any purported chilling effect has been in place throughout American history. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gerald Ford, for example, pardoned Richard Nixon after he resigned\u2014which was necessary only because both men knew that Nixon faced criminal prosecution for his involvement in the Watergate scandal. And Bill Clinton \u201cagreed to a five-year suspension of his law licence and a $25,000 fine\u201d to avoid having criminal charges filed against him after his presidency. Even if some presidents were to temper their actions through fear of \u201cvexatious litigation\u201d, the court wrote, that risk is outweighed by the public interest in holding former chief executives responsible for criminal misdeeds.
