Its record on money-laundering\u2014a big problem in India\u2014was particularly lacklustre: it conducted only 112 raids and failed to achieve a single conviction."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Under Narendra Modi, the ED (as it is known) has become one of India\u2019s most feared agencies. Since he became prime minister in 2014 it has conducted more than 3,000 money-laundering raids and secured 54 convictions. Most controversially, especially in the run-up to a general election due by May, it has targeted dozens of opposition politicians, including at least five party leaders\u2014while largely steering clear of bigwigs in Mr Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On January 31st ED officers arrested Hemant Soren, chief minister of the eastern state of Jharkhand, on suspicion of money-laundering. Mr Soren, who denies wrongdoing, leads one of the 27 parties in the main opposition alliance. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Opposition leaders have characterised the ED\u2019s activities as a malign effort by Mr Modi to stifle dissent and engineer his re-election. Mr Soren\u2019s was the first arrest of a sitting chief minister in India\u2019s history (although he had technically resigned a few hours earlier). He is also the first leader of the anti-BJP alliance to have been arrested. He may not be the last. The same day, the ED issued a fifth summons to a more powerful opposition leader, Arvind Kejriwal, who is Delhi\u2019s chief minister and heads the Aam Aadmi party. He is wanted for questioning in another money-laundering case. Mr Kejriwal, whose deputy is already in jail awaiting trial in the case, has denied any wrongdoing and refused to comply.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter) after Mr Soren\u2019s arrest, Mr Gandhi claimed that the ED and other investigative agencies were being used to eliminate the opposition. \u201cThe BJP, itself steeped in corruption, is running a campaign to destroy democracy in its obsession with power,\u201d he said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The BJP claims to be tackling corruption that became endemic under Congress. BJP officials also accuse Congress of having used state bodies, especially the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to harass opponents when it was in power. \u201cCorruption is in their nature,\u201d Amit Shah, the bjp home minister, said in December after tax raids on a Congress MP uncovered 2bn rupees ($24m) in cash. \u201cNow I understand why a campaign was run against PM Modi that agencies are being misused.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Graft was rife during Congress\u2019s rule. And it sometimes misused investigative agencies\u2014but to nothing like the degree seen under Mr Modi. Under the previous government, the proportion of cases against politicians that targeted the opposition was 54% for the ED and 60% for the CBI, according to an investigation by the Indian Express newspaper.

As for Mr Modi\u2019s claim to have cut corruption overall, activists and academics say low-level graft has declined, largely thanks to new digital payment and ID systems, which allow direct welfare payments, cutting out corrupt officials.
