Cheers from grateful onlookers greeted him as he rode around on his motorbike. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chinese cartoons have come a long way since then. While \u201cBlack Cat Detective\u201d was simply drawn and packed with blunt propaganda, today\u2019s offerings boast technical sophistication and engrossing narratives. The aesthetics of \u201cThe Storm\u201d, which opened in cinemas in January, look a lot like Studio Ghibli, the celebrated Japanese animation studio behind films such as \u201cSpirited Away\u201d. Another new movie, \u201cBoonie Bears: Time Twist\u201d (pictured), released on February 10th, is a family-friendly adventure with slick scenes reminiscent of Pixar, a pioneering animation studio now owned by Disney.

The Economist crunched data from Maoyan, a movie-ticketing service in China, and found the share of box-office receipts going to Chinese animated films took off after 2019 (see chart).

Japanese anime (including \u201cDoraemon\u201d, starring a schoolboy and a robot cat) and Western cartoons (such as \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d and \u201cCars\u201d) dominated television and cinema screens.

A big step up in graphical fidelity helped draw audiences, and so did film-makers\u2019 insistence that the storytelling appeal to adults.

It was not until \u201cWhite Snake\u201d (2019), a love story between a snake hunter and snake spirit (made for adults), that the studio enjoyed its first success. Its \u201c30,000 Miles from Chang\u2019an\u201d, which was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2023, featured lyrical recitals of poetry from the Tang dynasty and blended elements from Chinese culture, history and mythology.

Animations are usually chaste and do not touch on topics like sex, drugs or crime. That means they are less likely to fall foul of regulators, who vet and approve all films.
