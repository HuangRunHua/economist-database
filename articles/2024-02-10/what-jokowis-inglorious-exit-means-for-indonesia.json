A decade ago the former furniture salesman, popularly known as Jokowi, swept to power on a promise to defy the elites who had stage-managed the world\u2019s third-biggest democracy since the fall of the dictator Suharto in 1998. But instead of beating the power brokers, Jokowi (pictured centre-left) has joined them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the run-up to an election due on February 14th, the outgoing president has thrown his weight behind Prabowo Subianto (pictured centre-right), a former general and son-in-law of Suharto, who has an appalling human-rights record and a professed ambivalence towards democracy. Jokowi\u2019s eldest son is Mr Prabowo\u2019s running-mate\u2014courtesy of Jokowi\u2019s brother-in-law, who, as chief justice of Indonesia\u2019s highest court, lifted an age limit standing in his 36-year-old nephew\u2019s way."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240210_LDC309.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 572.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Jokowi\u2019s endorsement has made Mr Prabowo the favourite to win the presidency at the third attempt (he lost elections in 2014 and 2019, then falsely claimed they were stolen). His main rivals, Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo, both competent former governors, claim their rallies have been disrupted or cancelled by shadowy officials.

Its vulnerability to a strong dollar and shifts in global capital flows once made it a member of the \u201cFragile Five\u201d emerging markets. Thanks to prudent management, the public finances have improved and the economy is more stable. Indonesia has grown at around 5% a year pretty consistently. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Infrastructure has been overhauled, with thousands of miles of road and rail added. A package of reforms passed last year eased restrictions on foreign investment. By pressing firms to process nickel domestically, Jokowi has supported the development of an industry responsible for half the world\u2019s output. Improved governance has contributed, among other things, to a fall in the rampant deforestation that has long made Indonesia one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. The country\u2019s traditional \u201cnon-aligned\u201d foreign policy has put it safely between America and China on most issues.

The recent progress has come about in spite of Jokowi\u2019s authoritarian instincts and delusions of grandeur, which Mr Prabowo seems likelier to emulate. The former general backs an epic white-elephant scheme of Jokowi\u2019s to carve a new $34bn capital city out of the Bornean rainforest. He appears keen to extend protectionist nickel policies\u2014which will pay off only if demand for the metal remains high\u2014to less promising sectors. Tarnished by his alleged Suharto-era abuses\u2014on account of which America and Australia once barred him\u2014he remains prone to clumsy outbursts, including a speech last year in which he floated a Putin-friendly peace plan for Ukraine.

Nonetheless the cronyism so evident in his campaign is dispiriting. Jokowi arrived in 2014 as a breath of fresh air. But by failing to entrench Indonesia\u2019s democracy, even as he has strengthened its economy, he leaves behind a rotten smell. \u25a0"}], "id": 8}
