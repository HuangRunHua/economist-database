Before any official results were announced, Nayib Bukele claimed to have won at least 85% of the vote. In a speech from the presidential palace he called this \u201cthe record in the entire democratic history of the world\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bukele has indeed won with a landslide. With 70% of the votes tallied, he had 83%. His party, New Ideas, has probably won a majority in the slimmed-down national legislature, too, though perhaps not to the degree he claims. A problem with the electronic system means the votes for lawmakers now need to be counted by hand. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sticklers for the rule of law noted that it was unconstitutional for Mr Bukele to run for a second consecutive term. But in 2021 he got the top court to rule that he could run again if he took a six-month leave of absence, which he did, at least on paper. He insists that voters should be able to decide whether they want him to remain in office. \u201cWhy discard the path if it\u2019s working?\u201d he asked when announcing his run."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The immaculately coiffed, jeans-clad leader is popular largely thanks to his crackdown on crime. Before he took office in 2019, Salvadoreans lived in terror of gangsters, who extorted money from local businesses with impunity and fought deadly turf wars with each other. Gang crime used to cost a staggering 16% of gdp, by one estimate. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bukele first tried negotiating with the gangs. Then he switched to a mano dura (iron fist) approach. He let the police arrest anyone they suspected of gang ties. More than 74,000 people\u2014equivalent to over 8% of the young male population of the country\u2014have been locked up. Few have had trials yet, though they may eventually get \u201ccollective\u201d ones, with hundreds of suspects judged simultaneously. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "With so many gangsters behind bars, previously dangerous neighbourhoods have been transformed. The national homicide rate fell from 51 per 100,000 in 2018 to three last year. Shops and restaurants that previously had to pay protection money\u2014a huge drain on their livelihoods\u2014no longer have to. Ordinary folk can walk the streets without fear.

The country is now a much safer place to live in: the number of Salvadoreans trying to cross the border from Mexico into the United States fell by a third in the last fiscal year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bukele shunned traditional campaigning for PR stunts. He hosted the Miss Universe contest, shook hands with Lionel Messi and presided over a mighty communications machine, including trolls who steamrolled critics and drowned out unfavourable narratives. His public-relations push has helped change the international image of his country of 6.3m, too. He has marketed it as a surfers\u2019 paradise riding the wave of the future. In 2021 El Salvador was the first country to make bitcoin legal tender. (Shopkeepers are much less impressed by this than by his gang crackdown.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Critics worry about Mr Bukele\u2019s appetite for power and scorn for checks and balances. From the start he has lavished benefits on the police and army to secure their loyalty. He is also doubling the size of the army, from 20,000 to 40,000. In 2020 he marched troops into the legislature to intimidate lawmakers into approving funds for his security plan. A year later his party won a super-majority in the assembly, and he moved to increase his sway over the courts. He ousted the attorney-general and the judges of the constitutional court, and forcibly retired a third of the country\u2019s regular judges, replacing them with loyalists. His inner circle consists of his brothers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Before the election he changed the rules to favour his own party and made it easier for Salvadoreans who live abroad to vote. Ballots cast by the diaspora\u2014740,000 of the 6.2m registered voters\u2014all go to San Salvador, where the number of undecided seats is highest."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So what will Mr Bukele decide to do with a second term? F\u00e9lix Ulloa, the vice-president, says now the administration has \u201ccleaned the house\u201d of crime, the focus will be on education, health and infrastructure. He says that El Salvador is for the first time spending annually over 5% of GDP on education and has distributed laptops and tablets to all students. This fits with a push to turn the country into a tech hub, he says, pointing to the adoption of bitcoin and to laws encouraging investment by tech firms. He touts future infrastructure projects such as airports, a train along the Pacific coast and a cable car."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Bitcoin bro meets Miss Universe"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rather than worry about crime, Salvadoreans now see the economy as the country\u2019s biggest problem, according to a survey in January by the University of Central America in San Salvador. As public safety has improved, the economy has somewhat, too. The price of the country\u2019s government debt, which had collapsed to distressed levels in 2022, has bounced back. JPMorgan, a bank, reckons El Salvador\u2019s potential annual growth rate has risen from 2% to about 3%. But figures remain lacklustre: annual growth in GDP is forecast to remain lower than in Honduras and Guatemala for at least the next three years. No doubt Mr Bukele will want to secure a much-ballyhooed deal with the IMF."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government hopes to attract further cash from China, which paid for a fancy national library that opened in November. And El Salvador is offering a \u201cfreedom visa\u201d and a ten-year tax holiday to anyone who invests $1m of cryptocurrency in the country. Mr Ulloa says the government will soon issue bitcoin bonds. But Lourdes Molina, an economist, frets that the increased use of bitcoin could turn El Salvador into a money-laundering paradise. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A state of exception (ie, emergency) to fight crime was first declared in March 2022 and has since been renewed 22 times. Mr Bukele asked voters to give him a super-majority in the assembly so he can keep renewing it. This would hand him a potent tool to scare his remaining critics. It has already been used against union members and environmental campaigners, notes Ruth L\u00f3pez of Cristosal, a human-rights group. Only a few civil-society organisations and journalists remain active, says Bertha Dele\u00f3n, formerly one of the president\u2019s lawyers. Mr Bukele cites their continued existence as proof that El Salvador is a democracy. But in 2021 he tried to pass a bill to class some civil-society organisations and journalists as foreign agents, similar to laws in Nicaragua and Russia.

In a poor, rural area a couple in their 50s weep as they describe how three of their four sons, aged 15, 17 and 25, and a grandson, aged 15, were taken in November. Their kids were not gang members, they say; one worked for the government until he fell ill and the other two were at school all day. \u201cWe are now scared of the police and army,\u201d they say. In the UCA poll, 63% of respondents said they were \u201cbeing more careful\u201d about whom they discuss their political opinions with.
