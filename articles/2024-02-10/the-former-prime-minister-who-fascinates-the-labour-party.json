He has to revive a battered country like Clement Attlee (who was prime minister in 1945-51), modernise the economy like Harold Wilson (1964-70, 1974-76) and fix public services like Sir Tony Blair (1997-2007). The second of this trio particularly fascinates the party. Sir Keir flecks his speeches with Wilson-era clich\u00e9s (\u201cwhite heat\u201d and \u201cthe pound in your pocket\u201d). Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is an admirer, as is Nick Thomas-Symonds, a shadow minister and author of a well-reviewed Wilson biography."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Wilson left office tainted by sleaze and fixated by alleged MI5 plots against him. Labour\u2019s left reviled him as a schemer, the party\u2019s right as a relic who had failed to modernise Britain\u2019s economy or tame the unions. He has undergone a resurrection in part due to Labour\u2019s chronic nostalgia, and in part because it is tired of losing and Wilson was a winner (\u201cthe sine qua non of a successful leader,\u201d notes Mr Thomas-Symonds). The dates of his election victories are used by some in the party as shorthand for possible outcomes this year: a \u201c\u201964\u201d (a tiny majority), a \u201c\u201966\u201d (a big majority) or a \u201c\u201974\u201d (a hung parliament followed by a majority in another election called soon after). But the Wilson renaissance is also because his era has strong parallels with Labour\u2019s position today. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Keir, born two years before Wilson entered Downing Street, has followed a similar course. Both are workaholics from lower-middle-class families: Wilson\u2019s father was an industrial chemist, Sir Keir\u2019s a toolmaker. Wilson aligned himself with the leftist Aneurin Bevan, before becoming the Labour leader by tacking to the centre. Sir Keir, with a similar methodical ambition, served under Jeremy Corbyn before moving rightwards. Both marry high-mindedness with low cunning. \u201cThis party is a moral crusade or it is nothing,\u201d said Wilson of Labour. \u201cHe never much believed in ideology; he was an operator,\u201d said Roy Jenkins, his home secretary. Both shed a stiff, academic bearing for an everyman routine; a pipe, a mackintosh and a bottle of HP sauce were Wilson\u2019s props."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Keir will campaign like Wilson. In 1964, as today, Labour attacked \u201c13 wasted years\u201d of economic mismanagement and stagnation (in fact, real income growth has been far worse this time round). Sixties Britain was suffused with a declinist anxiety, which Sir Keir has revived. Britain is slipping so far behind its peers, he says, that the young will soon look for work in Poland. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Keir has also revived the rhetoric of class and meritocracy that Wilson turned into a cudgel. The root of Britain\u2019s economic woes, said Wilson, was that the cabinet and boardrooms were stuffed with aristocratic duffers whose \u201cgrouse-moor conception of national leadership\u201d was unfit for the jet age; Britain needed scientifically minded go-getters. (Sir Keir, who talks of a \u201cclass ceiling\u201d, switches grouse moor for Rishi Sunak\u2019s helicopter.) The answer was the expansion of comprehensive schooling and universities, which some in the shadow cabinet regard as Labour\u2019s greatest achievement. The foe of the \u201cold school tie\u201d would doubtless have cheered Ms Reeves\u2019s plan to levy VAT on private schools."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The shadow chancellor\u2019s economic agenda has a Wilsonesque edge. His \u201cnational plan\u201d, announced in 1965, promised to lift growth to 3.8% a year in order to stave off a currency crisis, fix regional imbalances and fund the swelling welfare state. Her growth \u201cmission\u201d targets the highest per-person increase in GDP in the G7. They share a vision of an active Whitehall working hand-in-glove with businesses and the unions to steer investment to productive ends. Like Wilson, the party\u2019s leadership today admires glossy manufacturing over services, wants a spree of housebuilding and preaches dull reform over grands projets. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "David Edgerton, a historian, argues that Sir Keir\u2019s ambition to remake capitalism pales compared with Wilson\u2019s. But there are still important things for Labour to learn from his premierships. Wilson\u2019s national plan was immediately undermined by pressure on sterling and the deflationary policies needed to support it. Wilson resisted devaluing the pound until 1967, harming his authority in the process. That left him too weak to pass trade-union reforms. At the time of writing, Sir Keir was expected to scrap a plan to spend \u00a328bn ($35bn) per year on green energy after months of dithering over its affordability given the state of the public finances. If so, he has belatedly learned one lesson from Wilson: Labour must act faster to acknowledge hard realities. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A second lesson concerns the Treasury. Wilson tried to bypass its short-term instincts (\u201cvery, very skilled chaps in more or less stopping you doing anything\u201d) by setting up a rival Department for Economic Affairs to run industrial planning. It was short-lived. The party today doesn\u2019t plan to break up the Treasury; Ms Reeves is shaping up to be an imperial chancellor. But it needs to figure out how to strengthen the centre of government so that its \u201cmissions\u201d of long-term reform aren\u2019t strangled by bean-counting. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "He who rejects change is the architect of decay"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The third lesson is that centre-left leaders can create the space for radical social reforms if they themselves hew to bread-and-butter concerns. Wilson oversaw a dizzying legal revolution: the abolition of capital punishment, the legalisation of homosexuality and abortion, the end of theatre censorship, and the passage of race- and sex-equality laws. Yet Wilson left the heavy lifting on such issues to Jenkins and others. He told his speechwriters to stick to working-class concerns: \u201cI don\u2019t want too many of those Guardian-isms, Environmentalism, Genderism etc.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Keir\u2019s speeches are blue-collar, yet he also shows glimmers of radicalism: he has indicated that he would welcome the decriminalisation of euthanasia should a private members\u2019 bill be brought. Ben Pimlott\u2019s biography of Wilson, published in 1992, affords his social reforms only passing mention over 700 pages. A leader can achieve a lot if they don\u2019t care who gets the credit. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Bagehot, our columnist on British politics: The search for Conservative Party unity (Feb 1st)Britain\u2019s Labour Party is backed by a pro-growth coalition (Jan 25th)Scottish nationalism\u2019s left turn (Jan 18th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Bagehot column got its name"}], "id": 50}
