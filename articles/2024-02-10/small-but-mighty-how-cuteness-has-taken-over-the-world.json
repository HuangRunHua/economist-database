Perhaps it shows a giggling baby or a rabbit nibbling strawberries. A red panda might be throwing its paws in the air, like a furry thief being apprehended, or a kitten may sit astride a tiny motorcycle. The supply of these endearing clips is huge. On TikTok there are 65m videos tagged #cute. The demand is even greater: those videos have been viewed more than 625bn times."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cute things are everywhere, not just online. In Japan\u2014where appreciation for all things kawaii is especially keen\u2014roadblocks come in the form of dolphins, ducks or frogs.

A new exhibition at Somerset House in London (pictured) also examines the ubiquity of cuteness in culture, bringing together art, games and toys.

In the 1940s Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian zoologist, found that people are drawn to babies with big eyes, a small nose and mouth and round cheeks, as well as a pudgy body, short arms and legs and a wobbly gait. These traits motivated people to nurture and protect babies, helping ensure their survival. Humans are so drawn to these attributes that cats and dogs may have been bred to emphasise those same features. Cartoon characters have morphed, too. For instance, Mickey Mouse\u2019s arms, legs and nose have shrunk since 1928, while his head and eyes have become larger."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240210_CUP502.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "A study from 2015 found that participants felt more energetic and positive, and less annoyed, anxious or sad, after watching cat videos.

Japanese artists in the Edo period (between 1603 and 1868) painted puppies or fashioned them out of ivory.

Technology has offered new ways to enjoy winsome things. Harry Pointer\u2019s photographs from the 1870s, on display at Somerset House, depict felines in anthropomorphised ways, sitting on tricycles or in prams.

Walt Disney brought a parade of wide-eyed creatures to cinemas across the world.

People could watch and share amusing content of their children or favourite animals at any time\u2014in 2022 more than 90,000 videos of cats were uploaded to YouTube every day. So voracious is the appetite for cute content that in 2014, when Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, was asked what surprised him most about internet usage, he replied simply: \u201cKittens.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cuteness has real-world uses.
