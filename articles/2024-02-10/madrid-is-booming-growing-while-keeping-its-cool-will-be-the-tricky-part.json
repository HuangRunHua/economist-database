King Felipe II made the middling town his new capital in 1561 in part simply because it was dead central and lacked competing powerful institutions; amazingly in such a Catholic country, Madrid did not even get its own completed cathedral until 1993. But later, as Spain\u2019s empire declined, so did Madrid\u2019s profile. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now Madrid is having a moment. Tourists are flocking, as well as would-be residents. They include Americans fleeing toxic politics, northern Europeans seeking an easy-living big city, and, most of all, Latin Americans. Some come to work in construction, care or hospitality. Others are rich Venezuelans and Mexicans fleeing confiscatory populism. The foreign population has grown by 20% since 2016, much of that Latino, making Madrid a growing rival to Miami as the \u201ccapital of Latin America\u201d. The Madrid region is richer than Rome\u2019s and not far behind Berlin\u2019s."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The city\u2019s and region\u2019s governments, both of them run by the conservative People\u2019s Party, have welcomed the influx. Last year the region announced a plan to let people who invest in Madrid\u2014including in property\u2014offset 20% of the cost from their taxes, for example. Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, the pugnacious regional president, gleefully contrasts Madrid\u2019s low-tax, light-regulation approach with a supposedly overbearing national government. But that Socialist-led national government has done its bit for Madrid, too. It has so far kept a \u201cgolden visa\u201d\u2014giving residency to those who invest \u20ac500,000 ($537,000)\u2014while passing a \u201cdigital-nomad\u201d law to attract knowledge workers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, Madrid\u2019s mayor, says a turning-point came with the pandemic, when Ms Ayuso battled the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to keep businesses open. Covid-19 took a terrible toll, but Madrid emerged with a reputation for openness. \u201cBefore, it was the best-kept secret. Now it is the place to be,\u201d says Mr Almeida, uttering the final phrase in English."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The attractions include culture, low and high. For a long time the Prado museum\u2019s stuffy, traditional presentation of a brilliant collection was not enough to attract foreigners away from the coasts. Now it anchors a trio of stylish museums (with the Reina Sofia and the Thyssen-Bornemisza) that welcome over 7m visitors a year. But the museum of the Bernabeu stadium, home to the Real Madrid football club, attracts over a million a year too, and the city has just nabbed the Spanish Formula 1 Grand Prix race from Barcelona. The number of musicals in the city has doubled to 14-15 since the pandemic. Cheap tapas are being joined by an increasingly sophisticated gastronomy, often drawing on Spanish regions far from Madrid."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The city\u2019s weight in Spain is growing, too. In 1980 the region accounted for 15% of Spanish GDP. In 2022 the share was 19%, expanding even faster than Madrid\u2019s proportion of Spain\u2019s population. In 2018-22 the region attracted about 71% of foreign investment in Spain, with the next-highest region, Catalonia, at 11%. The signal that \u201cyou are welcome\u201d is powerful for investors, says Nuria Vilanova of CEAPI, a group that promotes links with Latin America. And though Spanish universities are middling, its business schools are an exception. Madrid has campuses of three such schools that come high in global rankings."}, {"role": "second", "text": "The price of success"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The biggest problem facing Madrid is where it can put people. The region, with 7m inhabitants, is expected to add another million in the next decade. But the city lacks housing, the reason growth has gone to suburbs and dormitory towns. The newest housing developments are soulless, unwalkable places. Since a peak in 2006, new building permits have fallen by 69% in Madrid, according to Neinor, a property developer. Getting them is still onerous."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hence the hopes for Madrid Nuevo Norte, a new district around Chamart\u00edn railway station. Where five skyscrapers now stand, a host of new ones are planned by 2050, creating a new business hub. But the developers hope to avoid the fate of projects that lack shops, residents and green space. Around a third of the planned 10,500 apartments are to be affordable (and rent- or price-protected), while ground floors in many buildings are to be for small retail. But some, including Rita Maestre, the co-chair of M\u00e1s Madrid, the left-wing opposition in the city, fear the project may exacerbate the city\u2019s divisions between a rich north and far poorer south."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s such a clean city,\u201d Ms Maestre says she hears\u2014from people who know just half of it. Usera or Carabanchel in the south, with incomes per head of \u20ac11,000-12,000, get about one-third of the street-cleaning budget of the rich north, she says. If the city needed a piece of ugly infrastructure such as a dump or a water-purification facility, \u201c100% of the time\u201d it was built in the south, she says. But even the poorest areas are orderly and safe, thanks to tight-knit local communities, she argues. Those include foreign ones. Usera, with over 10,000 Chinese residents (most from a single county, Qingtian), is home to the city\u2019s bustling Chinatown."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Can the city keep its cool while changing so quickly? Internationalisation and the rapid change in demography inevitably leave some grumbling about the good old days.
