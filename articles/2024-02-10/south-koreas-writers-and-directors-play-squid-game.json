A prize of 45.6bn won ($34m) awaits the sole survivor. Working in the country\u2019s entertainment industry can feel similarly rapacious. Scriptwriters and directors fight feverishly against long odds to get their projects made. But in contrast to \u201cSquid Game\u201d, success is unlikely to be lucrative for them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Shows like \u201cSquid Game\u201d, which became Netflix\u2019s most popular offering and is said to have netted the company almost $900m, have earned the South Korean entertainment industry global accolades. Yet Hwang Dong-hyuk, its creator, says the show made him only enough \u201cto put food on the table\u201d. Yoon Je-kyoon, head of the Directors Guild of Korea, says its members earn on average 18m won a year, while writers make only about 10m. The guild, and 24 other bodies that represent South Korean creatives, are lobbying for changes to the law to ensure that they are better paid."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last year America\u2019s creative industries were paralysed by weeks-long strikes by writers over the reduced royalties, or residuals, that streaming services pay compared with television networks. South Korean creatives often get none at all. They are typically hired by a production house for a one-off fee, for which they forgo rights to any future profits from their work. Only established stars of the industry can generally insist on a better deal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The relative decline of cinema and television companies has made that negotiation harder. Writers\u2019 bargaining power was underpinned by box-office numbers and TV ratings. By contrast, creatives say, streaming services release less detailed viewership numbers. And they are increasingly the go-to source of money for big-budget productions in South Korea. In May Netflix, which claims to pay \u201cfair, highly competitive rates\u201d, promised to invest $2.5bn in South Korean content. Disney+ said in September it was hoping to \u201cgradually increase\u201d its spending in the country."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The strikes in America won writers and directors a better deal. That approach is unlikely to work in South Korea, argues Kim Byung-in, head of the Screenwriters Guild of Korea. Not only does the industry lack Hollywood\u2019s century-long union history, but South Korea\u2019s complex labour laws and the fact that creatives tend to be freelancers rather than employees make striking difficult. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "South Korean creatives are therefore fighting to change the country\u2019s copyright law, to include a \u201cright to remuneration\u201d. This would guarantee them a payout from the end-user, such as a broadcaster or streaming company, if their creations are successful. Several amendments are being considered in South Korea\u2019s parliament. Many creatives hope Yu In-chon, a former actor who became minister for culture in October, will back one of them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is opposition. The Media Platform Alliance for Copyrights Issues, an outfit that represents broadcasters and streamers, says the change would cripple the industry. Yet if pay doesn\u2019t increase, South Korean TV and cinema \u201ccould all vanish like fog\u201d, says Mr Kim. He worries that young storytellers could shift to better-paying media, such as webtoons.\u25a0"}], "id": 15}
