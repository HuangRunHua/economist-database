The event, in a Derbyshire field by the M1, brings together lovers of the Bully, a controversial breed known for its strength and propensity to attack. Darren admits his mother worries and calls the dogs \u201cvery vicious.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Egan is right to fret. Bullies are close descendants of pit-bull terriers, one of four breeds banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act of 1991. They were first imported from America roughly a decade ago. Bully XLs, the largest type, have killed eight people since 2021, including two this year. BullyWatch, a campaign that monitors the breed, claims the different variants of Bullies carried out 45% of all dog attacks this year. In one week in July Bullies killed seven other dogs. The Daily Mirror is campaigning for a ban. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Champs Camp\u2019s attendees say the pups are misunderstood. At the show, even toddlers compete in handling events. Owners gush about their dogs\u2019 gentle nature. \u201cI\u2019d put my baby\u2019s hand in his mouth,\u201d says one man. Another tells how his XL is used as a therapy dog in an old people\u2019s home. The real problem, say the attendees, is owners who cannot control their animals. Breeding is another issue. BullyWatch suggests that 97% of breeders are unlicensed. Much inbreeding takes place, with many dogs\u2019 lineages going back to a few imported animals. Most attendees support the idea of a register for owners and breeders. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bully owners and others, including the Dog Control Coalition, a lobby group of animal-welfare charities, want legislation banning specific breeds to be overturned. Instead, they say, officials should target individual dogs that act dangerously. The trouble with that argument is that some breeds, including Bullies, are by nature more aggressive, no matter the owner. Both people who were killed this year were experienced in handling dogs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A ban on Bullies is possible. In July Chris Philp, a policing minister, said it was an option. Pressure for one mounts with news of every horrible attack. This month a Pocket Bully, a smaller variety, mauled a five-year-old girl in Stockton. At Champs Camp, there was little concern that change would come soon. Your correspondent left before a promised camp fire began, encouraged by a number of delegates who had earlier shouted at him to \u201cbeat it.\u201d Sometimes, owners are more menacing than their dogs.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
