Sprung from a rock on a mythical mountain, he overcame early hardship to hone his fighting skills, learning to somersault clouds and to turn each hair on his body into a miniature version of his warrior self. With his mix of mischief and might, he resembles the Hollywood pantheon\u2019s many superheroes. But the Monkey King is different: he is more than 400 years old and comes from China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Released on Netflix on August 18th, a new animated version of \u201cThe Monkey King\u201d is full of bust-ups and slapstick, as Monkey faces down 100 demons and tries to achieve immortality. The film is the latest in a long line of adaptations of \u201cJourney to the West\u201d, the most famous novel in Chinese literature, published in 1592. Chinese children still study the book in school, and Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, was charmed by the Monkey King as a boy. He has used the character as an ice-breaker when he speaks to crowds, including most recently with a group of children in Xinjiang."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The novel is a fantastical retelling of a journey undertaken by a monk in the seventh century to find sacred Buddhist scriptures; the \u201cWest\u201d in its title refers to India, where he travelled. But the ancient story has since conquered the world. It is a rare example of successful Chinese soft power, enduring the many ups and downs in relations between China and America. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the past century the book has been adapted into more than 60 films, countless TV shows, children\u2019s books, video games, a theme park and Lego toys. In May an award-winning graphic novel, \u201cAmerican Born Chinese\u201d by Gene Luen Yang, which incorporates the myth into a tale of teen angst at an American high school, was turned into a TV series by Disney. Japan has been behind several successful adaptations, including \u201cDragon Ball\u201d, a manga version of the story that has sold millions of copies and was spun out into a gaming franchise, and \u201cMonkey\u201d, a badly dubbed television show that became popular in Britain and Australia in the 1980s. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The original novel is irreverent\u2014at one point Monkey King urinates on the Buddha\u2019s hand. It tells the story of a monk upstaged by his mischievous companions, including a pig whose ears became wings, a sulky sand monster and the famous talking monkey, also known as Sun Wukong. But with fiction considered a disreputable pastime during the Ming dynasty, the novel was published anonymously and only later ascribed\u2014with scant evidence\u2014to Wu Cheng\u2019en, a clerk\u2019s son who repeatedly failed the exam to get a government job."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As in all good storytelling, from Shakespeare to Star Wars, the ultimate fight in this story is for the protagonist\u2019s soul. Monkey King\u2019s physical journey is overlaid with a mental one. (Spoiler alert: the rebellious hero finally finds peace.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Each Monkey King retelling has served as a mirror on its times, reflecting the anxieties of its creators. Some interpretations have concentrated on the need for discipline to quell the inner voice. Others stress the democratising theme of a lowly being rising to great heights. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Flexible interpretation of the novel\u2019s message has allowed the story to thrive in Communist China, even when other aspects of traditional culture were crushed. Mao Zedong admired Monkey King, who repeatedly challenged the hierarchies of Heaven, as a \u201cwrecking ball who battles the forces of tradition\u201d, says Julia Lovell, who translated the novel into English in 2021. A stage adaptation in 1955 praised Monkey\u2019s \u201cworking-class wisdom\u201d in defeating his oppressive rulers, the court of the mythical Jade Emperor. During the Cultural Revolution some of Mao\u2019s Red Guards likened themselves to Monkey Kings, rebelling against the Party as Monkey did against the immortals."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Netflix\u2019s film offers a pseudo-Freudian version, with Monkey\u2019s self-doubt stemming from a desperate need to be loved and to belong. It will resonate with navel-gazing viewers in the West. As most versions have done, it situates the legend in a stereotyped ancient China, with wispy-bearded men, curved rooftops, pagodas and red lanterns. On-screen adaptations often feel reductionist as a result, particularly since most retell the book\u2019s first seven chapters\u2014Monkey\u2019s bid for eternal life\u2014and ignore the 93 chapters that describe the monk\u2019s journey to find the scriptures. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At first glance, Netflix\u2019s \u201cMonkey King\u201d seems like an example of a successful Chinese cultural export. The real picture is more complex. Developed as an idea by a Shanghai-based studio in collaboration with Stephen Chow, a film director in Hong Kong, and then sold to Netflix, the film was ultimately made by an American studio. (So was the recent adaptation of the graphic novel.) Though the story of a mischievous monkey has crossed borders, genres and generations, Communist China has produced few international box-office hits or stories that endure elsewhere. It took Disney to popularise the ancient Chinese folk legend of \u201cMulan\u201d, first in 1998 and then again in 2020."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s state media regularly boast about the success of new Chinese films and TV series abroad, yet in truth most are flops. \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d starring Matt Damon\u2014the most expensive film ever made in China when it came out in 2016\u2014was panned. With improvements in Chinese film-making technique, special effects and scriptwriting, many films now become blockbusters at home, but few gain traction beyond China\u2019s borders. \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u201d and \u201cHero\u201d, two Chinese-made martial arts films, performed well in the West, but that was more than 20 years ago."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of this has to do with creative constraints. Mr Xi has made clear that the primary job of film-makers is a political one: to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well\u201d. In the past five years even slightly edgy social issues have become taboo, says Chris Berry, a professor of film studies at King\u2019s College London. Propaganda, even with whizzy special effects, rarely makes great art."}, {"role": "body", "text": "An animated version of the Monkey King should be the perfect vehicle to transcend national boundaries, with no need for awkward dubbing or distractingly strange facial hair on human actors. But this \u201cMonkey King\u201d again reflects its times. Netflix is not available in China, and the streaming service has no plans to release the film on a Chinese platform. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "With geopolitical tensions between China and America rising, even this beloved cultural icon is raising hackles. Netizens in China who watched the trailer complained that the cartoon creature looked too \u201cWestern\u201d and criticised the film as yet another attempt to stereotype the \u201cmysterious power of the East\u201d. As a seventh-century monk must once have observed, there are always obstacles on a journey to the West. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 61}
