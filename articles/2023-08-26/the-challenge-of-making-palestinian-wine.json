Yet Sari Khoury is stressed: he cannot find workers to pick grapes in his vineyards. Proud owner of the Philokalia label, he is one of a handful of Palestinians in the West Bank producing wine under the trickiest of circumstances: Israel\u2019s occupation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A \u201cseparation wall\u201d between Israel proper and most of the Palestinian territory it occupies towers above Mr Khoury\u2019s cellar in Bethlehem. Mr Khoury\u2019s vineyards are hemmed in by Gush Etzion, a cluster of Jewish settlements nudging the south of the city. Constant niggles of the occupation abound."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2014 Mr Khoury gave up his job as an architect in Paris to return home to requite his passion for wine. A year later he was producing hundreds of bottles as one of the West Bank\u2019s handful of wine producers to use only indigenous grapes. Now he fills 10,000 bottles a year. The business of wine-making is testing enough at the best of times. The headaches of production under military occupation are even more painful."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Khoury is short of labourers because Palestinians can earn five times as much across the wall in Israel. And it is virtually impossible to get a permit from the Israeli authorities to expand his type of business physically. \u201cI can\u2019t even build a shed for my tools,\u201d he explains. \u201cI have to bring them with me in the car every time.\u201d Other big obstacles are the Israeli checkpoints that hamper his logistics and the scarcity of water that is guzzled by the nearby Jewish settlements. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many Israeli wineries grow European grapes that need a lot of irrigation. But the lack of water supplies for Palestinians in the West Bank means that they struggle to grow the likes of Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon. Hence Mr Khoury\u2019s focus on local varieties such as Dabouki and Jandali that need less water and can survive the baking sun."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Khoury also emphasises sustainability, but warns against growing indigenous grapes as a gimmick. \u201cI want to create the highest quality wine possible, to be judged on its merits,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my resistance,\u201d he adds, referring to Palestinian efforts to push back against the Israeli occupation.\u25a0"}], "id": 31}
