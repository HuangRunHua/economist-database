As the human-rights advocate who broke open the Jeffrey Epstein child sex-trafficking case and risked my life in Mexico, Florida and elsewhere, I can assure you that children younger than the child actress depicted in the film are abducted, exploited and sold for sex, labour and organ-harvesting on a daily basis.

In this case, hundreds of Central American children as young as nine were potential victims of the human-trafficking cartels working in Calexico and Imperial, towns in California.
