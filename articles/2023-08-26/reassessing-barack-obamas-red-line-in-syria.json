Residents of Ghouta, a Damascus suburb, told reporters that they heard a strange noise, as if someone was opening a bottle of Pepsi. A local doctor, fighting back tears, explained that many people had sought shelter underground, but the gas was heavier than air and it pooled in basements and cellars. Had they climbed the stairs instead, they would have lived. More than 1,000 people perished that night.

But it is worth revisiting that judgment. Although there is no disputing the erosion of the West\u2019s credibility over the past decade, a salvo of cruise missiles fired against Mr Assad would hardly have rescued it.

Although the term suggests that he had settled on an ultimatum after carefully weighing up his options, the president shocked his aides at a White House news conference on August 20th 2012 when, seemingly on an impulse, he spoke about the consequences if Syria used chemical weapons. Only a handful of news outlets actually reported his remarks, perhaps because officials hastily briefed that the administration remained highly unlikely to intervene in Syria."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The officials were too late.

The red-line formulation helped strengthen America\u2019s warning when Mr Assad appeared to be thinking about using nerve gas to terrorise his people. Yet, after the atrocity, the very firmness that made it a powerful threat also raised the cost of seeming to do too little. Theodore Roosevelt, America\u2019s 26th president, famously advised leaders to \u201cspeak softly and carry a big stick\u201d.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Syria had the Middle East\u2019s most advanced programme, which it had built to deter a conventional military attack by Israel. With Russia\u2019s encouragement, international help and the good offices of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), it destroyed 1,300 tonnes of weapons and precursor chemicals, 1,200 munitions and demolished 27 production facilities. Dr Koblentz points out that ten to 12 rockets had killed over 1,000 people on August 21st. Each carried around 50 litres of nerve agent weighing a little under 55kg. By comparison, he reckons, the nerve agents Syria destroyed may have weighed 1,000 tonnes\u2014enough to attack Ghouta 1,800 times over."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The record was far from perfect. Syria continued to use chlorine, including in one highly lethal attack in 2018, which Donald Trump, Mr Obama\u2019s successor, and Britain and France met with a barrage of cruise missiles. Dr Koblentz also observes that Syria held on to some nerve agent\u2014though a tiny fraction of its initial stock\u2014because Mr Assad launched three more nerve-agent attacks, though they caused much less harm than in Ghouta. In every case, Russia covered up for its ally, blaming the attacks on rebel forces.

Many countries strongly condemned Russia over its attempt to poison Sergei Skripal, a former member of the KGB living in Britain, back in 2018 and Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, in 2020 using another nerve agent called novichok. The taboo against chemical weapons remains."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet if Syria\u2019s programme was mostly dismantled and the CWC is intact, why has American credibility suffered? One answer, says Keren Yarhi-Milo, dean of Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs, is that policy choices have audiences far beyond their narrow target. In Mr Obama\u2019s case this audience was packed with people who already doubted his resolve. His tough talk over Syria\u2019s red line was overshadowed by his oft-stated desire for America to devote less of its resources to policing the Middle East\u2014and indeed the world as a whole. The United States had become bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq. The decision to \u201clead from behind\u201d in Libya to remove Muammar Qaddafi, its tyrannical president, at the behest of Britain and France had ended in chaos. Mr Obama\u2019s attempts to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme was seen as too accommodating by some leaders in Israel and the Gulf."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dr Yarhi-Milo argues that, as well as being judged on policies, leaders also acquire a \u201csignalling reputation\u201d reflecting their record of carrying out threats and honouring promises. Experts disagree about how much this reputation is worth. Some argue that foreign powers take hard-nosed decisions, based on their assessment of a leader\u2019s capabilities and interests in the moment, rather than on his or her past. However Dr Yarhi-Milo\u2019s research suggests that, in the real world, foreign powers use reputation as a guide. \u201cSomebody like Putin doesn\u2019t engage in those kinds of super-rationalist calculations,\u201d she says. \u201cThey use shortcuts. And those\u2026many times are based on their personal experience interacting with that country.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Obama\u2019s reputation strikes Mr Simon as monumentally unfair. He points out that in 2013 the former president began a massive operation to train and support rebel fighters in Syria and argues that was far more significant than a punitive strike for Ghouta would have been. Middle Eastern leaders knew about this commitment, but it does not seem to have won much credit with them. Furthermore, Mr Simon describes in his book how, since the second term of George W. Bush, every American president has sought to limit America\u2019s commitment to the Middle East. And yet the red line over Syria is nevertheless treated as a turning-point."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Looking back across a decade, Mr Obama\u2019s record shows how elusive credibility can be. Mr Obama has insisted he has no regrets. In 2016 he told the Atlantic that \u201cdropping bombs on someone to prove that you\u2019re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force\u201d. That is surely correct. When Richard Nixon bombed Cambodia and the Viet Cong in the 1970s, in the belief that developing countries would otherwise topple like dominoes, it cost a lot of lives without saving America\u2019s reputation. Furthermore, leaders such as Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, feel free to flip-flop but are still able to exert power."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even so, the success in dealing with Syria\u2019s chemical weapons has been eclipsed by the more general truth that America\u2019s position in the Middle East has weakened\u2014partly by choice. That has been thrown into relief by the rise of Islamic State in 2014 as a violent source of anarchy and chaos. It was made worse by the fact that the man who stepped in to handle Syria with Mr Obama\u2019s blessing was Vladimir Putin. He has since increased his hold over the country, derided America\u2019s pretences to act as a global policeman and sent his troops into Ukraine. The red line has stuck because it represents a powerful metaphor for America\u2019s ongoing struggles to cope with a complicated world. \u25a0"}], "id": 46}
