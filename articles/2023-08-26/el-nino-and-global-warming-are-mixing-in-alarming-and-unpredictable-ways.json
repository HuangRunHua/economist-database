The resulting accumulations of hotter- or colder-than-average water and high or low pressure in the atmosphere affect temperatures, winds and rainfall. Most of the time, the trade winds blow warm water from the central Pacific westward, towards Australia and Asia. That movement, in turn, helps draw cooler water up from the depths in the eastern Pacific, near South America. But every two-to-seven years, conditions conspire to create a vast pool of warmer-than-average surface water all the way across the Pacific, as far as South America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Peruvian fishermen named this phenomenon after baby Jesus (el ni\u00f1o Jesus in Spanish) because it tends to reach its peak around Christmas.

Meanwhile, the industrial fishing fleet, which relies on anchovetas, languishes in the harbour. Farther down the waterfront, factories that normally grind its catch into fishmeal are shuttered. No smoke billows from their chimneys; no fishy odour lingers in the air. An industry with exports of $2bn a year has been brought to a standstill."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The hiatus has contributed to an economic contraction in Peru and is likely to keep global fishmeal prices high for much of the year.

More water evaporates, which warms the upper atmosphere and fuels tropical thunderstorms. Convection carries this additional energy to colder regions to the north and south, on either side of the equator. The spinning of the Earth spreads the energy east and west, as well. The net result is a vast redistribution of heat and moisture. In climate jargon, El Ni\u00f1o is a prime example of the \u201cteleconnection\u201d of the world\u2019s weather systems.

Broadly speaking, the Amazon Basin, Australia, the Indian subcontinent, the Sahel, South-East Asia and southern Africa often suffer drier conditions; Central and East Asia, the Horn of Africa, the southern cone of South America and the southern United States tend to get wetter (see map). Sometimes, the consequences can be devastating. A relatively mild El Ni\u00f1o in 2018-19 helped to fuel some of the worst wildfires in Australia\u2019s history. The exceptionally strong El Ni\u00f1o of 2014-16 brought droughts and floods that left some 60m people around the world short of food, drove huge outbreaks of Zika virus across South America and bleached 29% of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef.

El Ni\u00f1o years typically yield milder Atlantic hurricane seasons, reducing damage to property and crops (though that may not hold this year because of unusually hot waters in the North Atlantic). El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s impacts are hugely varied, too, going far beyond fisheries and agriculture. In 2015 production at a lithium plant in northern Chile that accounted for 30% of the world\u2019s output was disrupted by heavy rain. The ensuing jitters in the lithium market were not something forecasters had predicted.

A study by researchers at the International Monetary Fund published in 2016 found that El Ni\u00f1o had little effect one way or the other. But a paper published earlier this year in Science by Christopher Callahan of Stanford University and Justin Mankin of Dartmouth College finds that the El Ni\u00f1o cycles of 1982-83 and 1997-98 permanently reduced global gdp by $4.1trn and $5.7trn respectively. The first cycle, however, coincided with a period when the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank, was raising interest rates; the second with the Asian financial crisis. In both periods, in other words, as El Ni\u00f1o unfolded, other completely unrelated factors were also curbing economic growth in emerging markets. Disaggregating the impact of these different events is extremely difficult."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All analyses, however, agree that poor countries are hit harder by El Ni\u00f1o than rich ones. Even in the IMF study that found little overall impact, big costs in the developing world were offset by higher agricultural yields in the United States in particular.

According to the latest forecast from NOAA, the American government\u2019s meteorological agency, there is a 66% chance that the current one will be \u201cstrong\u201d. The assessment rests on the rise in surface temperatures above the norm within a specific area of the Pacific known as \u201cNi\u00f1o 3.4\u201d. A 1.5\u00b0C rise constitutes a strong event; more than 2\u00b0C counts as \u201cvery strong\u201d, on a par with the biggest El Ni\u00f1os of the past century. The previous El Ni\u00f1o, in 2018-19, peaked inside Ni\u00f1o 3.4 at 0.9\u00b0C. A climatologist calls it a \u201clittle futz of an El Ni\u00f1o\u201d. The one before that, in 2014-16, spanned two winters and peaked at 2.6\u00b0C (see chart). Global average temperatures reached successive records in 2015 and 2016.

First, it arrives right on the heels of three consecutive years of La Ni\u00f1a, the inverse of El Ni\u00f1o, when winds propel warm Pacific water more strongly than usual westward, towards Asia, temporarily reducing global temperatures. The wind patterns that dominate during La Ni\u00f1a tend to push heat deeper into the ocean. Some of that heat resurfaces during subsequent El Ni\u00f1os. Three straight years of La Ni\u00f1a mean there is more heat to be released. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But it is not just La Ni\u00f1a that has been storing heat in the world\u2019s oceans. So has global warming. For decades researchers have been taking the temperature not only at the surface but also at depths of up to 2,000 metres. Since the 1990s these deeper waters have been running an ever-rising fever. Some climate researchers are wondering whether the off-the-charts surface temperatures observed in the past month or so around the world\u2019s oceans could be linked to this pelagic flu."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although El Ni\u00f1o does cause surface temperatures to rise outside the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region, that usually does not happen until much later in the year. A possible explanation of the early surge in temperatures is that some of the heat accumulated in the deep ocean is starting to resurface. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re beginning to see some of that redistribution of heat now manifesting itself,\u201d says Piers Forster of the University of Leeds in Britain."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The theory that shifting thermal dynamics within the oceans may be intensifying this El Ni\u00f1o is not yet proved, but there is no question that global warming more broadly is set to make El Ni\u00f1os worse. \u201cAs climate change unfolds, the impacts for a given El Ni\u00f1o are not the same, they\u2019re bigger,\u201d says Adam Scaife of the Met Office, Britain\u2019s meteorological agency. Global warming means the air is more charged with water, rainfall fluctuations are increasing, \u201cand therefore, a given El Ni\u00f1o with the same strength as we had in the past can dump more water or cause a bigger drought.\u201d Whereas the \u201ctriple dip\u201d La Ni\u00f1a masked some warming, making temperatures cooler than they would otherwise have been, an El Ni\u00f1o will amplify it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cI am confident that 2024 will be unprecedented in terms of global temperatures,\u201d says Dr Scaife. Currently, the planet is 1.26\u00b0C warmer than before the invention of the steam engine. As a rule of thumb, climatologists say, every degree of warming in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region during an El Ni\u00f1o temporarily adds 0.07\u00b0C to global average temperatures. A strong or very strong event could therefore push the total rise in the average temperature to 1.4\u00b0C.

In Australia alone, even the weak El Ni\u00f1o of 2019 helped to incinerate 240,000 square kilometres of bush, killing nearly 500 people, destroying thousands of homes and wiping out A$5bn ($3.5bn) of crops and livestock. This year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o is likely to be compounded by the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), a weather pattern characterised by fluctuating surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean that further accentuates dry conditions in Australia and Indonesia. Three years of heavy rains under La Ni\u00f1a, meanwhile, have boosted plant growth. Lingering moisture in the soil and plants may offer some protection. But if all that vegetation dries out, it will fuel fiercer blazes. To make matters worse, heavy rain and shortening winters have shrunk the window to carry out controlled burns, which are used to reduce the amount of fire-prone vegetation. New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, has conducted only 20% of its scheduled burn this year, according to Greg Mullins, a former fire commissioner."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Dipolar disorder"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The IOD can also reinforce the wet conditions that El Ni\u00f1o typically brings to east Africa.

As it is, India\u2019s government has declared a ban on exports of certain types of rice, in anticipation of drier-than-usual conditions while the current crop is growing.

El Ni\u00f1os have in the past driven down rice yields: in 2015-16 South-East Asia\u2019s crop declined by 15m tonnes, 7% of global stocks.

Indonesia, for example, has been snaffling up rice from Vietnam, the third-largest exporter after India and Thailand. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Wheat, too, could be in for a wild ride.

After Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year, palm oil helped make up for a dearth of sunflower oil, 75% of which is normally produced by the two adversaries.

Research collated by the World Health Organisation found that the dry conditions associated with El Ni\u00f1os across two decades boosted malaria cases in Colombia and Venezuela by more than a third. A strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 was associated with big malaria epidemics in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda.
