Ignore the Rosetta Stone; don\u2019t turn left for the Parthenon sculptures; don\u2019t be seduced by the sumptuous naked statue of Venus. Instead, head up the stairs to Room 69. Here, it is quieter. There is the usual old stuff: Greek pots; some rude Roman decorations; and a pair of wooden double doors whose brass buzzer announces, expansively, that they lead to \u201cGREEK AND ROMAN ANTIQUITIES\u201d. Press it, and no one answers. They are not likely to. Because, after a series of thefts, there are fewer antiquities behind this museum\u2019s doors than there should be. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The British Museum is in trouble. Precisely how much is not yet clear. The museum has announced a few facts: objects dating as far back as the 15th century BC, including gold jewellery and gems, are \u201cmissing, stolen or damaged\u201d. A staff member has been sacked. More details have, with archaeological painstakingness, been unearthed by others: it is said that the Museum first learnt of this in 2021; it is said Roman cameo gems are among the things stolen. This might sound small\u2014the gems are tiddly. It is not. Dr Christos Tsirogiannis, who heads a UNESCO group on antiquities trafficking at Ionian University, says this is \u201cprobably the worst case so far\u2026No one expects that to happen in a museum.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is less about pottery than principles. To lose one antiquity may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose hundreds looks as if you are a museum that cannot do its job. The museum has built its reputation\u2014and defended its collection\u2014by arguing that it looks after things well. This would imply that it can\u2019t. Paul Cartledge, emeritus professor of Greek culture at Cambridge University, thinks that is overstating it: the theft of some jewels does not mean the Parthenon sculptures are unsafe. But, he says, if this was going on for some time, \u201cHow the hell was it not noticed?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Equally: how the hell would it be? Museums are icebergs of antiquity, with the vast majority of their collections unseen. In the case of the British Museum\u2019s 8m objects, only around 1% are usually on display. As with humans, museums\u2019 \u201cone percent\u201d tends to be glamorous and noticeable: the Parthenon sculptures, the Rosetta Stone. Steal that, and it would be noticed immediately. Steal a tiny Roman cameo and most would be none the wiser. Other curators may not have even known they had it in the first place."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Until, that is, the theft becomes known, for filched art is fascinating. Some of the most famous exhibits acquired their fame less from artistic merit than because they were nicked. The Mona Lisa, until it was stolen in 1911, was little known except to art enthusiasts; it took 26 hours for the Louvre to notice it had gone. The British Museum knows this better than anyone: as a former curator once pointed out, the Parthenon sculptures became \u201cthis great icon of Western art because they were removed\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those sculptures are one reason why these thefts are so embarrassing. The sweet savour of Schadenfreude is evident in some of the comments on the thefts. The museum, says Dr Tsirogiannis, is \u201chaving a taste of their own medicine\u201d. For centuries, it has collected objects\u2014to the fury of other countries, which often claim such items were stolen. \u201cNow they find themselves being\u2026the victims of theft.\u201d Though if the museum ever gets these gems back they could put them on display.
