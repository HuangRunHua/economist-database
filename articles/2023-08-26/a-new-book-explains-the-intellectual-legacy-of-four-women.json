The country\u2019s new chancellor, Adolf Hitler, claimed arson and used it as an excuse to revoke civil liberties. For 26-year-old Hannah Arendt, toiling in an archive to collect \u201ceveryday anti-Semitic expressions\u201d, Hitler\u2019s reaction demonstrated the ruthlessness of totalitarianism. Soon she was interrogated by the secret police\u2014an experience that catalysed a long career as a scholarly observer of persecution and mob rule."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Arendt is one of four women whose lives and thoughts Wolfram Eilenberger, a philosopher, recounts in this lively book, which spans the turbulent years from 1933 to 1943 (when Hitler was staring down defeat). The others are Simone de Beauvoir, a pioneering feminist; Simone Weil, a trade-union activist who combined mysticism with a yen for social justice; and Ayn Rand, a Russia-born critic of communism who immigrated to America and later shaped the doctrine of libertarianism (although she did not identify with it)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The book is translated from German, and its original title, \u201cFeuer der Freiheit\u201d (\u201cFire of Freedom\u201d), suggests what links the quartet. They barely met, but the imminence and then eruption of European conflict stirred each to explore alternatives to political violence. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Eilenberger applauds Arendt\u2019s integrity and toughness. But, after an exciting start, she is not a vivid presence on the page. Weil is more sharply drawn\u2014squabbling with her parents\u2019 tenant, Leon Trotsky, and, as a volunteer in the Spanish civil war, scalding her feet in a pot of boiling oil. Between stints working in a factory and flights of religious ecstasy, she wrote tirelessly, hardly eating or sleeping as she crafted essays on the empty rhetoric of extremism and man\u2019s \u201cneed for roots\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rand, based in New York and distanced from Europe\u2019s turmoil, could surround herself with \u201cintellectual aristocrats\u201d and keep a journal expounding her elitism and hatred of religion. After a decade of literary obscurity\u2014her efforts included a courtroom drama play called \u201cPenthouse Legend\u201d, in which members of the audience were chosen as the jury\u2014she broke through in 1943 with her novel \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d. Marketed by her publisher as a love story set among architects, it was actually a manifesto. Readers, undeterred by terrible reviews, lapped up her paean to individualism and rationality, which became a word-of-mouth hit. Given Rand\u2019s reputation for egotism, one of the book\u2019s most memorable details is how she addresses her husband in a letter (\u201cCubby Sweet\u201d) and signs off (\u201cYour Fluff\u201d). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unlike the other three, de Beauvoir was not from a Jewish family. Nazism impinged on her less directly, and during this period she channelled much of her energy into a liaison with a fellow philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre. The couple had many lovers, who formed a \u201cnetwork of asymmetrical relationships and dependencies that eluded any kind of benevolent description\u201d, writes Mr Eilenberger. These entanglements exhausted her. But, in illustrating the ways society thwarted women\u2019s independence, they provided rich material for her masterpiece of 1949, \u201cThe Second Sex\u201d, which argues that women are sidelined by men. Her theories were so controversial that the Vatican put \u201cThe Second Sex\u201d on its list of prohibited books, but it became a seminal text of feminism, inspiring campaigners for women\u2019s rights."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In his previous book, \u201cTime of the Magicians\u201d (published in English in 2020), Mr Eilenberger wove together the lives of four male intellectuals of the 1920s, and \u201cThe Visionaries\u201d reproduces its historical sweep, snappy chapter headings and inevitable affection for the adverb \u201cmeanwhile\u201d. Sometimes he insists too firmly on the parallels between the four women\u2019s lives, whether claiming that, for each of them in 1937, \u201cthe chief source of joy\u2026was a gramophone\u201d or that a letter of Rand\u2019s \u201ccould have been committed to paper with equal aptness\u201d by any of the others."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Attempts to capture the immediacy of his characters\u2019 thoughts can sometimes result in portentousness. Weil, for example, leaps \u201cout from the ivory tower of theory, into the everyday suffering of the workers\u201d and concludes that \u201cto truly liberate humanity from this planetary nightmare, a comprehensive cultural U-turn would be necessary\u201d. But Mr Eilenberger\u2019s most valuable achievement is his focus on Weil, who died at the age of 34 in a sanatorium in Kent. In the 1950s Albert Camus declared her \u201cthe only great mind of our time\u201d, responsible for \u201ca body of work whose full impact we can as yet only guess\u201d.

Sickly and lonely yet courageous, she championed the oppressed, extolled the dignity of work and teased out the similarities between the politics of the far left and the far right.
