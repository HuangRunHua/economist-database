Keri-Lynn Wilson (pictured), a Canadian conductor of Ukrainian descent, has translated into Ukrainian the words of \u201cOde to Joy\u201d, which has been used as a protest song before, including by students in Tiananmen Square. \u201cI have never conducted before as I have with this orchestra,\u201d she says, praising the group\u2019s \u201cextraordinary intensity and intimacy\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was not only a military contest.

Others point out that cultural charm offensives do not always alter political outcomes. During the Spanish civil war in the 1930s, stars such as Pablo Picasso and the cellist Pablo Casals inspired recruits abroad and at home to the Republican cause.
