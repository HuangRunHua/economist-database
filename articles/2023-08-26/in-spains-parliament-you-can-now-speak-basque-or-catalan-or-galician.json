Espriu\u2019s stance was bold at the time. Francisco Franco\u2019s dictatorship forbade official use of any language but Castilian Spanish. But on August 17th Francina Amengol, the new president of the lower house of Spain\u2019s parliament, known as the Congress of Deputies, read the verse in Catalan in her maiden speech. Sprinkling in Basque and Galician too, she announced that the chamber would thenceforth allow use of those three languages.

On August 23rd the country\u2019s king gave Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o of the conservative People\u2019s Party the first shot at forming a new government, but he is expected to fail. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, head of the Socialist party, remains as caretaker prime minister, and still hopes to stay in power by cobbling together the support of five regional separatist parties. It was those parties that helped elect Ms Armengol (also a Socialist) to her post, and changing the language policy was part of the deal. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Armengol, a former president of the Balearic Islands, where varieties of Catalan are spoken, is a proponent of federalism for Spain, where language fights stoke intense passions: they are a proxy for old conflicts over the power of the Castilian-speaking centre versus the rest. Some find the bargain \u201cgrotesque\u201d, as a leader of the hard-right nationalist Vox party put it. They see it as rewarding separatists and supporting languages used to divide Spain."}, {"role": "body", "text": "N\u00e9stor Rego, the lone MP for the Galician Nationalist Bloc, scoffs at such views. \u201cThey can\u2019t understand that if you speak Spanish because it\u2019s your language, I speak Galician because it\u2019s mine.

Over 90% of Galicians can speak the language, but only about half do so regularly\u2014a failure of \u201cself-esteem\u201d, he says.

This is trickier. The rules let each country make one language official for EU purposes. Many states might balk at the cost, and the precedent. Other countries have minority languages too. There are already 24 official ones, and the bloc\u2019s translation services employ over 2,000 people at an annual cost of \u20ac350m ($380m), or 0.2% of its budget."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Back in Madrid it is not yet clear how the policy will work.

In his column in El Pa\u00eds, a daily, he argues against the logic that if you speak a language you are a nationalist, and therefore a separatist. The way to fight that idea is for Spanish patriots to celebrate all of the country\u2019s languages: \u201cit is a tremendous error to leave the promotion and defence of Catalan in the hands of the secessionists\u2026there is no better way to refute separatism than in Catalan.\u201d \u25a0"}], "id": 36}
