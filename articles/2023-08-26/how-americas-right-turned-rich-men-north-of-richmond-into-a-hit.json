Oliver Anthony is an unlikely star. And yet his song, \u201cRich Men North of Richmond\u201d, released on August 11th, is crowning the charts, having racked up more than 34m streams on YouTube. He is the first musician to debut in the number-one slot on the Billboard Hot 100 without having had another song in the charts before. How did an unsigned, unknown artist become the minstrel of the moment? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The song\u2019s substance helps explain its success. With the nostalgic twang of Appalachian folk, the bearded bard is singing of Americans\u2019 struggles. When Mr Anthony laments \u201cyour dollar ain\u2019t shit/And it\u2019s taxed to no end\u201d and repeats the chorus (\u201cIt\u2019s a damn shame/What the world\u2019s gotten to/For people like me/And people like you\u201d), he is speaking directly to the anger millions of listeners feel, as they struggle with inflation, high living costs and disillusionment with Washington. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Anthony is also parroting frequent complaints heard from populists on the American right, crooning that obese people use welfare funds to buy fudge and that northern elites travel to private islands to abuse minors (a reference to Jeffrey Epstein and his ties to Democratic politicians). Conservative pundits including Joe Rogan, a podcast host, and Kari Lake, an ally of Donald Trump who ran unsuccessfully for office in Arizona, praised Mr Anthony\u2019s authenticity online to their social-media followers. These endorsements helped \u201cRich Men\u201d go viral, says Jada Watson, who studies country music."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For years America\u2019s political divisions have played out on cable news. Now they are shifting to the music charts. In May Jason Aldean, a country singer, released \u201cTry That in a Small Town\u201d, a warning to urban protesters. Critics deemed the music video racist; Nikki Haley, a Republican presidential hopeful, added it to her campaign playlist; and the row drove the song to number one in early August. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Anthony maintains that he is centrist. He claims to have rejected a proposed $8m record deal, saying that he does not want to buy a private jet and tour buses, play shows at stadiums or be in the spotlight. But that will not stop conservative voters and right-wing politicians using his music as their theme song. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 64}
