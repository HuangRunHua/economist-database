America had to rally the world against Islamic State (IS), a force of Sunni Muslim jihadists who by 2016 governed an area the size of Britain and extolled their desire to conquer the world for the caliphate. But four years after a Western coalition recaptured the last redoubts of IS in Iraq and Syria, it is walking away from the clear-up. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In north-eastern Syria tens of thousands of women and children of captured jihadists are languishing in a detention camp called al-Hol. In Iraq jihadist sympathisers, their families and displaced people who had come under the sway of IS and were held in camps recently closed have fared little better. Far from being reintegrated back into society, they could still pose a threat. \u201cIraq is still fragile,\u201d says a Western diplomat in Baghdad. \u201cWithout a sustainable return, there\u2019s an increased tendency for displaced people to be pushed back into IS\u2019s extremist narrative.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The UN is handing over responsibility for them and their families to Iraq\u2019s Shia-led regime and its allied militias, who have a history of wreaking revenge on their enemies. A UN document in February said that 80% of the UN\u2019s programmes for protecting children and victims of gender-based violence were due to be closed this summer."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Up to 100,000 women and children with ties to IS fighters were quarantined after the war in al-Hol. IS commanders\u2019 wives are bundled together with girls forced into marriage. Countries like Britain refuse to take back their own citizens. Iraq has suspended repatriations from al-Hol."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The American-backed Kurdish group that rules the area is meant to control the camp, but aid-workers speak of a free-for-all. Women loyal to IS hold sway with guns and train a new generation of believers in jihadist ideology.

Inmates get out unvetted. While official repatriation proceeds at a snail\u2019s pace, al-Hol\u2019s population has fallen roughly by half, as inmates sneak away. But it still holds some 42,000 people, of whom 24,500 are reckoned to be Iraqis. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mothers fund their escape from al-Hol by selling their offspring as child soldiers to Kurdish, Sunni or Shia militias\u2014or to IS. Kitaib Hizbullah, a Shia militia in Iraq, is said to charge $3,000 for getting a prisoner out of the camp and back across the border into Iraq.

In 2019 its government promised to bring back all the Iraqis who were still held there. It opened a transit camp in Iraq called Jadda 1, south of Mosul, the biggest city the caliphate had held, to serve as a pipeline for receiving people from al-Hol and putting them back into the community. But the process has ground to a halt. Jadda 1 was meant to offer three months of rehab and trauma counselling there, but aid-workers call it \u201cIraq\u2019s Guant\u00e1namo\u201d. Inmates need security clearance and sponsors to leave it. Few meet those requirements, so many are stuck there.

Many have no home to go back to. Thousands of buildings were destroyed in the war to defeat IS, or have new occupants. The lucky ones who have recovered their homes are often badly discriminated against. \u201cWhen they go out they\u2019re harassed by their neighbours saying, \u2018You\u2019re Daesh\u2019 [the Arabic acronym for IS],\u201d says a researcher for an American institute. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such is the stigma of affiliation to IS that those returning are often threatened with death. Some have been killed. Iraqi militias which helped recapture the territory hound them away, says a UN document, or extort bribes at checkpoints. Some 1m of them now doss down in unsupervised places such as Mosul\u2019s car parks. An estimated 430,000 lack basic documents. Iraq\u2019s authorities are reluctant to recognise marriage, birth and death certificates issued by IS. Local officials require women to disavow their IS husbands, even if they are widows, to get clearance. This all makes it hard for them to find jobs and health care, go through checkpoints, or register children at school."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some UN officials, explaining why the world body has stopped overseeing the return process, say that Iraq should take over responsibility because it is flush with oil. This year it has a budget of $150bn.
