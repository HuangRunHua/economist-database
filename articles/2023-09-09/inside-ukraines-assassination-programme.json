Yevhen Yunakov, the mayor of Velykyi Burluk, in the Kharkiv region, had been identified as a collaborator with the Russians. \u201cCaucasus\u201d, a special-forces commander, and a group of local officers were given the job. His men watched their target meticulously for days: when he shopped; when and where he moved; the extent of his security. Once they detonated their bomb, from a distance, they disappeared to safe-houses inside occupied territory. The group would return to Ukrainian-controlled territory only weeks later, after the town had been liberated. Yunakov\u2019s body has never been found.

They have been shot, blown up, hanged and even, on occasion, poisoned with doctored brandy. Ukraine is tight-lipped about its involvement in assassinations. But few doubt the increasingly competent signature of its security services. The agencies themselves drop heavy hints. \u201cAny person who betrays Ukraine, shoots at Ukrainians or fires missiles on Ukrainians should understand that they are being watched and will be brought to justice,\u201d says Andriy Cherniak, an officer of HUR, Ukraine\u2019s military-intelligence agency.

In fact, the origins of political assassination are a little closer to home. Mossad learned much of its craft from the Soviet-era secret police and its founding practitioner, Pavel Sudoplatov, who was born in Melitopol in now-occupied southern Ukraine. In a quirk of history, Sudoplatov spent the 1930s infiltrating Ukrainian nationalist groups, and personally blew up one of their leaders with a chocolate-box bomb. (He also masterminded the assassination of Leon Trotsky in 1940.)

A former officer of the directorate describes it in similar terms. \u201cWe needed to bring war to them.\u201d In 2015 and 2016 the directorate was linked to the assassinations of key Russian-backed commanders in the Donbas; Mikhail Tolstykh, aka \u201cGivi\u201d, killed in a rocket attack; Arsen Pavlov, aka \u201cMotorola\u201d, blown up in a lift; Alexander Zakharchenko, blown up in a restaurant (pictured).

The SBU\u2019s relative size and budget\u2014five times bigger than HUR\u2019s\u2014mean it has been most able to pull off the most sophisticated jobs, for example bombing the Kerch bridge, linking Russia to Crimea, in October 2022. Others, though, emphasise the role of HUR, with its underground networks and increased wartime prominence. \u201cWe are mostly the white-collar guys,\u201d insists an SBU source. Another increasingly important player in occupied Ukraine is the Special Operations Forces (SSO). This is a relatively new group that co-ordinates Rukh Oporu (Resistance Movement), Ukraine\u2019s partisans. The operation in Kharkiv, for example, was the SSO\u2019s. Denys Yaroslavsky, an officer in the SSO, says the service is now pushing for more powers to \u0441onduct operations within Russia itself.
