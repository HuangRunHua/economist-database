The president said the defence ministry needed a new approach, not least in tackling the corruption that has plagued military contracts (Mr Reznikov is not implicated in any of the allegations). Rustem Umerov was named as the new minister. As head of the State Property Fund Mr Umerov has a record of rooting out graft. He is also a Tatar from Crimea.

Spain has been in political limbo since an election in July, which was won by the opposition People\u2019s Party but without a majority in parliament. The pp will try to form a government this month. If it fails, as is likely, the Socialists may be asked to try, or a new election could be called."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court decriminalised abortion across the country.

Britain\u2019s second-largest city is not alone in its financial struggles; nearly half of England\u2019s councils will have to cut spending on services.
