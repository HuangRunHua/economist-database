The longest-running measure comes from a survey by University of Michigan, which began in 1946. Each month it asks a representative sample of 600 Americans a set of five questions probing their opinions on their own finances and spending, the state of the wider economy, and the outlook for both. For most of the past four decades the index has moved in lock-step with changes in current consumer spending, and also loosely predicted spending a year ahead."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Economists worry that current economic pessimism will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Although a despondent public would have been a grave warning sign before the pandemic, since 2020 the mix of economic indicators that shape sentiment has changed, and as a result the measure has lost its predictive power."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first study highlighting this pattern was published last month on X (formerly Twitter) by a researcher using the handle \u201cquantian1\u201d, who chose to remain anonymous. Extending this analysis, we built a statistical model to predict the monthly consumer-sentiment index between 1980 and 2016 using a broad battery of economic data. A combination of 13 variables, including inflation, unemployment and petrol prices explained 86% of the variation in the index in this period, a very good fit."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230909_WOF920.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1432.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Before the pandemic, the relationships between these indicators and consumer sentiment were relatively stable. When tested on data from 2017-19, the model trained on the 1980-2016 period reliably predicted sentiment, with only small errors. However, covid seems to have severed this link, making the model\u2019s projections wildly inaccurate.

In contrast, since covid began, the correlation between sentiment and both current and future spending has vanished."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230909_WOF921.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1642.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Our results should assuage concerns that a vibecession today spells a recession tomorrow.
