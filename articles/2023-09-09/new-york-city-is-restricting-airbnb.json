Years after many cities (including Boston, Paris, San Francisco and Sydney) began implementing laws limiting rental days and slapping fines on violators, the Big Apple is following suit. A new municipal law requires hosts of short-term rentals of less than 30 days to register with New York City. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The city also requires that hosts be present during the stay and guests must have full access to the entire home. Lisa Grossman, a former short-term-rental host in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, a Manhattan neighbourhood, calls the new law a \u201croommate set-up\u201d, where neither the guest nor the host has privacy. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting somebody into my home,\u201d she says. \u201cI walk around in my underwear.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hosts say the rules are stringent (Paris\u2019s regulations stretch to 120-day rentals) and the registration process onerous. According to Skift, a travel news site, only 3,800 (roughly 16% of previously active listings) have applied as of September 4th and only 290 have been approved. Some are worried they will lose their homes without the added income from short-term renters. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Airbnb, which filed an unsuccessful legal challenge, calls the law a \u201cde facto ban\u201d. It says New York City\u2019s new rules are an outlier and a contrast with the approach in places like San Diego and Seattle. Airbnb has weathered restrictions before. New regulations removed 10,000 listings from Amsterdam in 2021. After new rules were enforced in 2021, Sydney lost 6,000 listings. Tokyo saw 14,000 listings removed starting in 2018. Around 80% of its top 200 markets by revenues globally have some sort of regulation in place, the firm says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The law\u2019s proponents say it will stamp out illegal rentals, which contribute to the city\u2019s shortage of affordable housing. Murray Cox of Inside Airbnb, an Airbnb watchdog, argues that short-term lets are \u201cpotentially displacing the people that used to live there. Sometimes people were evicted.\u201d Others argue that they make neighbourhoods worse. Vijay Dandapani, of the Hotel Association of New York City (which has an interest in squishing Airbnb), said \u201cI live in a condo. I can tell you I don\u2019t want people coming in at 1am.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Airbnb may not be the neighbourhood killer some claim.

New York will have to look for other ways to fix its housing problems.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 23}
