They are advised to consider declining even gifts valued at less than $20 that might prompt a reasonable person to \u201cquestion the employee\u2019s integrity or impartiality\u201d.

The only ethical requirements that apply to America\u2019s nine most powerful jurists are found in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, an anti-corruption law passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The law requires public officials to disclose in an annual report certain information about their investments, outside income (currently capped at $30,000 a year for teaching, but unlimited when it comes to books) and gifts. It also requires some financial data related to the justices\u2019 immediate family."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In June ProPublica, an investigative outlet, reported that in 2008 Justice Samuel Alito omitted to log a trip on a private jet to Alaska that was paid for by a billionaire Republican donor who would later bring cases to the Supreme Court. In April ProPublica published details that Harlan Crow, a billionaire property developer, collector of memorabilia and noted donor to conservative causes, had been hosting Justice Clarence Thomas on his plane and yacht for decades. The website later reported that Mr Crow bought a home Justice Thomas owned in Georgia and paid private-school tuition for his great-nephew.

He has now put on record his sale to Mr Crow in 2014 of the home where his 94-year-old mother continues to live.

(The exclusion refers to \u201cfood, lodging or entertainment\u201d from friends but does not mention transport.)

Justices Alito and Thomas are using \u201cnarrow and private\u201d understandings of the rules \u201cto justify their omissions\u201d.

For conservatives, bills requiring the justices to adopt a code of conduct\u2014such as the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act of 2023, sponsored by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island\u2014are sour grapes from liberals depressed about the court\u2019s rightward turn.
