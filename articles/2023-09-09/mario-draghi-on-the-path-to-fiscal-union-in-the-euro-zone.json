That question has stalked the euro zone since its creation. Designed explicitly to exclude fiscal transfers, the currency bloc was considered by many economists to be doomed even before it was launched. It survived an existential crisis in 2010-12 only with stopgap solutions, and it is no closer to answering this question today. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet, paradoxically, the prospects for fiscal union in the euro zone are improving\u2014because the nature of the needed fiscal integration is changing. Fiscal union is typically seen as entailing transfers from thriving regions to those going through economic slumps, and in Europe public opposition to stronger countries supporting weaker ones remains fierce. But this type of federal \u201cstabilisation\u201d policy has become less relevant. The euro zone has evolved in two ways that are opening up a different, and potentially more acceptable, road to fiscal union. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "First, since 2012 the European Central Bank has developed policy tools to contain unwarranted divergence between stronger and weaker countries\u2019 borrowing costs, and shown its willingness to use them. This has enabled national fiscal policies\u2014which play a crucial stabilising role in the euro zone\u2014to smooth the economic cycle. That, in turn, makes cross-border fiscal transfers less necessary. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Second, Europe is no longer mainly facing crises caused by unsound policies in particular countries. Instead, it has to confront common, imported shocks like the pandemic, the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine. These shocks are too large for countries to handle on their own. Consequently, there is less opposition to addressing them through common fiscal action. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Europe\u2019s response to the pandemic acknowledged this new reality: a \u20ac750bn ($810bn) fund was set up to help EU member states address the green and digital transitions. And a necessary political condition for the EU\u2019s fiscal framework to develop along more federal lines is that countries receiving these funds use them successfully. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Europe must now confront a host of supranational challenges that will require vast investments in a short time frame, including defence as well as the green transition and digitisation. As it stands, however, Europe neither has a federal strategy to finance them, nor can national policies take up the mantle, as European fiscal and state-aid rules limit the ability of countries to act independently. This contrasts starkly with America, where Joe Biden\u2019s administration is aligning federal spending, regulatory changes and tax incentives in the pursuit of national goals. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Without action, there is a serious risk that Europe underdelivers on its climate goals, fails to provide the security its citizens demand and loses its industrial base to regions that impose fewer constraints on themselves. For this reason, sliding back passively into its old fiscal rules\u2014which were suspended during the pandemic\u2014would be the worst possible outcome. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Europe therefore has two options. One is to relax its fiscal and state-aid rules, allowing member states to shoulder the full burden of the necessary investment. But as fiscal space in the euro zone is not evenly distributed, such an approach would be fundamentally wasteful. Shared challenges like climate and defence are binary: either all countries achieve their common goals or none does. If some countries can use their fiscal space but others cannot, then the impact of all spending is lower, as none are able to achieve climate or military security. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second option is to redefine the EU\u2019s fiscal framework and decision-making process to make them commensurate with our shared challenges. As it happens, the European Commission has tabled a proposal for new fiscal rules while, with further EU enlargement on the table, the time is apt to consider such changes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fiscal rules should be both strict, to ensure governments\u2019 finances are credible over the medium term, and flexible, to allow governments to react to unforeseen shocks. The current set of rules is neither, leading to policies that are too loose in booms and too tight in busts. The European Commission\u2019s proposal would go a long way towards addressing such procyclicality. But even if fully implemented, it would not fully resolve the trade-off between strict rules\u2014which need to be automatic to be credible\u2014and flexibility. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This can be resolved only by transferring more spending powers to the centre, which in turn makes possible more automatic rules for the member states. That is broadly the situation in America, where an empowered federal government sits alongside largely inflexible fiscal rules for the states, which are mostly prohibited from running deficits. Balanced-budget rules are credible\u2014with the ultimate sanction of default\u2014precisely because the federal level takes care of the bulk of discretionary spending. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Europe were to federalise some of the investment spending needed for today\u2019s shared goals, it could achieve a similar balance. Federal borrowing and spending would lead to greater efficiency and more fiscal space, as aggregate borrowing costs would be lower. National fiscal policies could then be more focused on reducing debt and building up buffers for bad times. More automatic fiscal rules would become feasible, and member states could credibly fail. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such reforms would mean pooling more sovereignty, and would therefore require new forms of representation and centralised decision-making. But as the EU enlarges to include the Balkans and Ukraine, these two agendas will naturally come together. We will need to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past by expanding our periphery without strengthening the centre, otherwise we risk diluting the EU rather than empowering it to act. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "More centralised decision-making will, in turn, require the consent of European citizens in the form of a revision of EU treaties\u2014something that European policymakers have shied away from since the failed referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005. Today, as we move towards the European elections in 2024, this prospect looks unrealistic as many citizens and governments oppose the loss of sovereignty treaty reform would entail. But the alternatives are unrealistic as well. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The strategies that ensured Europe\u2019s prosperity and security in the past\u2014reliance on America for security, on China for exports and on Russia for energy\u2014have become insufficient, uncertain or unacceptable. In this new world, paralysis is clearly untenable for citizens, whereas the radical option of exiting the EU has delivered decidedly mixed results. Forging a closer union will ultimately prove to be the only way to deliver the security and prosperity that European citizens crave. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mario Draghi was prime minister of Italy from February 2021 to October 2022 and president of the European Central Bank from 2011 to 2019."}], "id": 11}
