The country has the third-highest murder rate and the highest unemployment rate in the world. Graft has corroded the shine of the ruling African National Congress. Nearly three decades on from April 1994, when millions queued to elect Nelson Mandela, most people will probably stay at home when the country votes in next year\u2019s general election."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In spite\u2014and often because\u2014of the woes, there is plenty to laugh about, too. And few comedians make South Africans chortle more than Trevor Noah (pictured), whose career began in the clubs of his home town, Johannesburg, before he became the host of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d, an American television programme. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On August 30th Mr Noah began a 12-show tour of South Africa. (Afterwards he will travel to India, the United Arab Emirates, America and Britain, finishing in March next year.) He symbolises the role comedians can play in South Africa, a country of many nations\u2014merchants of mirth, but also translators across divides."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Under apartheid, comedy, like all culture, was subject to heavy regulation. Long opposed by the government, television was not introduced until 1976. When it finally came, whites were fed milquetoast fare. Comedians who tried to slip in unscripted jokes were kept off-air for years. State-sponsored \u201cAfrican\u201d shows depicted the supposedly wacky ways of \u201ctribal\u201d life to emphasise blacks\u2019 otherness. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In its dying days apartheid was satirised by a few white stand-ups. One of them, Casper de Vries, says he \u201cwanted to rebel against my conservative culture\u201d, which made him the target of an assassination plot by far-right extremists. But after the end of apartheid in 1994, opportunities for black stars and the exuberance of the democratic era created a culture where all comedians were \u201ctrying to find a common understanding\u201d, says Mr de Vries. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Noah has argued that comedy contributed to catharsis; it was much easier to break taboos while laughing at them. Black comedians frequently mock their audiences. \u201cDo white people know where Gugulethu is?\u201d asked Loyisa Gola, a popular comic, in one of his routines, referring to the poor part of Cape Town where he grew up. \u201cWell, you should know, you put us there, motherfuckers.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Comedy is a way for different people to understand each other, says Ndumiso Lindi, another comedian. \u201cComedians bring out things that other people don\u2019t see,\u201d he adds. It helps that South Africans can laugh at themselves. His skit about the reaction of white suburbanites to the arrival of an upwardly mobile black family\u2014and their cows\u2014mocks both the curtain-twitching of whites and stereotypes of his ethnic group, Xhosas. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Noah is perhaps the ultimate comic interpreter. The son of a Xhosa mother and a Swiss father, he was \u201cBorn a Crime\u201d, as declared by the title of his bestselling memoir, published in 2016. Not quite black, not quite white and not quite \u201cColoured\u201d\u2014a term South Africans use to describe mixed-race people whose primary language is Afrikaans\u2014he grew up something of an outsider. Languages helped him survive: he speaks seven of South Africa\u2019s 12 official languages, as well as German. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Noah also entered the industry when there was little alternative to shows in English. Today the rise of \u201cvernacular\u201d comedy reflects the growth of a non-white middle class, eager for shows in their mother tongues. Many of the most popular comedians in South Africa mix \u201cvernac\u201d and English shows, a blend they say hones their craft. Virgil Prins, who speaks English, Afrikaans and Xhosa, notes that whites are impatient for punchlines; black audiences enjoy the journey as much as the destination. \u201cThe way white people receive humour and express humour is very different to how the black or vernac audiences do,\u201d he argues. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Vernac can involve stereotyping. This is not unlike that common gag in Britain that begins, \u201cAn Englishman, an Irishman and Scotsman walk into a bar.\u201d Instead, in the South African version, it is a Pedi, a Zulu and a Xhosa walking into a shebeen, or a speakeasy. According to Mashabala Galane, a pioneer of vernac, Pedis are frequently mocked for being mummy\u2019s boys, Zulus for their aggressiveness and Xhosas for their pretensions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet vernac shows help comedians confront taboos beyond race and take aim at many sensitive subjects. These include sex\u2014\u201cwhich we don\u2019t normally talk about as black people\u201d, says Mr Galane\u2014as well as traditional medicine and polygamy, still practised by some Zulus. (A bonus is more material for mother-in-law jokes.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Noah has said that satire is important in a country where politics is one of the few shared experiences. But \u201cvernac comedians don\u2019t normally touch politics,\u201d says Mr Galane: \u201cPeople come to comedy to escape politics.\u201d This means that one consequence of the growth of vernac may be that South African comedy loses some of its political potency."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That hints at a broader apathy after almost 30 years of unmet expectations. Or perhaps it is just hard to satirise public life when so many South African politicians are unwitting comedians. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president, nearly resigned last year in a scandal involving $580,000 in cash stuffed in a sofa from the sale of buffaloes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The state of the economy does not make it easy for comedians to follow in Mr Noah\u2019s footsteps either. For most South Africans, shelling out the equivalent of $50 for a comedy ticket would be an absurd luxury. Covid led to the closure of the last comedy club still standing in Cape Town. To make an income, many comics take corporate gigs, playing at firms\u2019 bashes. According to Mr Lindi, \u201cThey come with rules, like no race jokes. But how do you avoid race issues in a country like ours?\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 69}
