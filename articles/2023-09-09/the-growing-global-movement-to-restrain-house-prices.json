The suit revealed that Flannery had committed to buying 140 properties for a total of more than $800m and was paying well over the market odds: as much as $15,000 per acre, for land valued to tax authorities for as little as a tenth of that. The entire scheme spans 50,000 acres, an area far larger than that of San Francisco proper."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Who would be willing to pay so much for seemingly so little? On August 25th the New York Times revealed that the formerly anonymous owners of Flannery Associates include almost a dozen Silicon Valley titans.

The secretive plans for a new city in Solano County are just one of the more outlandish strands of Yimbyism\u2014a growing movement that says yes, not no, to development."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yimbys argue that housing shortages are caused largely by laws that control who can build what and where. Zoning and planning laws, they say, are so strict that building new housing is in many places completely illegal, and in almost all it is slow, difficult and expensive.

In places like California and London, wages are far higher than elsewhere in America and Britain, and have risen faster in the past decade. But for workers who do not own property, the gains are eaten up by higher rents (see chart 2). Findings published in January by the National Bureau of Economic Research show that for workers with degrees, although living in a big coastal American city comes with a substantial wage premium, a higher cost of living means that overall they are about as well off as if they lived in a poorer city. Lower-skilled workers are much worse off, which means they move out to make space. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "California\u2019s Yimbys point to a broken system.

The number of homes that have actually been built to date means that the target looks wildly out of reach. Other laws passed by Mr Wiener and his allies have extended rights to homeowners to build \u201caccessory dwelling units\u201d, or granny flats, and have restricted mandates that force developers to provide masses of free parking in new buildings."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the higher levels of politics at least, Yimbyism is now practically mainstream in California. \u201cPro-housing policies are pro-job policies,\u201d tweeted London Breed, San Francisco\u2019s mayor, in July. Gavin Newsom, the state\u2019s governor, promised to build 3.5m homes in a speech for his election campaign. Across the state such politicians are engaged in an increasingly pitched legislative battle with local politicians, such as city council members and the leaders of suburbs, who are generally determined not to build more."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yimbyism abounds elsewhere, too. In New York this year Kathy Hochul, the state governor, (unsuccessfully) proposed a radical \u201cupzoning\u201d, approving a greater density of housing in a particular area.

The problem, says Brian Hanlon, a co-founder of California Yimby, a pro-housing pressure group, is that \u201cwe are all inheritors of this English town-planning system, which is disastrous\u201d. In Britain the first extensive regulation of landowners\u2019 rights to build on their property was introduced with the Town Planning Act in 1909 and then expanded dramatically in 1947 with the Town and Country Planning Act. In America \u201czoning\u201d laws were passed in most urban areas in the 1920s and 1930s. \u201cWhen Ireland got independence, we practically copied everything Great Britain did,\u201d says Robert Tolan, a housing economist in Dublin. That included Ireland\u2019s own version of the planning act in 1963.

For urban planners, such as Ebenezer Howard, density was seen as akin to crowding. In packed industrial hotspots, \u201cdownzoning\u201d and slum clearance were used to flatten cities and spread them out by force. The writer George Orwell was sceptical of the proceedings: \u201cIf people are going to live in large towns at all they must learn to live on top of one another,\u201d he declared. But he reckoned that many workers in Britain did not \u201ctake kindly to flats\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today far fewer citizens of English-speaking countries live in flats than elsewhere. In England 80% of people now dwell in houses, and just 6% in flats in buildings taller than three storeys. In France 44% of people live in apartments, as opposed to houses. In cities including Dublin, Los Angeles and Sydney, sprawl is running out of road. At the densities allowed by law, almost all of the land within a reasonable commute of city centres has already been \u201cbuilt out\u201d. Instead, new subdivisions are built in separate towns, perhaps 50 or 60 miles away from the core, with residents typically facing punishing commutes by car to work.

But homes sold for roughly twice that. In southern England an acre of agricultural land might cost as much as \u00a315,000 ($19,000). An acre with planning permission is worth at least 60 times that. What this means is that giving permission to developers to build creates vast amounts of value by the stroke of a pen. And yet it doesn\u2019t happen, largely because, through the planning system, local residents and political groups are generally able to block any development. Rules intended to regulate development, such as environmental reviews, design consultations, parking requirements and so on, in fact serve the purpose of stopping it."}, {"role": "second", "text": "House of bricks"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nimbyism has plenty of origins.

The city, which is wedged in between Berkeley and Oakland, about half an hour from downtown San Francisco, proposes to allow the construction of 3,687 new homes over the next eight years.

The number of new homes that got permission to be built went up from 2,500 to 15,000 between 2010 and 2021. Of course, like many other countries, New Zealand was dealing with the effects of the global financial crisis back in 2010. But all over the city, smart blocks of flats that can fit many inhabitants have quickly replaced fading 1960s detached houses.
