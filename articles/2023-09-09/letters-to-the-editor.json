In my involvement with the AIIB as a member of the International Advisory Panel for the past few years and my interactions with its president, Jin Liqun, and other senior officers and staff, I have observed a professional, transparent, open, well-governed and forward-thinking organisation with a very diverse and international group of managers.

In my experience, President Jin and the AIIB management were always receptive to the advice and recommendations of the advisory panel. President Jin is very well regarded and respected in the international financial community. He is a professional and a strong advocate of good governance.

This perspective fails to focus on the core purpose of the AIIB, to foster and support sound infrastructure investment and to make substantial contributions to the lives of millions across Asia and beyond. In less than eight years the AIIB has emerged as a significant player in the development-finance landscape. With 106 members and financing for over 200 infrastructure projects amounting to almost $44bn, its impact is undeniable. Its independence, efficiency, collaboration across multilateral development banks and commitment to sustainability are evident in its operations and outcomes.
