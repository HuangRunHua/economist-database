Over black coffee with five spoonfuls of sugar, Mr Milei outlines his libertarian beliefs and explains how he would make Argentina, one of the world\u2019s most economically vexed nations, \u201cgreat again\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "When speaking about his political philosophy, Mr Milei has the air of an eccentric academic rather than an aspiring president.

Extending this logic, Mr Milei describes the state as \u201ca criminal organisation\u201d. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t pay taxes voluntarily,\u201d he says, \u201cyou pay them at gunpoint.\u201d He thinks the welfare state must be dismantled because it transfers the costs of decisions to others, rather than making individuals responsible for their actions. Traditional libertarian principles, such as unfettered immigration and the legalisation of illegal drugs are \u201cmarvellous\u201d only in the absence of a welfare state. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet as someone who hopes to be the next head of state, Mr Milei says he accepts \u201cthe restrictions of real life\u201d. Whereas Mr Milei says he subscribes to anarcho-capitalism philosophically, in practice he is a \u201cminarchist\u201d, a softer strand of libertarian anarchism in which the state\u2019s only function is to provide citizens with the army, the police, and the courts in order to enforce property rights. He says that creating such a limited state would take decades."}, {"role": "body", "imageURL": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dUghhK8YBvA", "imageWidth": 640.0, "imageHeight": 360.0, "imageDescription": "", "text": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "First, pro-market reforms would whittle down the size of the state. Mr Milei proposes cutting public spending by at least 15% of GDP and reaching zero primary deficit (ie, before interest payments) within his first year of government. He would do this by eliminating electricity and gas subsidies, cutting the number of government ministries from 18 to eight, replacing state spending on public works with a private bidding system, reducing federal transfers to Argentina\u2019s 24 provinces, and scrapping privileged pensions paid to Supreme Court justices, diplomats and presidents. He promises to renounce his presidential pension. He will try to privatise all of Argentina\u2019s 34 state companies, and to reduce or scrap most of Argentina\u2019s taxes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Next, services that are usually provided by the state, such as education and health care, would see increasing doses of competition. A voucher system would be introduced in education, in which parents are given resources to decide where to send their children rather than the state transferring funds to schools. Proposals on health care are thin, but Mr Milei says public provision would move towards an insurance-based model. Both education and health care are governed by Argentina\u2019s provinces, so in practice the extent of changes the federal government could make is limited. Surprisingly, Mr Milei says he would leave welfare payments untouched until fiscal and labour reforms have made Argentina more competitive. Trade unions are also \u201cnot a problem\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Milei\u2019s grandest proposal is to dollarise Argentina\u2019s economy. Emilio Ocampo, Mr Milei\u2019s chief dollarisation strategist, acknowledges that the country needs to have access to a pool of greenbacks in order to dollarise. He argues some of these would come from Argentines repatriating the hundreds of millions of dollars they hold abroad or pumping dollars held under the mattress back into the system. Mr Ocampo has also proposed creating a special-purpose fund in an OECD jurisdiction which would include treasury bonds, debt from the public pension fund and shares in the state oil firm. Using this as collateral to borrow against the fund is one option for raising cash. But Mr Milei says his team is looking at five alternatives that will depend on the state of the market come December, when the new government takes power. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Paint it, libertarian"}, {"role": "body", "text": "All these proposals, says Mr Milei, would be sent to Congress rather than implemented by presidential decree. He says he will turn to referendums only if Congress rejects his proposal of eliminating the central bank and cutting down the size of other parts of the state.

Since 2018, when Argentina agreed a mammoth $44bn loan with the IMF, it has struggled to pay back regular instalments. It is difficult to see how it will be able to attract the $40bn Mr Milei says are needed to dollarise, especially given that he wants to do so within two years. Mr Milei is banking on the markets responding favourably to a potential victory. But after he won Argentina\u2019s primaries on August 13th, the peso lost almost a fifth of its value, partly because of fears that it would be hard for him to govern with a minority in Congress (see chart 1). He dismisses talk of ungovernability as claptrap invented by the opposition.

According to the latest official data, from 2021, public spending in Argentina represented 38% of GDP, of which two-thirds went on social expenditure such as education and health. Given the long transition that will be required to change the education and health-care systems, and the relatively small share of spending taken up by privileged pensions, some economists believe that Mr Milei will struggle to cut public spending by more than 5% of GDP during his four-year term, if he were to win. It may also be difficult to eliminate subsidies, which cost around 2% of GDP, without some form of backlash. Annual inflation is currently 113% (see chart 2). Scrapping subsidies would push up prices further, at least temporarily, and could hurt the poor.

He also appears to think that Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s left-wing successor, was behind protests in which thousands of bolsonaristas stormed government buildings in Bras\u00edlia, the capital, demanding a coup.
