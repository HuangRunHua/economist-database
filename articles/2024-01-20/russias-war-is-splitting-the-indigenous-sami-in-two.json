The indigenous people has been pushed north by settlers and pulled south by economics. They now number just 70,000, a small share of the population of the Sapmi, their ancestral homeland, which stretches across Scandinavia and the Kola peninsula. Now Russian aggression has split them in two."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022, border closings have cut off Russian Sami from their kin in Norway, Sweden and Finland. This winter Finland shut its border after influxes of migrants, leaving Norway\u2019s Storskog the only open crossing from Russia to the EU. Some visa agreements have been cancelled. Russian-registered cars are banned."}, {"role": "body", "text": "States have often conflicted with indigenous peoples\u2019 conceptions of space. Reindeer husbandry, central to Sami culture, has long been hampered by borders. Last August, Russia demanded $4.4m from Norway\u2019s government after 42 Norwegian-owned reindeer wandered into its territory to graze.

Russia has stopped taking part in the Barents Euro-Arctic Council and the Arctic Council, two regional bodies. The International Sami Council suspended co-operation with its Russian members in April 2022 after its Russian vice-president was filmed playing a guitar marked with a Z, a symbol of support for Russia\u2019s war.

In 2012 the state shut down the association of northern indigenous peoples, then let it reopen with a head from the ruling party. Russia\u2019s foreign-agents law has stifled cross-border communication, says Silje Karine Muotka, president of the Norwegian Sami Council. Indigenous men are disproportionately recruited to the army. Andrei Danilov, a Russian Sami activist seeking asylum in Norway, says that Sami hunters and fishermen are classified as jobless by the state, which can then conscript them more easily."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All of this has serious consequences for the Sami. Cross-border political organising and cultural preservation projects have been suspended. But above all, the impact is personal. \u201cWe are suffering from being separated from our family,\u201d says Mr Mikaelsson. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 38}
