Smiling as brightly as her ally, she reeled off a list of policy objectives before warning that America could not hope to move forward with either Joe Biden or Donald Trump as president. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it if you\u2019ve got two 80-year-olds as the choice of where we\u2019re gonna go,\u201d she said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is the essence of her argument as Ms Haley tries, after Mr Trump\u2019s thumping victory in the Iowa caucus, to block his march back to the Republican nomination. Ms Haley came in a close third there to Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, but both were out of hailing range of Mr Trump. The next day, her campaign began running a new advertisement in New Hampshire saying that Mr Trump and Mr Biden were America\u2019s most disliked politicians, \u201cconsumed by chaos, negativity and grievances of the past\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the paradox of Ms Haley\u2019s candidacy is that although she looks like the party\u2019s future she, more than Mr Trump, can sound like its past. While Mr Trump continues to revise Republicanism, Ms Haley wants to return the party to its pre-Trump principles, to when it at least made a more substantial pretence of caring about cutting debt, reforming entitlement programmes and containing Russia, not to mention being polite and not getting indicted. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though Mr Trump may have stolen Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign slogan (\u201cLet\u2019s make America great again\u201d), he has otherwise shown little deference to the values Reagan laid down. In a sign of how Mr Trump has upended the party, and of his lingering anxiety about Ms Haley, he is running an ad in New Hampshire attacking her as wanting to cut Social Security, traditionally the kind of thing Democrats say Republicans are out to do."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is a whiff of nostalgia in the very way Ms Haley is campaigning, not just in her commitment to retail politics but in the company she keeps. In 1988 another Governor Sununu\u2014John, this Sununu\u2019s father\u2014rescued George H.W. Bush after he came in third in Iowa, delivering a victory that propelled him to the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re copying a few pages out of that playbook,\u201d Mr Sununu acknowledges, after snagging a chocolate bar from one of Chutters\u2019s giant jars. \u201cBut only in that it\u2019s tried and true.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He argues that his state\u2019s politics still depend on activating networks in towns such as Littleton, and that if Ms Haley, whom he endorsed last month, beats Mr Trump in New Hampshire, and then in her home state of South Carolina, \u201ceverything would flip upside down on him very, very quickly.\u201d That is a very long shot but somehow, borne along on Mr Sununu\u2019s stream of enthusiastic patter, it starts to sound more than barely plausible."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Sununu, who is 49, has been elected to four consecutive two-year terms, most recently by more than 15 points, in a state whose two senators and two representatives are all Democrats. In his party he is a relative moderate on social issues, including abortion rights, but he boasts of being the most fiscally conservative governor in the country. He has little patience with the argument that Mr Trump has fundamentally changed the Republican Party, insisting he has merely hijacked it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Sununu thinks the anger of Americans over the failures of \u201celitists in Washington\u201d, rather than any policies, led them to support Mr Trump in 2016 as a disrupter, and now as a victim. \u201cHe provides no leadership, no guidance, no basis in the Republican fundamentals of being fiscally conservative or limited government, or any of that,\u201d Mr Sununu says. \u201cHis unique skill is making people feel like he\u2019s sharing their troubles and chaos, right?\u201d But Mr Trump is \u201cusing their anger for his own personal benefit. He\u2019s not going to help them, at all. He didn\u2019t before.\u201d He fears a Republican wipeout at other levels of government if Mr Trump is re-elected."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He predicts that once Mr Trump leaves the scene\u2014after a Haley victory, or further down the road\u2014the old dynamics in the party will reassert themselves, \u201cwith no one individual trying to redefine where the party goes\u201d. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Courage about conviction"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This may sound wishful, or even delusional, particularly in light of Mr Trump\u2019s showing in Iowa. But the picture remains more complicated than that. Less than 15% of registered Republicans turned out, and of them almost half preferred a different candidate from Mr Trump, a quasi-incumbent. More broadly, Republican governors\u2014not just in New Hampshire but in states like Georgia, Ohio and even Iowa\u2014are succeeding not as Trump acolytes, but with more conventionally conservative and pragmatic Republican politics. Congressional Republicans, particularly in the House, are falling in line behind Mr Trump, but Mr Sununu insists that is only because they need him to raise campaign money. He thinks they will also revert to previous form when \u201cthey won\u2019t have this emperor, this, you know, this dictator, if you will\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Maybe. For all his criticism of Mr Trump, Mr Sununu, a fierce opponent of Mr Biden, has also said he would support Mr Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee, even if he is convicted of a felony. Mr Sununu insists he was engaging in a \u201chypothetical\u201d for \u201cshock value\u201d, to persuade Republicans they should not rely on the courts. \u201cIf you think Trump is a threat to democracy, then get up and participate in the democratic process and vote him out,\u201d he says. \u201cIt happens in the primary.\u201d But if it does not happen in the primary, conservatives such as Mr Sununu will have to ask themselves a hard question: whether they will really save their party by helping Mr Trump burn it down. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Lexington, our columnist on American politics: Ron DeSantis has some lessons for America\u2019s politicians (Jan 11th)How to win the culture war (Jan 4th)Why Donald Trump is gaining ground with young voters (Dec 20th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter examining the state of American democracy, and read other articles about the elections of 2024."}], "id": 27}
