Sometimes it is an enormous, hyperrealistic eyeball, a basketball or a whorl of flames.

The Irish band has a history of innovative concert design as well as corporate ventures, including a long partnership with Apple. Perhaps just as important, U2 is loved by middle-aged rock fans, who form the bulk of concertgoers in America and might shell out for a ticket.

The band plays on a stage shaped like a turntable while work by artists including Es Devlin and John Gerrard appears on the vaulting screen. During \u201cEven Better Than the Real Thing\u201d, there are animations of slot machines and Elvis kitsch. For \u201cWhere the Streets Have No Name\u201d, the crowd is transported into the blinding daylight of the high desert. During \u201cWith Or Without You\u201d the ceiling teems with images of endangered local species such as the leaf-nosed bat. \u201cIt\u2019s a show that\u2019s about the venue that it\u2019s in,\u201d says Willie Williams, U2\u2019s longtime production designer. \u201cIt\u2019s about us all going to experience the venue.\u201d "}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240113_CUP506.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "From one angle, the Sphere represents a major development in an existing trend of the arts becoming more immersive. Exhibitions that turn the paintings of Monet or Van Gogh into interactive, room-encompassing installations have proliferated in recent years, as have immersive theatre productions. Virtual-reality technology has improved significantly. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "From another angle, it is part of the evolution of the modern rock concert, which since the 1960s has combined light and sound to transport fans into another dimension. At a show your correspondent attended at the Sphere in October, there were moments when the experience was transcendent. (There is a quiet room, filled with bean bags, for the over-stimulated.) Yet viewers still took their eyes off the big screen to reach for the smaller ones in their pockets. At times the band seemed like an expensive soundtrack to the bright lights."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Is this the future of the concert? In the short term, no. The sheer cost of the Sphere\u2014$2.3bn\u2014means that the model cannot be easily reproduced. Its ostentation is also a barrier: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, recently vetoed a sister Sphere in the city, calling it \u201cbulky, unduly dominant and incongruous\u201d. Sphere Entertainment Company, the owner, hopes to build other iterations and is in \u201cserious\u201d talks for an arena in Abu Dhabi. But negotiations regarding Spheres in Saudi Arabia and South Korea have stalled."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some artists and promoters are said to be wary of developing shows that cannot be taken on tour to other, standard arenas and of letting the venue outshine the music.

The biggest acts have long had to make do with sports stadiums with dodgy acoustics, but this is a capacious, purpose-built venue. There seems to be plenty of demand for lavish productions by the biggest hitmakers: witness the billions of dollars in revenue made by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d and Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras\u201d tours.

Youngsters, who prefer to spend their money on experiences than on items, consider concerts good value, even when they are pricey. \u201cPeople still want to have that experience of liveness,\u201d says Steve Waksman, a concert historian, regardless of whether, as at the Sphere, it is \u201cmediated\u201d through screens.
