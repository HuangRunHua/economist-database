The two big national parties do not form grand coalitions. So when they lack majorities, both the PP and the centre-left Socialists devolve powers to Catalonia and the Basque Country in exchange for votes. But the current Socialist government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez, installed in November, is already testing the breaking point of such arrangements."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To secure the votes to return to power, Mr S\u00e1nchez promised a Catalan separatist party, Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia), an amnesty for the organisers of an illegal independence referendum held in 2017. This infuriated many Spaniards. But Junts promised to provide \u201cstability\u201d in the legislature. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet on January 10th, when the government needed parliamentary approval of three decrees, Junts held back. One decree included economic measures needed to unblock a \u20ac10bn ($10.9bn) tranche of European Union covid-recovery funds. In the end that decree and one other passed, but at a heavy cost. Junts and the Socialists agreed that the government would transfer control of immigration to Catalonia. Analysts scratched their head at what exactly control of immigration at a regional level would look like."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The parties had not worked that out either. The written deal referred to a \u201ccomplete\u201d transfer of authority on immigration. Mr S\u00e1nchez maintains this does not include border control or expelling migrants. Junts\u2019s secretary-general, Jordi Turull, insists that \u201c\u2019complete\u2019 must mean complete\u201d, and threatens to pull the party\u2019s backing for the government unless there is progress towards another independence referendum. Mr S\u00e1nchez defends his deals with Spain\u2019s various national separatists by arguing that they guarantee a \u201cprogressive\u201d government. But Junts is a conservative party close to Catalonia\u2019s business interests, and its leaders flirt with Catalan chauvinism.

His third decree, on social spending, failed on January 10th not because of Junts but because of a split in Sumar, the prime minister\u2019s smaller left-wing coalition partner, itself an amalgam. One element of Sumar, Podemos, quit the grouping after being given no ministries in the new government, and voted against the social-spending decree. Podemos argued it would cut unemployment benefits, though the claim is debatable. The real cause is probably lasting bitterness between Sumar and Podemos. Whatever the cause, Mr S\u00e1nchez cannot reliably count on Podemos as part of his wobbly majority."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Across Europe, parties of the centre-right and centre-left are failing to win the majorities they once enjoyed. But many countries solve this with broad coalitions. The refusal of Spain\u2019s left and right to cross the aisle renders this harder. Divisions between the centre and the periphery\u2014not just Catalan but Basque, Galician and so on\u2014are making it almost impossible."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr S\u00e1nchez\u2019s best hope for now might be distraction. An investigation by La Vanguardia, a Barcelona-based newspaper, claims that the previous PP government, in power from 2011 to 2018, had engaged in illegal tricks against Catalan nationalist leaders. Mr S\u00e1nchez says the matter will be looked into \u201cuntil the last consequence\u201d. Bashing the right (and fear of the far right) has held the left and the separatists together. Yet focusing on past Spanish repression also feeds Catalonia\u2019s drive for independence. The prime minister is an inveterate escape artist. But it is hard to imagine how he can survive almost four more years.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 39}
