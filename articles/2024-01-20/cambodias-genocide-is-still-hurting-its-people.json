That was the message Cambodia\u2019s leaders gave to the 20,000 people who gathered in Phnom Penh, the country\u2019s capital, on January 7th to commemorate \u201cvictory over genocide\u201d day. Around 2m people (nearly a quarter of the population) were killed between 1975 and 1979 during the Khmer Rouge\u2019s attempt at a great leap forward. Since that communist regime\u2019s fall, Cambodia\u2019s recovery has been impressive. Over the past decade annual growth has averaged 5.5%. Still, the effects of genocide linger."}, {"role": "body", "text": "More than 40 years on, the households and villages most ravaged by Khmer Rouge atrocities are among the country\u2019s poorest, according to a new working paper by Rahul Mehrotra of the Geneva Graduate Institute, a university. To quantify the long-term impact of the genocide, he measures the wealth of a household in relation to its proximity to a Khmer Rouge mass grave. In areas with more mass graves, households are likelier to be in the poorest quintile of Cambodia\u2019s wealth distribution. Few have access to piped water. This chimes with earlier studies. One published last year in the American Political Science Review, a journal, by Donald Grasse of the University of Southern California found that poverty rates in villages ruled by a radical faction of the Khmer Rouge were 4% higher than those controlled by a more moderate one. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These effects are so deeply entrenched because, in the Khmer Rouge\u2019s fanatical quest to establish an egalitarian society, educated Cambodians suffered especially. The loss of their lives and the forgone years of education among survivors set back subsequent generations. Decades later, men and women with median levels of exposure to the genocide, in terms of proximity to mass graves, receive 1.8 fewer years of education than they otherwise might. They are also likelier to work on farms than in factories or offices. These effects are most pronounced in families that lost members to the Khmer Rouge. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Households near former Khmer prisons are also especially likely to be poor, according to Mr Mehrotra\u2019s study. These enduring effects should serve as a warning to the current government. The ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party has banned the opposition, shut down independent news outlets and threatens activists. Cambodia\u2019s economy might otherwise be doing even better than it is. Remembering the past is important, but learning from it even more so. \u25a0"}], "id": 13}
