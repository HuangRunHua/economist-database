They wore their moral outrage like a badge of honour. True, they had conveniently put aside their earlier scruples about Mr Trump\u2019s suitability for the White House, bought off by generous corporate and personal tax cuts in 2017. True, many had cravenly turned a blind eye to his torching of environmental rules in support of a broad-brush regulatory bonfire. But his attempts to subvert American democracy, and the storming of the Capitol by his supporters on January 6th 2021, were a step too far. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "With unusual unity, they huffed and puffed back. Manufacturers called the riots a \u201cdisgusting episode\u201d. The Business Roundtable, a lobby group for big companies, called on Mr Trump to \u201cput an end to the chaos\u201d. Some prominent firms pledged not to provide financial support to the 147 Republican lawmakers who had refused to certify Mr Trump\u2019s defeat."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump\u2019s runaway victory in the first bout of the Republican primary contest in Iowa on January 15th cemented his status as the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. The polls suggest that in a head-to-head battle with President Joe Biden, he would win. But if there are murmurings of alarm about what a sequel to his chaotic presidency might mean for corporate America, this time they remain behind closed doors and off the record. Recently, Larry Summers, the pro-Biden former treasury secretary, urged CEOs to reject Mr Trump, noting that Italy\u2019s markets did well in Benito Mussolini\u2019s first few years in power\u2014until they didn\u2019t. Yet for the moment, most advisers and leaders of business associations counsel bosses to keep their heads down. Forget Il Duce. The message is: duck and cover. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is rationale for lying low. For a start, with ten months to go before the elections, anything can happen. Health issues could force either candidate out of the race (combined, Messrs Biden and Trump have had 158 years on Earth, nearly two-thirds the age of America itself). Mr Trump has not only his Republican rivals and Mr Biden to contend with, but 91 felony counts across two state courts and two federal districts, which could cause havoc. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Staking out the moral high ground from corner offices may also be counter-productive. It could backfire on those who attack Mr Trump in public, and bolster his anti-elite appeal. In office, he was quick to retaliate when attacked (preferred weapon, CAPITALISED TWEETS!). With trust in big companies on the wane in recent decades, it has become easier for populists to whip up an anti-business hue and cry. The head of a prominent business organisation ruefully admits that if he took a public stand against Mr Trump\u2019s campaign proposals, \u201cthe former president would be delighted.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the past few years, as the relationship between big business and Mr Trump\u2019s MAGA Republicans has soured, executives have learned the hard way the risks of sticking their necks out. A public-relations adviser to CEOs thought a year ago that it would be relatively easy for business to disown Mr Trump because of his legal travails. But then came the unofficial boycott of Bud Light, a beer, by right-wing culture warriors offended by its marketing campaign with a transgender influencer. The PR man realised the power of the mob to hurt the bottom line. \u201cWe are back to walking on eggshells,\u201d he says\u2014caught between progressive employees and customers demanding that firms take a stand against Mr Trump, and fear of the MAGA masses. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then there is Mr Biden. When pushed to express a preference, many businesspeople say they see him as a steadier pair of hands in policymaking and geopolitics.

As for the risk that Mr Trump could \u201cweaponise\u201d administrative agencies against his corporate enemies, Neil Bradley of the US Chamber of Commerce counters that Mr Biden, too, has urged his administration to crack down on \u201cjunk fees\u201d and price gouging in industries ranging from airlines to banking and health care. Mr Bradley draws few distinctions between either party\u2019s economic populism."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some business folk angrily dismiss efforts to draw parallels between the dangers of Mr Trump and Mr Biden. Calling it \u201cwhataboutism\u201d, they quietly profess to be terrified by the prospects of a second Trump administration. In the first one, the former president may have pushed radical policies, but sensible conservatives in his administration, as well as his own predilection for chaos, got the better of him. Now he is surrounded by true believers, such as those at the Heritage Foundation, a pro-MAGA think-tank whose job, says one business leader, is \u201cto prevent the amelioration of the Trump agenda\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In other words, Mr Trump has plenty of people in place to advance a plan that could shake up the economic framework on which American business has prospered for generations. The pillars of that plan of most immediate concern to corporate America are trade, migration, the fiscal deficit and public debt, and clean energy.

Businesspeople fear his goal is to terminate, unilaterally, trade with China, which would be a nightmare for any firm exposed to the country. Such a trade policy would be far more draconian than that of the Biden administration, which has kept Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs but worked with allies such as Japan and the Netherlands to restrict export of strategic goods such as advanced semiconductors without cutting China off altogether. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some hope that Mr Trump is posturing. They take solace in the fact that Congress, not the White House, regulates commerce and that courts adjudicate trade law. Yet Kent Lassman, who contributed a bold essay in support of free trade to the Heritage Foundation\u2019s pro-Trump \u201cProject 2025\u201d road map, thinks the former president means it, even if it disrupts America\u2019s existing trade treaties. Mr Trump \u201cis not changing his stripes\u201d; his sense that everything is a deal and that America is victimised is stronger than ever.

He made a similar mass-deportation promise on the campaign trail in 2016 but was frustrated by court challenges and other pushback. Still, any pickup in expulsions could hurt industries such as farming, leisure, retail and hospitality that rely on low-cost labour, executives say.

But a few corporate advisers raise the possibility that an unrestrained Mr Trump could trigger an American version of Britain\u2019s bond-market sell-off in 2022, when investors lost faith in the economic stewardship of Liz Truss, a prime minister who was outlasted by a lettuce. \u201cI have parliament envy,\u201d the leader of a lobby group chuckles\u2014unlike American leaders, he observes wryly, fiscally irresponsible British ones such as Ms Truss can be quickly forced out of office. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "America\u2019s environmental trajectory under Mr Trump is another concern. The former president, like the current one, would be expected to double down on industrial policy. But unlike Mr Biden, whose signature effort has been the green-tinged Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Mr Trump remains a climate sceptic who is likely to try to gut clean-energy programmes. In this case, he may face pushback from his own party. Many of the clean-energy projects predicated on funding from the IRA are in Republican-leaning states. Business, too, is likely to oppose a reversal of Mr Biden\u2019s green agenda.

Some executives shrug this off. A few weeks ago the head of an international asset manager met a group of American bankers and found them \u201cshockingly sanguine\u201d about the election. They told him that whatever the outcome, the system would hold; that stockmarkets had done well under both presidents; and that the American economy was in such rude health that it could survive even electoral shenanigans. \u201cMaybe their point is that business has transcended politics in America,\u201d he says.
