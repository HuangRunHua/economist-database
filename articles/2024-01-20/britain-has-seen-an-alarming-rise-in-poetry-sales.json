You can tell because on her website she calls herself \u201cDonna Ashworth\u2014Author and lover of words\u201d, doubtless to distinguish herself from all those other authors who don\u2019t like words. But Ms Ashworth loves so much more than words, for, as she says, \u201cwhat are we here to do, if not love?\u201d So she also loves our \u201cmagical\u201d planet, and being kind, and wrinkles, and the child within us all and putting meaningful things in italics. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It goes without saying that she loves motherly love. A mother\u2019s love for her son is \u201clike a beautiful black-hole\u201d, which is not a line to run past an astronomer. Or a Freudian. She loves hope (\u201cIt is the light\u201d), ageing and stretch marks (for they are \u201cby Mother Nature\u2019s paintbrush\u201d). The overall effect feels less like poetry than as though ChatGPT has been asked to produce inspirational fridge magnets. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But people love her back. Ms Ashworth\u2019s writing is, as one fan says, \u201clike a warm hug\u201d, which is not something anyone ever said of Philip Larkin, a misanthropic English poet. Then again, people do not buy Larkin in their droves. In early January \u201cWild Hope\u201d, the latest of Ms Ashworth\u2019s eight books of poetry, reached number seven on the Amazon bestsellers list. It is one of a handful of books behind a rise in British poetry sales: 2023 was the highest since records began. Which is to say, still very low (at \u00a314.4m, or $18.2m, according to Nielsen BookData). Britain may occasionally produce very good poets but Britons are not much interested in them, and they certainly don\u2019t pay to read them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Poets used to be marketable. Lord Byron\u2014often described as the first celebrity\u2014could sell 10,000 copies of a poem in a single day; in the 20th century a book by John Betjeman could shift 2.5m copies. Modernism may be partly to blame for the decline, says Jonathan Rose, a professor of history at Drew University, since it aimed to make literature deliberately difficult and \u201cfrown[ed] on anything that\u2026was relatively easy to appreciate\u201d. High-minded imprints still publish poetry by clever sorts sounding glum and using words like \u201cquixotic\u201d. Almost no one buys them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Ashworth does sell, and not just on paper. She is one of a number of poets for the Instagram age who market their work via social media (where she has 1.6m or so followers) and on websites. The poems may be of variable quality but the accompanying products are lovely. Ms Ashworth\u2019s website offers a \u201cWild Hope\u201d tote bag (\u00a38), scented candle (\u00a330) and hoodie (\u00a358); the site of an American poet, Rupi Kaur, offers not only books but a signed tapestry ($100); a T-shirt ($45) and a box of cards titled \u201cWriting Prompts Self-Love\u201d. Not a phrase you find in Virginia Woolf. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The problem with Instapoetry is not that it is full of nice words. Poetry has always allowed for prettiness: who knows, or frankly cares, what \u201cIn Xanadu did Kubla Khan\u201d means when it sounds so good? The problem is that it doesn\u2019t feel true. Larkin gives the reader a shiver of pleasure not because his lines are nice but because they are spot-on. Perhaps Instagram account-holders do indeed look at their stretch marks and see \u201cMother Nature\u2019s paintbrush\u201d. It seems much more likely that they just think, \u201cDamn\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet comparisons can also be unfair. As Ms Ashworth writes in a poem called \u201cYouier\u201d, imagine \u201cif snow didn\u2019t dare to fall / because rain was fallier / if planets did not glow / because stars were glowier.\u201d You should, she says, \u201cstop all that folly\u201d. And no one said a truier word than that. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
