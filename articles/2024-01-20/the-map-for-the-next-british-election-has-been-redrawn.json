In 2023 the boundaries of Britain\u2019s 650 constituencies were revised for the first time since 2010. Unlike redistricting in America, the exercise in Britain is determinedly non-partisan. Its effects are not. New data released on January 16th cast some light on how these new boundaries will affect MPs\u2019 prospects of re-election."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With a few exceptions the new boundaries follow a simple rule, laid down in 2020: to keep the number of electors in each constituency within 5% of 73,393, while staying faithful to geography. The process was run by independent boundary commissions in each of Britain\u2019s four devolved nations. Political parties took part. But Glenn Reed, from the Boundary Commission for England, says that the consultations gave as much weight to the views of Joe Public as to, say, Tory campaign headquarters. He says that the borders of one constituency in Devon were amended on the back of one individual\u2019s persuasive argument at a town-hall meeting. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The changes are substantial. Greater absolute population growth in the south of England means that this region will have 15 more MPs at Westminster after the next general election. Wales will have eight fewer; Scotland two fewer. The equalisation rule means that most constituencies\u2019 borders have been altered. Only 65 were spared the red pen. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Outside Northern Ireland, where the differences from 2010 are marginal, the population of electors in the remaining 554 seats is, on average, 20% different from those inside the old boundaries. Fully 265 old constituencies have been split into entirely new areas. The 59,000 former constituents of Ogmore in south Wales, for example, have been scattered among five newly created constituencies, from Cardiff to the Rhondaff."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To see how the new boundaries affect parties\u2019 prospects, psephologists have tried to work out how each of them would have fared if the boundaries had applied at the last general election, held in 2019.

The seats at the top of its target list have become a bit harder to win (see chart 2). Messrs Rallings and Thrasher calculate that whereas the party would have required a 12.0-percentage-point swing from the Conservatives under the old boundaries, it now needs a 12.7-point swing. That is equivalent to winning 4m more votes than in 2019. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These are not the only changes to the electoral map. A law passed in 2022 means that British citizens who left the country more than 15 years ago can now sign up to vote in the constituency where they were last registered. The government reckons that an extra 2.3m people are eligible to cast ballots as a result; based on how many eligible overseas voters actually registered ahead of the election in 2019, that would mean perhaps 500,000 more people on the rolls. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "None of this is likely to dismay Sir Keir too much. According to The Economist\u2019s tracker, the latest opinion polls imply a 14-percentage-point swing to his party since 2019; Labour\u2019s vote will be more efficiently spread than it was then. A large poll released by YouGov this week suggested that the Tories would lose 196 seats if an election were held now, their worst result since 1997. The new boundaries may have given Tory MPs a little edge.
