When Canadian pig farmers were told in the 1980s that their animals\u2019 gene pool was thin, they turned to wild boars from Britain for fortification, crossing them with an improved strain of domestic pig. This yielded a longer creature with an extra rib, and more meat per beast. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then, in 2001, the boar-meat market plunged. Some farmers, unable to sell their stock, simply released their hybrid pigs into the wild. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today those pigs\u2019 descendants roam the Canadian prairie provinces, a horde some 62,000 strong. They reproduce at a clip, and are well adapted to withstand the extreme winters, with thick fur and long legs that let them traipse through the snow. Their tusks are as sharp as steak knives. Their meaty breeding lends them a troublesome bulk now they are feral. One captured boar weighed more than 280kg (600lbs)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "They are destructive, opportunistic omnivores who feed by shoving their snout and tusks into the soil in search of grubs and roots.
