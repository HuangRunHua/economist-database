Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government spent most of 2023 attempting to dismantle his constitutional legacy. Yet when asked to appoint a judge to join the panel of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearing South Africa\u2019s claim that Israel is committing genocide in its war in Gaza, it chose Mr Barak, Israel\u2019s most renowned jurist."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Barak, who is 87, has earned acclaim and condemnation for spearheading what he called Israel\u2019s \u201cconstitutional revolution\u201d. In a series of landmark rulings he broadened the court\u2019s powers to accept petitions from public bodies and individuals, intervene in government decisions and cancel legislation. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "His supporters see him as the man who built the ramparts protecting Israel\u2019s fragile democracy from a rising tide of populist nationalism and religious fundamentalism.

Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition came to power promising to roll back Mr Barak\u2019s precedents, weaken the courts and gain control over the appointment of new judges."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On January 1st the supreme court, following in Mr Barak\u2019s footsteps, struck down a law passed five months earlier that had all but abolished the court\u2019s ability to use the \u201creasonableness standard\u201d to hold the government to account. Mr Netanyahu\u2019s decision a week later to appoint Mr Barak to the ICJ ruffled feathers in his Likud party: one parliamentarian accused the prime minister of \u201cshowing contempt for his voters\u201d.
