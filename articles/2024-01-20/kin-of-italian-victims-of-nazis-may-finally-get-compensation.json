He did not get far before he was shot dead. His killer was a rifleman of the Hermann G\u00f6ring 1st Paratroop Panzer Division. The date was March 18th, 1944. Pistoni\u2019s only crime was to live in Monchio: the rifleman belonged to a detachment sent to avenge nearby killings by local partisans of German soldiers, who had occupied Italy after it withdrew from the second world war the previous September."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The echoes of that lethal shot will reverberate again next month when the victim\u2019s granddaughter, Walda Pistoni, presents a petition for compensation to a judge in Rome. It is the latest in an avalanche of applications to a \u20ac61m ($66m) fund set up by the Italian government. \u201cThe issue has become enormous,\u201d says Giulio Arria, a lawyer representing several applicants, including Ms Pistoni. He estimates that up to 1,500 claims have been submitted. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Petitioners include descendants of victims of arbitrary killings, like Ms Pistoni; of executed partisans; of Jews and Roma who died in Nazi camps; and of Italian soldiers, sailors and airmen sent to Germany to work as forced labourers. In cases already judged, the descendants of those forced to labour have received payouts of \u20ac30,000-40,000. The kin of those who died have been awarded much higher sums. Two sisters orphaned when their father died in a massacre in Tuscany got \u20ac270,000 each. That has raised questions over the adequacy of the fund, which was created to avert a crisis in relations between EU partners. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Germany has long argued that its liability for the actions of its armed forces in Italy was settled in 1962 when it handed over 40m D-marks (worth around \u20ac1.5bn today). But the cash was not primarily intended to compensate individuals and, where it did, only applied to then-existing claims. Italian judges later ordered the German government to pay awards to numerous survivors and descendants of victims, but Germany refused. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Italy is not the only country with claims. A Greek parliamentary commission reckoned damage from its wartime occupation at \u20ac289bn, and the country\u2019s government has said it wants to negotiate reparations. Poland\u2019s previous government made even bigger demands\u2014it wanted \u20ac1.3trn. But in both cases, Germany says all debts were discharged in agreements struck decades ago."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2012 the International Court of Justice ruled in Germany\u2019s favour on the grounds that governments were not subject to decisions by the courts of other countries. But two years later Italy\u2019s constitutional court ruled that they were liable if the underlying offences violated international law. Italian judges continued issuing verdicts, and in 2022 a court in Rome was poised to order the confiscation of German government-owned properties, including the Goethe Institute, a cultural agency. Italy\u2019s previous government, headed by Mario Draghi, then stepped in and created the new fund. It was originally intended for outstanding claims, and set a 30-day deadline to file any new ones. But that deadline was pushed back in stages to the end of 2023, enabling hundreds more to be submitted."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile, Italian government lawyers have taken the place of the German government\u2019s representatives, fighting the applicants at every turn. Their objections have drawn fire from some politicians. \u201cThey\u2019ve put up arguments that make your skin crawl,\u201d says Dario Parrini, a senator for the opposition Democratic Party. Last May he submitted a bill to rein in the government\u2019s lawyers. It got cross-party support, but has languished in committee."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since the government appeals against every judgment, and appeals in Italy take years, some of the cash is unlikely ever to be disbursed. The two orphaned daughters, now in their eighties, may never see a euro. \u201cFrom a juridical standpoint, I am not surprised,\u201d says Mr Arria, the lawyer. \u201cBut as the grandson of a Jew who was deported to Auschwitz and never came back, I am horrified.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Correction (January 17th 2024): An earlier version said the compensation would come from the EU\u2019s Covid recovery fund.
