It is also central to the fortunes of India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Starting in the late 1980s, the BJP agitated for the replacement of a 450-year-old mosque in Ayodhya with a temple, because it occupied the spot where Ram had supposedly been born. In 1992 a mob worked into a frenzy by fire-breathing speeches by the bjp\u2019s leaders did indeed destroy the mosque, prompting riots across India in which some 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Since then, despite the bloodshed, the BJP has pledged at election after election to get the temple built. It is therefore hard to imagine a more triumphant moment for Narendra Modi, the prime minister, than the ceremony he will lead on January 22nd, when the long-awaited temple will at last be consecrated."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unofficially, the consecration will also serve as the launch of the BJP\u2019s campaign for the next national election, expected to be held over several weeks in April and May. Mr Modi has asked all Indians to celebrate the temple\u2019s inauguration by lighting lamps, much as Hindus do on Diwali, a holiday that commemorates Ram\u2019s triumphant return to Ayodhya after slaying the king of the demons. But only 80% of Indians are Hindu, and not all of them see the construction of the temple as a victory, let alone the 14% who are Muslim. Business tycoons and Bollywood stars will attend the consecration, to flatter Mr Modi, but most opposition politicians\u2014and some Hindu priests\u2014are staying away.

His blurring of religion, government and electioneering shows his disdain for India\u2019s secular constitution and its strict campaign rules. Worse, they fear, if these abuses help propel the BJP to its third election victory in a row, as expected, Mr Modi will go further, and attempt to turn India into an authoritarian Hindu state."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But as true and troubling as it is that Mr Modi and his party deliberately stoke communal tensions and undermine institutions, Indian democracy is hardly a lost cause. The bjp is not as all-conquering as it first appears. Its vote share in a general election has never reached 40%, a mark its main rival, the Congress party, passed seven times in its heyday (see chart). Moreover, the bjp benefits as much from Mr Modi\u2019s personal popularity and its superior electoral machine as from popular support for its ideology. And India\u2019s institutions have survived worse abuses."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Amrit large"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The bjp wants to create a national identity based on Hindutva, or Hindu-ness, that it says was suppressed for centuries by Muslim and British invaders. Hence the jamboree in Ayodhya, which is above all a rallying cry to the BJP\u2019s electoral base. The guest list is dominated by leaders of the party and affiliated Hindu nationalist groups, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a sort of pious cadet corps, and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), which launched the temple-building campaign. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The ceremony concludes \u201c500 years of continuous struggle for Hindus\u201d, says Champat Rai, the VHP\u2019s vice-president and general secretary of the trust building the temple. The event, he says, will send a clear message to Indian Muslims: \u201cThey should search for their roots: who were they four or five hundred years ago?\u201d They were Hindus, he continues, and should \u201csay that this land is our mother\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Hindutva is not the only thing the BJP cares about in Ayodhya. It is also boosting the local economy by pouring $9.6bn into development schemes, including a new airport and a new railway station. It has grand plans to turn the city into a tourist hotspot, with a Ram \u201cexperience centre\u201d, a fountain park, some 60 hotels and \u201cpatriotic\u201d wedding venues."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The city thus neatly captures the BJP\u2019s sales pitch: that it is building a prosperous, confident new India by restoring Hinduism to its rightful place as the bedrock of society. The violence of 1992 was a \u201csad moment\u201d, says Ayodhya\u2019s BJP mayor, Girish Pati Tripathi. \u201cBut Indian civilisation has passed it. We\u2019re moving forward. Why are Muslims worrying so much?\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This blend of economic development and Hindu revivalism is an appealing formula for many, especially in Hindi-speaking northern and central India. Pollsters believe it will win the BJP another majority in the Lok Sabha, the 543-seat lower house of Parliament, either on its own or as head of a coalition. That would make Mr Modi India\u2019s only prime minister to win three consecutive terms since the first, Jawaharlal Nehru of Congress. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Modi, who is 73, is another of the BJP\u2019s strengths. The image he has cultivated\u2014muscular, pious and avuncular\u2014appeals across India. His humble origins as the son of a tea-seller strike a chord with poorer Indians. His nationalist rhetoric resonates with the aspirational middle class. His reputation as an adept, industrious administrator appeals to the wealthy. Many also applaud his efforts to raise India\u2019s international status. Mr Modi\u2019s popularity accounted for up to a third of the BJP\u2019s votes in the most recent national election, surveys suggest."}, {"role": "second", "text": "No Meru accident"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Modi has not earned this reputation by chance, of course. The BJP carefully cultivates it, in part by strong-arming media to ensure positive coverage. In July a survey of Indian journalists showed that 82% thought their employers favoured the BJP. The party also enhances Mr Modi\u2019s image by attaching his name and face to popular government programmes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Above all, the BJP has a clear organisational edge. The party claims to be the world\u2019s biggest, with over 180m members, including 100m \u201cactive\u201d ones (China\u2019s Communist Party has 98m). Verifying that is hard: a call to a toll-free number is all that is needed to join. Still, academics who study the BJP say it can mobilise vast cohorts of party workers and volunteers, many of whom also belong to other Hindu nationalist groups. Managing them using a dedicated website and smartphone app, it appoints several to oversee each of India\u2019s million-odd polling stations, and even individual polling booths within them, with a party worker responsible for each page of the electoral roll. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Among them is Sachin Nahar, a 39-year-old Hindu farmer in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. Like his father and grandfather, he joined the RSS as a child, attending weekly sessions of exercise and political discussion. He then volunteered as a BJP booth worker in 2013 and now oversees 30 voters. He regularly visits them in person, adds them to WhatsApp groups and ensures that they turn out to vote."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For Mr Nahar Hindutva is central to the BJP\u2019s message. He reminds voters that Mr Modi has fulfilled many long-standing Hindu-nationalist demands, such as ending the special constitutional status of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and getting the temple in Ayodhya built. He and other BJP supporters in his constituency, which is 11% Muslim, are celebrating the temple\u2019s consecration with daily marches during which they chant, \u201cJai Shri Ram\u201d (\u201cVictory to Lord Ram\u201d). As for the future, he hopes\u2014and tells voters\u2014that the BJP will replace more mosques with temples and scrap special laws for Muslims regarding inheritance, divorce and other family matters. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the bjp arms him with more than talking points about communal disputes. It also provides a completely different means to target voters, by giving him a list of the beneficiaries in his district of various forms of government welfare. Under Mr Modi the government has rolled out new digital identification, payment and data-management platforms which allow most Indians to access public services and receive direct cash transfers from the state. Mr Nahar highlights this system in his outreach, crediting the prime minister."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The BJP is equally organised and efficient when it comes to social media. It claims only 20 people work in its National Digital Operation Centre, producing posts for its official accounts and trawling platforms for BJP-friendly content to promote. The heavy lifting is done by an army of volunteers (the party says it does not pay them), who help circulate official BJP content and create material of their own. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These digital campaigners often use WhatsApp, even after Meta, its parent company, tried to counter disinformation by restricting mass messages. \u201cWe invite like-minded people to the group, they invite their friends, they make separate groups and invite more people, and so it spreads,\u201d says Rathan Ramesh Poojary, a BJP media co-ordinator in Karnataka. He denies responsibility when volunteers advocate violence against Muslims: \u201cWe don\u2019t support killing.\u201d Still, he admits, \u201cThese guys support our ideology.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The popularity of the BJP\u2019s Muslim-bashing puts opposition parties in a bind. Most are reluctant to denounce Hindutva policies for fear of irking Hindu voters. In fact, some Congress leaders have embraced \u201csoft Hindutva\u201d\u2014visiting temples, building statues of Hindu deities and schmoozing with holy men. So far, that has annoyed secular and non-Hindu supporters without luring many votes from the BJP."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Hindutva presents problems for the BJP as well. Its appeal is much more limited in south India, where Islam arrived not by conquest but with proselytising merchants. Hindu reformist movements have more influence in that part of the country and fewer people speak Hindi, in which the bjp\u2019s leaders deliver their fiery speeches. The BJP no longer runs any of the region\u2019s states, having lost an election in May in Karnataka to Congress. And of the 130 seats representing South India in the Lok Sabha, the BJP holds only 29. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That helps explain why the bjp is not really the overwhelming force it appears. Its share of the national vote in Mr Modi\u2019s first election victory, in 2014, was only 31%. At the most recent national election, in 2019, it improved to 38%, still well short of a majority. If anything, Indian politics has become more competitive over the years, as Congress\u2019s star has faded and other parties, including the bjp, have grown bigger. The bjp is just remarkably good at translating its plurality of the vote into thumping parliamentary majorities, aided by India\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Were the opposition less divided and disorganised, the BJP would have much more of a fight on its hands. The most obvious problem is Congress\u2019s ossified structure, epitomised by the dynasticism at the top. The party\u2019s most prominent leader is the 53-year-old Rahul Gandhi, whose father, grandmother and great-grandfather all served as prime minister. He has recently become more confident, but has always seemed ambivalent about politics\u2014not surprisingly, given that both his father and his grandmother were assassinated."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Congress has hemmed and hawed about replacing him and, to the extent that it has done so, has plumped for an even less inspiring figure. In 2022 it chose a party veteran, Mallikarjun Kharge, as its first leader from outside the Gandhi family since 1998. He also heads the opposition\u2019s 28-party Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance. At 81, though, he lacks the charisma and vigour to challenge Mr Modi. And both Mr Gandhi and his mother, Sonia, remain very much on the scene."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A similar dynamic plays out in the lower echelons of the party. Whereas the bjp is ruthless about sidelining unpopular veterans and picking candidates based on their electoral prospects, Congress is dominated by ageing stalwarts who resist both new blood and new tactics. That, in turn, causes bright young things to defect to the BJP, where their prospects for advancement are much better."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Congress does appoint younger, more charismatic leaders and uses modern election techniques, it can do well. It won state elections in December in Telangana, for instance, helped by both a fresh face as local party leader and by the number-crunching of Sunil Kanugolu, an election-data specialist. But the party lost two other state elections held at the same time, in which local party chiefs of long standing declined Mr Kanugolu\u2019s help. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Congress is trying fitfully to reform. It has initiated a recruitment drive to expand its membership beyond the current 60m and launched an app for members, much like the BJP. It remains a contender, even in the Hindi-speaking heartland. Its average vote share in the three state elections there in December was 41%, not so far from the BJP\u2019s 46%. In fact, it had led two of the three outgoing state governments, so could hardly be described as a long-spent force."}, {"role": "body", "text": "None of this, of course, excuses the underhanded methods Mr Modi uses to retain power. He has a troubling record of eroding democratic institutions. His government has harassed and jailed journalists and activists. It has undermined the independence of the judiciary and the Election Commission. Its investigative agencies have targeted opposition leaders. In December an astonishing 146 opposition MPs were suspended from Parliament. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Opposition leaders are billing the coming election as a fight for the \u201csoul of India\u201d and a turning point in a global struggle between freedom and autocracy. They fear that Mr Modi wants to change the constitution to purge secular language and empower the executive. A revision of electoral boundaries, due in a couple of years, could facilitate that by expanding the Lok Sabha to around 750 seats, with most new ones going to the BJP\u2019s strongholds in the north."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Opposition parties are attempting to fight back, in part by promoting themselves better. The digital id and payments system for which the BJP takes credit was in fact initiated under Congress; Mr Modi oversaw only the final stages of its roll-out but receives endless adulation for it. Schooled by such experiences, opposition parties are trumpeting welfare schemes run by state governments they control. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Kailashings of failings"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The opposition also decries Mr Modi\u2019s failures, including the sudden withdrawal of most banknotes in 2016, the ditching of agricultural reforms after protests in 2021 and a botched response to the pandemic. Several of the BJP\u2019s promises, to double farmers\u2019 incomes, for example, and to boost manufacturing as a share of GDP, remain unmet. By some measures the economy has done worse under Mr Modi than under the previous Congress government. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another potentially potent line of attack is Mr Modi\u2019s close relationship with a handful of Indian tycoons, especially Gautam Adani, whose conglomerate was accused a year ago of fraud and insider trading by a short-selling firm based in New York (Mr Adani denied the allegations). Indian voters dislike cronyism and punished the previous Congress government after a series of corruption scandals."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240120_FBD002.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the opposition has not landed many punches. That is partly owing to Mr Modi\u2019s reputation for probity. Mainly, however, the opposition has not united around a single message or, critically, a single slate of candidates. Such a seat-sharing agreement could dramatically alter the electoral arithmetic, turning the BJP from the favourite to the underdog in many districts. But it would require strong, decisive party leaders, able to impose unpopular choices on the lower ranks. In Congress\u2019s case, neither Mr Kharge nor Mr Gandhi fits the bill."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some opposition politicians have concluded that, after 25 years of messy coalition governments from 1989 to 2014, India has reverted to the \u201cdominant party system\u201d of the prior four decades. Back then, Congress won big majorities and ruled with few constraints. It often passed laws and constitutional changes to empower the central government and so get its way. It sometimes resorted to abject authoritarianism. Most notably, Indira Gandhi, Rahul\u2019s grandmother, cancelled elections, jailed critics and suspended civil liberties during the Emergency of 1975-77. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The pessimists should remember, however, that India\u2019s democracy managed to correct itself. Mrs Gandhi lifted the Emergency under pressure from courts, students and political allies. She lost the subsequent election, badly. And although Congress soon returned to power, it could not reverse a long-term decline caused largely by its over-reliance on charismatic, centralised leadership. That may be scant comfort for opposition parties facing another drubbing\u2014but it should be food for thought for the BJP. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of our India coverage by signing up to Essential India, our free weekly newsletter."}], "id": 11}
