When Mr Trump left office in 2021, executives were relieved. Although many had enjoyed his generous business-tax cuts, they had also distanced themselves from his most outrageous pronouncements and tut-tutted about protectionism.

Mr Modi looks all but certain to lead the BJP to victory in elections due to be held by May, but his party\u2019s illiberalism, as exemplified by a new Hindu temple in Ayodhya in northern India, could spell trouble for India\u2019s economic progress. To fulfil his dream of making India a great power Mr Modi needs to show restraint, not abandon. Failure would dash the hopes of Indians, and the prospects for the brightest spot in the world economy."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240120_DE_AP.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1684.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Leader: Narendra Modi\u2019s illiberalism may imperil India\u2019s economic progressBriefing: Narendra Modi\u2019s electoral juggernaut looks unstoppableBanyan: How Hindu is India\u2019s foreign policy?"}], "id": 3}
