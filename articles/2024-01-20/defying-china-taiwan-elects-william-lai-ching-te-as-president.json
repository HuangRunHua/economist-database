Mr Lai was a separatist whose election would create a \u201cdangerous situation of high winds and urgent waves in the Taiwan Strait\u201d, a spokesman for China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office threatened. On January 13th Taiwan\u2019s voters elected Mr Lai anyway, ushering in an unprecedented third term for the pro-independence ruling party."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So far the Taiwan Strait has remained relatively calm. But Mr Lai may soon face storms at home. His party has lost its majority in the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan\u2019s parliament. It will struggle to forge consensus on divisive issues like defence spending and strategy. China already seems to have identified such domestic divisions as Taiwan\u2019s weak point. Its first statement responding to the election claimed that the DPP\u2019s victory \u201cdoes not represent mainstream public opinion\u201d and promised that it would keep working with \u201crelevant parties, groups and people\u201d within Taiwan to promote \u201cnational unification\u201d."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240120_ASC922.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 928.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most Taiwanese support neither immediate unification nor independence but the current state of de facto independence. Yet voters are divided over how best to safeguard it. Mr Lai won with 40% of the vote, a sign that a plurality want to continue along his party\u2019s path of strengthening deterrence and relations with other democracies. Another third of the vote went to Hou Yu-ih of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT), who promised to lower tensions through trade and dialogue with China, based on rejecting Taiwan\u2019s independence. A hefty 26% went to a third-party challenger, Ko Wen-je, of the parvenu Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cTaiwan is telling the whole world that between democracy and authoritarianism we choose to stand on the side of democracy,\u201d Mr Lai told his victory rally on election night. But vows to defend democracy are no longer enough for many voters. Mr Ko\u2019s supporters in particular were drawn to his focus on domestic issues like housing and wages. Many were young Taiwanese who said they disliked the two traditional parties\u2019 \u201cideological\u201d politics."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The DPP is already worrying about how to unite the country. From February the parliament will be split between the three parties, with TPP legislators a potentially decisive vote. The last time Taiwan had a split assembly and executive was under the DPP\u2019s Chen Shui-bian, president from 2000 to 2008. The KMT-dominated parliament blocked Mr Chen\u2019s proposed military budgets more than 60 times, eventually forcing him to cut defence spending from a proposed $19.6bn to $320m. During his campaign Mr Lai warned that opposition lawmakers might block his budgets."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That will alarm America, Taiwan\u2019s main military partner. An unofficial delegation of former senior US officials visited Taiwan just after the elections. They met not only Mr Lai and the outgoing president, Tsai Ing-wen, but also Mr Hou, Mr Ko, and the KMT\u2019s party chair, Eric Chu. Afterwards Laura Rosenberger of the American Institute in Taiwan said that America would continue to \u201cwork across the political spectrum\u201d in the belief that all Taiwan\u2019s parties want to do \u201cwhat\u2019s best for Taiwan, regardless of their political affiliations\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s Communist Party seems to disagree. On January 15th its journal Qiushi published a speech by President Xi Jinping about the importance of winning hearts and minds among ethnic Chinese worldwide, including \u201cpatriotic unification forces\u201d in Taiwan. On January 16th China\u2019s Ministry of State Security published an article on China\u2019s Anti-Secession Law, calling it a \u201csharp sword hanging high\u201d over the heads of would-be separatists, and warning Taiwanese spies that the DPP might put their lives at risk. The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid, said China would try to rally Taiwan\u2019s people, distinguishing \u201ccompatriots\u201d from \u201csecessionists\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the past, Mr Lai was known for being more outspoken in his advocacy of independence than Ms Tsai. But during the campaign he promised not to declare independence. Taiwan is already independent in effect, so has no need to declare it, the DPP\u2019s leaders say. Mr Lai\u2019s running-mate, Hsiao Bi-khim, the island-state\u2019s former representative to America, is known in Washington as a firm but careful defender of Taiwanese democracy. Together they are rather unlikely to stray from Ms Tsai\u2019s path of moderation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is little reassurance to the Chinese Communist Party, which also hated Ms Tsai. Since she came to power eight years ago, China has cut off communication with Taiwan\u2019s authorities and increased military pressure on the island. In August 2022, China sent missiles over Taiwan and enacted a mock blockade around it after a visit from Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives. China also sent balloons over the island and reimposed some tariffs on Taiwanese products in the weeks before the vote. But it did not make a major new show of force."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That may change in the coming months as China tries to isolate Taiwan internationally and divide it internally. On January 15th the Republic of Nauru, one of Taiwan\u2019s few remaining diplomatic partners, said it was cutting ties with Taiwan to recognise the People\u2019s Republic of China instead. China\u2019s foreign ministry gloated."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240120_ASC107.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Given the fuss China made over Mr Lai, some kind of symbolic military action seems likely. That would excite China\u2019s online nationalists: an Economist analysis of posts on Weibo, a microblogging platform, found that hostile posts about Taiwan more than doubled after the election (see chart). Mentions of \u201cmotherland\u201d rose five-fold; \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d jumped eight-fold. A potential flashpoint is May 20th, Mr Lai\u2019s inauguration day."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Lai did not quite manage to avoid controversy during the campaign. He caused a rumpus by saying he hoped, against precedent, to see a Taiwan president visit the White House one day. Such language makes American officials nervous. For its part, China will want to make Taiwanese citizens feel they have entered more dangerous waters by electing Mr Lai. The government in Beijing failed to scare Taiwan\u2019s voters into ditching the DPP. It will now try to make them regret it. \u25a0"}], "id": 12}
