In September he lost his cool with an online commenter who questioned the price of an eyebrow pencil he was showcasing. \u201cHow is it expensive? It has been this price for years,\u201d Mr Li asked incredulously. \u201cMaybe you should look at yourself. Has your pay risen? Have you been working hard in these years?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Li, who later apologised, had touched a nerve.

It has yet to recover (see chart). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The gloom is making customers picky and cost-conscious. In October China slipped into deflation, with consumer prices falling by 0.2% compared with a year earlier. People are not squandering money by redefining their eyebrows.

Pinduoduo offered merchants on its platform extensive subsidies to help them provide discounts to consumers. JD.com, the closest rival to Alibaba, promised to compensate customers if they found a cheaper price for a product within 30 days of buying it. Consumers are also becoming ruthlessly strategic. Some shoppers add a luxury item to their purchases so they can meet the minimum spending threshold for a discount on their bill. They then return the luxury item and keep the rest."}, {"role": "body", "text": "These marketing gambits have, it appears, boosted the volume of sales more than the value.

According to official figures released on November 15th, retail sales (both online and off) rose by 7.6% in October compared with a year earlier. That was faster than expected.
