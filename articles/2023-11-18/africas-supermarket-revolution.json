Newer analysis has incorporated data on ownership of bourgeois assets such as fridges. Last year Fraym, an analytics firm, estimated that there were 330m people in what it called Africa\u2019s \u201cconsumer class\u201d, roughly a quarter of the continent\u2019s population of 1.3bn.

In 2021 Shoprite, a South African retailer, sold its outlets in Nigeria, a tacit admission that it had failed to crack the market. Its struggles had several causes, including a decision to sign leases priced in dollars, so the chain was stung when the naira depreciated. It also found it tricky to repatriate funds. Yet at root, argues Mr Enunwa, was a belief that what worked in South Africa would work in Nigeria. Its shops imported many South African items. \u201cThese were products that Nigerians did not know or care about.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Marketsquare began in Yenagoa, the capital of Bayelsa State, the smallest of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states, rather than Abuja, the federal capital, or Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s sprawling commercial capital. \u201cThe Lagos consumer has become a diva,\u201d explains Mr Enunwa. \u201cThey are spoiled for choice.\u201d His decision to start in a secondary city speaks to an underappreciated trend. The urbanisation of Africa\u2014the continent where cities are growing at the fastest rate\u2014is often depicted as a story of megacities like Lagos. But more Africans (200m) live in towns with populations of between 30,000 and 300,000 than in cities of more than 3m (140m). And small-town Africa is underserved by formal retail.

They have proved elusive; Jumia\u2019s share price has fallen by 90% in almost five years. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of articles about Jumia that say there is not enough demand in Africa,\u201d says Francis Dufay, who became the CEO earlier this year. \u201cThe reality is much more complicated.
