But the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on November 15th that the government\u2019s plan to fly asylum-seekers to Rwanda was unlawful is still a hefty blow to Rishi Sunak. The prime minister has pledged to tackle the problem of illegal migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats. The court\u2019s decision puts a big hole in the Illegal Migration Act, which allows for asylum-seekers who have entered Britain via another safe country to be detained and deported."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The prime minister is not giving up. Shortly after Britain\u2019s highest court ruled unanimously against the scheme on the ground that Rwanda was an unsafe destination for asylum-seekers, Mr Sunak said he would pass an \u201cemergency\u201d law asserting that it was in fact safe. He also said that he would not allow a \u201cforeign court\u201d to block the scheme. Tough talk may cheer hardliners, but it is hard to see how any planes will take off for Kigali soon. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The scheme always had an obvious logistical flaw. The British government claimed it was \u201cuncapped\u201d, but its counterpart in Rwanda said it could take only a few hundred people a year. Since security was stepped up on ferry and tunnel Channel crossings, the number of small-boat migrants has surged. In 2022 it reached a record 46,000, up from 299 in 2018."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The bigger problem was legal. Many of those who enter Britain in this way are granted asylum: Afghans and Syrians have grant rates above 95%. In June the Court of Appeals said the risk of refoulement\u2014sending asylum-seekers back to unsafe countries\u2014meant the Rwanda plan breached the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The European Court of Human Rights, which upholds that convention, had been the first court to block the government\u2019s scheme in 2022. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In its verdict this week the Supreme Court cited several cases, documented by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, of asylum-seekers from decidedly unsafe countries, including Afghanistan and Syria, being sent home from Kigali. The rule against refoulement, it said, was contained in several laws ratified by Britain, not just the ECHR."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is a problem not just for Mr Sunak but also for his opponents on the right of the Tory party. In a furious letter to Mr Sunak shortly after she was sacked as home secretary on November 13th, Suella Braverman said the prime minister had betrayed his promise to \u201cstop the boats\u201d by rejecting calls to leave the ECHR. Claims that the convention prevents decisions that are Britain\u2019s to make are less persuasive when the Rwanda plan breaches other laws, too. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "What now? Britain has already paid \u00a3140m ($175m) to the government in Kigali, though observers note the money has not been spent on improving its asylum processes. As well as legislation, Mr Sunak also said he would publish a new treaty with Rwanda giving \u201cassurances\u201d that when \u201cwe send someone to Rwanda they won\u2019t be incorrectly returned to their own country\u201d. Mr Sunak is pushing for reforms to \u201crule 39 orders\u201d, too\u2014interim injunctions issued by the echr. Yet it is unclear whether any treaty would satisfy the courts, whether any law would get through the Lords or how exactly the echr could be stopped from blocking things. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Beyond such theatrics, the government will look for other safe third countries for asylum-seekers to be sent to. None of the court judgments that ruled against the Rwanda scheme found that the idea itself was illegal; only that Rwanda was an unsuitable destination. There was \u201cclearly\u201d an appetite for the concept in other European countries, said James Cleverly, the new home secretary. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Sunak can point to some progress elsewhere. So far this year the number of small-boat migrants is markedly down on last year\u2019s. That is largely because of a deal the government struck with Albania to return Albanian citizens who come illegally. Sunder Katwala of British Future, a think-tank, says it should seek to make similar deals with those countries whose citizens have asylum grant rates of, say, below 60%. Stopping the boats will not depend on one big policy, but a number of small ones. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
