On November 13th the exceptions\u2014the justices of the Supreme Court\u2014announced that they had decided to join their lower-court peers.

Calls for the court to clean up its act have followed investigative reports from ProPublica and other publications uncovering several justices\u2019 ethical lapses. Justice Clarence Thomas, the main target of those articles, failed to declare decades of luxury travel on the tab of Harlan Crow, a generous donor to conservative causes. Mr Crow also bought a home Justice Thomas owned in Georgia and footed the tuition bill for his grandnephew\u2019s private school.

This too was not declared. And although his wife Virginia lobbied President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff to help overturn the 2020 election outcome, Justice Thomas opted not to recuse himself from cases challenging the election results and involving Mr Trump\u2019s role in the riot at the Capitol on January 6th 2021."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Without alluding to any of this\u2014or to Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s fishing trip to Alaska, paid for by a right-wing billionaire who later brought business before the court, or to any other colleagues\u2019 apparent conflicts\u2014the justices all signed on to a code of conduct. (Justices Alito and Thomas contend they did nothing wrong.) The document, the court wrote, is \u201csubstantially derived\u201d from the code that applies to other federal judges. Justices should \u201cuphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary\u201d and \u201cavoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety\u201d. They are to \u201cperform the duties of office fairly, impartially and diligently\u201d and may undertake only appropriate \u201cextrajudicial activities\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In five pages of commentary accompanying the code, the court acknowledged that some canons are \u201cbroadly worded general principles informing conduct\u201d\u2014not \u201cspecific rules\u201d\u2014and require justices to exercise \u201cjudgment\u201d and \u201cdiscretion\u201d. The document also notes that, since the Supreme Court is a \u201cunique institutional setting\u201d, the existing code cannot be adopted without tweaks. For example, justices must recuse themselves from cases in which they have a financial interest or \u201cpersonal bias or prejudice\u201d. But unlike judges who can be easily replaced, justices have no such substitutes and have a \u201cduty to sit\u201d whenever possible. \u201cMuch can be lost\u201d, the code says, \u201cwhen even one justice does not participate in a particular case.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another revision may have been made to avoid impugning justices who have enjoyed the largesse of wealthy donors. Whereas the code for other federal judges bars them from \u201cconvey[ing] the impression\u201d that someone is \u201cin a special position to influence the judge\u201d, the Supreme Court\u2019s rules qualify this phrase with \u201cknowingly\u201d. As long as a justice is unaware that his actions are raising eyebrows\u2014by creating the impression, say, that he is under the influence of an ideological benefactor\u2014he or she remains in compliance with the new code.

And the code closes on an encouraging note that may pave the way for further self-improvement if the justices wish to examine and emulate the \u201cbest practices\u2026of other federal and state courts\u201d. Until then, though, America\u2019s highest judges will have to keep a closer eye on themselves. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 22}
