Some 70,000 climate advocates, diplomats and other hangers-on will attend an event that begins on November 30th in Dubai, one of the gleaming cities built on wealth that fossil fuels have brought to the region. The fact that the world\u2019s most important climate gathering will be hosted by a leading oil producer has sparked outrage among environmentalists. That the summit\u2019s president, Sultan Al Jaber, runs adnoc, the uae\u2019s national oil company (noc), is proof, whisper conspiracists, that the fix is in on behalf of Big Oil. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet from Abu Dhabi on the Persian Gulf, the shipping route to global markets for the world\u2019s greatest concentration of oil reserves, to Fujairah on the Gulf of Oman, an entrepot abuzz with tankers carrying Russian oil evading Western sanctions, comes a sense of vulnerability to climate change. The region is short on water and home-grown food. The rising heat of summer is becoming inhumane. The cities built on these desert sands are at risk from a rising sea level. That the uae shares the threat from increasing global temperatures makes the gathering no less fraught.

That would be alarming. A un report analysing the national climate-action plans of the 198 parties to the cop found them woefully inadequate for tackling emissions (see chart 1) and hence achieving the goal of limiting the global temperature rise called for in the Paris agreement of cop21 in 2015. In short, the stakes are high. Amid the summit\u2019s myriad technical and procedural goals, three big topics cry out for action."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first is the task of cracking down on emissions of methane, an overlooked greenhouse gas (ghg).

And often the payback is quick since methane neither vented nor flared during gas extraction can be sold, says Bjorn Sverdup of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (ogci), a consortium of a dozen leading oil and gas firms. Its members have reduced their methane emissions roughly by half since 2017, from a leakage rate of 0.3% of total marketed gas to 0.15% in 2022, using technologies that monitor leaks and improve operations. They have pledged to keep that level below 0.2%."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rumours suggest that many nocs are resistant but Mr Sverdup reports that \u201cmomentum is building for action at cop\u201d even among those companies. As part of a deal struck this week with America, China (the world\u2019s largest methane emitter) says it will, for the first time, include the gas in its national climate plan. The eu has also just agreed strict curbs on methane emissions from fossil fuels, including imports. A credible side deal involving many big oil companies \u201cwould mean more than an ambitiously worded diplomatic communiqu\u00e9\u201d from official proceedings, reckons Mr Krupp. Mr Al Jaber has been pressing big oil and gas firms hard in private to commit to slash methane emissions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The prospects for improved climate finance are gloomier. Emerging economies will complain about the failure of the rich world to keep its promises. The $100bn that was due to have been provided by 2020 by rich countries has yet to turn up in full.

After an acrimonious process, negotiators recently agreed to give the World Bank a temporary role in hosting this new facility but failed to agree to fund it.
