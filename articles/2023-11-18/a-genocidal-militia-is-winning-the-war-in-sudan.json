UN officials estimate that at least 800 people were killed; local monitors put the toll as high as 1,300.

By one count there were 168 airlifts from the UAE between May and September. (The UAE has denied sending arms to \u201cany of the warring parties\u201d.)

The UN Security Council is paralysed and the organisation\u2019s leadership has shown far less interest in Sudan than it has in Gaza. A joint African Union (AU)-UN peacekeeping mission to Darfur withdrew in 2021 in the belief that blue helmets were no longer necessary. The AU and the continent\u2019s leaders have been all but silent in the face of the sort of atrocities it once pledged to stop.
