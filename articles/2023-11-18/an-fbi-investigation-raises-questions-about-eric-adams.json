That morning the mayor had landed in Washington, DC, to meet lawmakers and White House officials to discuss his city\u2019s migrant crisis. For more than a year Mr Adams has called on the federal government to help the city cope with 130,000 refugees. Mr Adams abruptly cancelled his meetings and returned to New York. Then on November 10th the New York Times revealed that the FBI had seized Mr Adams\u2019s mobile devices. The FBI is also said to be looking into whether Mr Adams pressed the fire department to fast-track the opening of the new Turkish consulate, despite some unresolved safety issues. Mr Adams pooh-poohed any impropriety.

The Adams administration is not the first to be the subject of investigations. Back in 1932 Jimmy Walker, who also prided himself on promoting city nightlife, resigned amid corruption allegations. More recently, prosecutors looked at whether Bill de Blasio\u2019s campaign tried to dodge contribution limits."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the same press briefing Mr Adams warned that upcoming budget cuts would be steep because housing migrants is expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely painful for New Yorkers, and that is why we continue to say we need help.\u201d But it may be harder to stay focused and grind while the feds are sniffing around. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 26}
