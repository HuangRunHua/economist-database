It was also representative of a typical month of school gun violence."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There were 23 incidents of gun crime on or near school property over 13 days, which ranged from a fourth-grader brandishing a gun in the toilets to a student\u2019s stepfather committing suicide in the school office."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In five shootings, across four days, a victim died."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In eight more someone was injured."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There were also 148 \u201cSWAT hoaxes\u201d, in which false threats of a school shooting were made to police, which can lead to an armed response."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What follows contains images and descriptions of violence some readers may find distressing."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Williamsburg Charter High School, Brooklyn, New York"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "2.15pm: A 15-year-old and 17-year-old are caught in a fight during dismissal and shot in the legs. A staff member is also injured. The shooter was not a student."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This shooting took place outside the school building, after school, which means it would not be counted as a school shooting in most datasets. Although the government logs every time someone is killed or injured in a car crash in America, there is no federal record of when a gun is fired on school property, and the databases that do exist all define this type of violence differently. Some only include shootings that happen during the school day, while others only count incidents in which someone is killed or injured."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The K-12 School Shooting Database, compiled by David Riedman, a data scientist, includes every time a gun is brandished, fired on or hits school property\u2014or areas outside the school, such as pavements\u2014at any time and for any reason, as these incidents can all cause significant disruption. \u201cMost people think that a school shooting is something where it\u2019s this deranged person who\u2019s coming into the school,\u201d he says. \u201cBut really, the most common circumstance for a gun to be fired is a dispute between students, usually taking place in a hallway or parking lot at dismissal.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The impacts can play out for years. Researchers from Stanford University studied gun violence in Texan schools between 1998 and 2006. They found absences and grade repetition increased after a shooting, while graduation rates decreased. Students whose schools had experienced a shooting earned less by their mid-20s than those from unaffected schools. Another Stanford study found that, nationwide, near schools that experienced a fatal shooting, youth antidepressant prescriptions increased by 21% for two to three years after."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Brooklyn, the school moved to remote learning for three weeks after the shooting. \u201cThere was the lingering question of will this happen again? Am I safe?\u201d says Jahi Bashir, the head of school at the time of the shooting. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to focus on instruction when you have these thoughts.\u201d Despite extensive mental-health support from the school, 49 students left in the months following\u2014more than three times the drop-out rate of a year earlier. The 15-year-old who was shot did not come back to in-person lessons for the remainder of the school year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The school spent over $90,000 on metal detectors and new security cameras. Three other schools that experienced shootings in February also invested in added security, at a total cost of around $450,000, including bullet-resistant glass and entry systems. The school-security, or \u201chardening\u201d, industry in America grew by 57% between 2016 and 2021, when adjusted for inflation, to $1.6bn. But as this spending has increased, so too have shootings. \u201cWe\u2019re going in the wrong direction,\u201d says Mr Riedman."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Part of the reason is that, by Mr Riedman\u2019s calculations, more than 70% of shootings take place outside school buildings, which metal detectors and bullet-proof doors will do little to prevent. Ellen Eagen, legal counsel for Williamsburg Charter High School, says the school\u2019s Board of Trustees nevertheless had little choice: \u201cWe are desperate to make schools safer, and in the absence of sensible gun regulation, educators have to do whatever they can to improve safety.\u201d But it is not just spending on hardening that appears misplaced. The ways in which schools prepare students for an active shooter can have harmful consequences too."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Aspen Elementary School, Aspen, Colorado"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "8.30am: The school holds a lockdown drill to prepare students for an active shooter"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lockdown drills are part of life in around 95% of public schools in America. They became widespread after the Columbine mass shooting in Colorado in 1999, as no one who had hidden in a locked room was killed. But there is now a debate about whether these drills are needlessly traumatic given how unlikely children are to be involved in a Columbine-style siege."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is little guidance about how schools should run drills, or how many are necessary. Massachusetts does not mandate a number of lockdown drills per year, while neighbouring New York requires four. It is down to school districts or even individual schools to determine what these should involve. This has led to reports of schools using role play and fake blood, and children messaging their parents during a drill to say goodbye because they thought they were going to die."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some of the most comprehensive research into how best to run drills has been done by Jaclyn Schildkraut, who has been studying drills in Syracuse, New York, for five years. There, drills are unscheduled. It is made clear they are not real, and students are given a chance to debrief afterwards. \u201cWe don't set schools on fire to practise fire drills,\u201d says Ms Schildkraut. \u201cSo it\u2019s really important that we're not simulating active-shooter events to practise a lockdown.\u201d But even in a school in Syracuse, some children seemed unsettled by the drills when The Economist visited."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are now multiple bills going through state legislatures to reduce drills\u2019 frequency and make them less upsetting, by doing things like announcing a drill before students lock down, and allowing parents the chance to opt their children out."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ultimately, however, no amount of practice can prepare students, teachers and parents for the terror of a potential shooting."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Colorado"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "8.25am-1.45pm: Police across the state receive calls from a man saying he is about to attack local schools"}, {"role": "body", "text": "These calls prompted a huge police response. One of the first dispatch centres to receive a call was in Aspen. Just over a minute later officers were in Aspen Elementary School hunting for a gunman. At least 44 officers from five different forces, along with 27 medics, 26 firefighters and nine ambulances, attended the scene. Michael Buglione, the local sheriff, said it was the biggest unplanned emergency response he had seen in his 18-year career. Around 500 children locked down in their classrooms, just as they had practised the day before."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But there was no shooter. This was a hoax call, one of 17 made across Colorado on February 22nd."}, {"role": "body", "text": "These \u201cSWAT hoaxes\u201d, so called as they can require the response of a special weapons and tactics, or SWAT, team, capitalise on fear to cause chaos\u2014and they are increasing. According to The Educator\u2019s School Safety Network, a think-tank, there were around 70 such hoaxes against schools in the 2018 school year, and 450 in 2022. Mr Riedman, who started tracking swatting in 2023, recorded 148 in February alone."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some of the calls were made from a number with a Florida area code\u2014but they may not have come from there. They were made using a voice over internet protocol service, which, if coupled with the use of a virtual private network (VPN), means they could have come from anywhere. Although the attack was a hoax, the fear felt by people who lived through it was very real."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Jennifer Doebler, a former FBI intelligence analyst, believes these calls are more than just pranks. \u201cIt was an intentional plot to create mass chaos,\u201d she says. \u201cI personally believe these are acts of domestic terrorism.\u201d The caller behind the Colorado hoaxes said his name was Nelson, and referred to pipe bombs and an AR-15 rifle on several calls. Keven Hendricks, a cybercrime expert and investigator, says these details suggest these could be copycat attacks, as they are reminiscent of Kya Nelson, a serial swatter who is now in prison. The FBI started tracking SWAT hoaxes in May 2023, and is investigating the Colorado calls, but declined to comment on these cases when contacted by The Economist. (Watch a longer investigation into swatting.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is also a financial cost. The Aspen school district spent $6m improving its security following the call in February\u2014$2m over budget\u2014because the police response highlighted shortcomings."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the real thing can damage communities in ways that cannot so easily be repaired."}, {"role": "second", "text": "East High School, Denver, Colorado"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "2.30pm: A 16-year-old student named Luis Garcia is shot in his car near the school. He dies 16 days later. Students march on the state capitol two days after his death, demanding change."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The twins\u2019 activism has had some impact: in the months after the shooting state legislators raised the legal age to purchase firearms in Colorado from 18 to 21. The state\u2019s red-flag laws, which allow people to petition for authorities to confiscate an individual\u2019s firearms, were expanded, and a three-day waiting period before firearms purchases can be delivered was introduced. But the shootings continued. On March 22nd a student at East High, Austin Lyle, shot and injured two staff members as they were checking him for weapons at the school\u2019s entrance. He killed himself later that day."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This prompted a dramatic shift within Denver\u2019s public-school system. The school board reintroduced school resource officers (SROs), in effect armed police, to several schools. SROs had been removed in 2020 in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder over fears they were disproportionately targeting non-white students. In June the school board voted to make SROs permanent, and as of August 2023 there were at least 14 armed officers in Denver schools paid for by the city. But for many parents this was not the answer they were hoping for, and the community remains deeply divided about the best way to protect its children."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Denver Public School board issued a new safety plan in June in response to the shootings stating that individual schools could invest in metal detectors, but Mr Katsaros\u2019s remain in a storage unit. He has long campaigned for better safety, but like many parents in Denver, he now feels the problem goes much deeper than security checks. \u201cI thought it was all about guns,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve come to find out, it\u2019s the entire discipline structure. Having metal detectors as a deterrent is one solution [...] Having school resource officers is a solution, but there\u2019s no singular solution that can fix this.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many parents, teachers and pupils would agree. But a lack of timely and comprehensive data on school shootings is also hindering America's response. Mr Riedman notes that it can take over a year for crime data to be published. \u201cWith trends like swatting or shootings at schools, these are things where we need to be adjusting policy in real time,\u201d he says. A clearer understanding of the extent of gun crime in American schools, and the dire consequences, may galvanise authorities and politicians to provide better answers."}], "id": 25}
