Mr Ghosh\u2019s account begins with Catherine of Braganza marrying King Charles II in 1662. Her dowry included a casket of Chinese tea and some small islands off India\u2019s west coast. The fashion for tea simmered quickly in Britain, with the East India Company (EIC) controlling its import. The EIC funnelled goods to China from India. An appetite for one of these, cotton, was already strong. But the EIC began coercing Indian farmers to grow a different crop that, used recreationally, would turn countless people into addicts. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Europeans did not invent the opium trade. Rather, they expanded modest local practices into a rapacious global enterprise. Mr Ghosh argues that the Dutch created the first \u201cimperial narco-state\u201d in the 17th century. The model was \u201cperfected by the British\u201d, who promoted the convenient myth that \u201cnon-white people were by nature prone to addiction and depravity\u201d. When China banned the import of opium in 1729, the British turned to smugglers who called themselves \u201cprivate traders\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most of the characters he depicts are venal. One exception is Lin Zexu, a Chinese civil servant. In 1839 he complained in an undelivered letter to Queen Victoria that opium traders were \u201cperfectly careless about the injuries they inflict\u201d in their \u201cinordinate thirst after gain\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Americans felt that thirst, too. \u201cSend ships immediately to China,\u201d John Adams urged Congress in 1783, as \u201cthis trade is as open to us as to any nation.\u201d Soon families in New England grew rich from it, pouring some of their gains into philanthropy\u2014which enriched many institutions, including Ivy League universities. The largesse resembles that of the Sackler family, whose company, Purdue Pharma, has done much to fuel the present century\u2019s epidemic of opioids (a class of painkillers that can be derived from or simulate opium). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The trade\u2019s legacy endures in other ways. \u201cCities that are now pillars of the modern globalised economy\u2014Mumbai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai\u2014were initially sustained by opium,\u201d writes Mr Ghosh. Colonial policies continue to shape regional disparities in India. In what is now Bihar, the EIC ruthlessly exploited peasant farmers, whereas in Malwa, another opium-producing area, it was unable to exert as much power. The regions\u2019 health, education and crime statistics reflect their historical differences. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As Mr Ghosh marvels at opium\u2019s ability \u201cto spin off new and more potent versions of itself\u201d, including its synthetic analogue, fentanyl, his emphasis on the drug\u2019s degree of agency can feel exaggerated. (He also has a weakness for the phrase \u201cand so on\u201d.) But he tells his intricate story with verve. Anger bubbles up, as he points the finger at multinational companies whose success is tied to the opium trade.

Addiction often returns. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 66}
