A supporter of Mr Corbyn, he was elected in 2019 on a Labour ticket; after an acrimonious split, he is standing in May as an independent. How Mr Driscoll fares will help to gauge whether anger among left-wing activists at Sir Keir\u2019s tack to the centre ahead of a general election can translate into a serious threat at the ballot box. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He faces a hard task. History is littered with failed left-wing bids to usurp Labour. The party is riding high in national polls.

He has raised \u00a3165,000 ($207,000), a chunky sum by British standards. He can present himself as both an outsider railing at the Labour establishment and an insider who has wrung a bumper devolution deal out of Whitehall (\u201cWe get more money than Manchester,\u201d he boasts). And the north-east, though long Labour-leaning, has occasionally given the party high-ups a bloody nose: in 2004, 78% of voters rejected a regional assembly, Sir Tony Blair\u2019s early attempt at devolution. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Driscoll levels two charges at Sir Keir. The first is resiling from the principles on which he became leader in 2020: by embracing private health-care providers, being too \u201cweasel-worded\u201d on the war in Gaza, shying away from extending child benefit and trimming a green industrial plan originally priced at \u00a328bn a year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second concerns party democracy. Mr Driscoll was barred as a candidate ostensibly for sharing a stage with Ken Loach, a left-wing film-maker who is now persona non grata, having dismissed Labour\u2019s crisis over antisemitism as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. Sir Keir\u2019s circle have been proudly ruthless in intervening in bits of the party they regarded as falling short. The price, complain some on the left, has been ideological uniformity in a once broad church. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though the electoral odds are stacked against Mr Driscoll, his campaign points to a potential longer-term problem for Sir Keir. A 20-point poll lead and the allure of government have so far persuaded most of the party to swallow the compromises he insists are necessary for victory. Yet some MPs quietly warn that within a couple of years he will be at risk if he sticks to them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Corbyn was popular with many Labour members not because they were ideologically rigid, but because he spoke to broad ideals, such as reducing inequality, that Sir Keir reflected in 2020: more Lennon than Lenin, as Tom Baldwin, Sir Keir\u2019s biographer, puts it. In Jarrow, Mr Driscoll cites as the litmus tests for a Labour government whether it can reduce health-service waiting lists and ease the state of \u201cdestitution\u201d that some locals are in."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A theme of the past decade in British politics has been the Conservative government\u2019s battle to contain insurgent forces on its right.
