But as the annual gathering of bigwigs got under way, a series of additional blows fell. First came the death of Alexei Navalny, Russia\u2019s foremost opposition leader, in a Siberian gulag on February 16th. The next day Ukraine\u2019s army withdrew from the town of Avdiivka, handing Mr Putin his first military victory in almost a year. America\u2019s Congress, meanwhile, showed no sign of passing a bill to dispense more military aid to Ukraine, which is starved of ammunition and therefore likely to suffer more setbacks on the battlefield.

A week earlier Mr Trump had explained what he would say to an ally in nato that had not spent as much as the alliance urges on defence and then suffered an invasion: \u201cYou\u2019re delinquent?

Mr Pistorius is correct that European arms production is rising fast; the continent should be able to produce shells at an annual rate of 1m-2m late this year, potentially outstripping America. But that may come too late for Ukraine, which needs some 1.5m per year according to Rheinmetall, a European arms manufacturer. A sense of wartime urgency is still lacking. European shell-makers export 40% of their production to non-EU countries other than Ukraine; when the European Commission proposed that Ukraine should be prioritised by law, member states refused.

In 2019 Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, told this newspaper that allies needed to \u201creassess the reality of what NATO is in the light of the commitment of the United States\u201d. Mr Trump\u2019s first term in office, in which he flirted with withdrawing from NATO and publicly sided with Mr Putin over his own intelligence agencies, served as a catalyst. The idea of European \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d, once pushed only by France, was embraced by other countries. Defence spending, which began rising after Russia\u2019s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, has increased dramatically. That year just three members of NATO met the alliance\u2019s target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. Last year 11 countries did, ten of them in Europe (see chart 1). This year at least 18 of NATO\u2019s 28 European members will hit the target. Europe\u2019s total defence spending will reach around $380bn\u2014about the same as Russia\u2019s, after adjusting for Europe\u2019s higher prices. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those numbers flatter Europe, however. Its defence spending yields disproportionately little combat power, and its armed forces are less than the sum of their parts. The continent is years away from being able to defend itself from attack by a reconstituted Russian force. At last year\u2019s summit, NATO leaders approved their first comprehensive national defence plans since the cold war. NATO officials say those plans require Europe to increase its existing (and unmet) targets for military capability by about a third. That, in turn, means Europe would have to spend around 50% more on defence than today, or about 3% of GDP. The only European members of NATO that currently reach that level are Poland and Greece, the latter flattered by bloated military pensions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Anyway, more money is not enough. Almost all European armies are struggling to meet their recruitment targets, as is America\u2019s. Moreover the rise in spending after 2014 delivered alarmingly little growth in combat capability. A recent paper by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), a think-tank in London, found that the number of combat battalions had barely increased since 2015 (France and Germany each added just one) or had even fallen, in Britain by five battalions. At a conference last year, an American general lamented that most European countries could field just one full-strength brigade (a formation of a few thousand troops), if that. Germany\u2019s bold decision to deploy a full brigade to Lithuania, for instance, is likely to stretch its army severely. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even when Europe can produce combat forces, they often lack the things needed to fight effectively for long periods: command-and-control capabilities, such as staff officers trained to run large headquarters; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, such as drones and satellites; logistics capabilities, including airlift; and ammunition to last for longer than a week or so. \u201cThe things that European militaries can do, they can do really well,\u201d says Michael Kofman, a military expert, \u201cbut they typically can\u2019t do a lot of them, they can\u2019t do them for very long and they\u2019re configured for the initial period of a war that the United States would lead.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Poland is an instructive case. It is the poster boy for European rearmament. It will spend 4% of its GDP on defence this year, and splurges more than half of that money on equipment, far above NATO\u2019s target of 20%. It is buying huge numbers of tanks, helicopters, howitzers and HIMARS rocket artillery\u2014on the face of it, just what Europe needs. But under the previous government, says Konrad Muzyka, a defence analyst, it did so with little coherent planning and utter neglect of how to crew and sustain the equipment, with personnel numbers falling. Poland\u2019s HIMARS launchers can hit targets 300km away, but its intelligence platforms cannot see that far. It relies on America for that."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One option would be for Europeans to pool their resources. For the past 16 years, for instance, a group of 12 European countries have jointly bought and operated a fleet of three long-range cargo aircraft\u2014essentially a timeshare programme for airlift. In January Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain teamed up to order 1,000 of the missiles used in the Patriot air-defence system, diving down the cost through bulk. The same approach could be taken in other areas, such as reconnaissance satellites."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The hitch is that countries with big defence industries\u2014France, Germany, Italy and Spain\u2014often fail to agree on how contracts should be split among their national arms-makers. There is also a trade-off between plugging holes quickly and building up the continent\u2019s own defence industry. France is irked by a recent German-led scheme, the European Sky Shield Initiative, in which 21 European countries jointly buy air-defence systems, in part because it involves buying American and Israeli launchers alongside German ones. When Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, recently called for Europe to adopt a \u201cwar economy\u201d, Benjamin Haddad, a French lawmaker in Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Renaissance party, retorted, \u201cIt\u2019s not by buying American equipment that we\u2019re going to get there.\u201d European arms-makers, he argued, will not hire workers and build production lines if they do not get orders.

Europe\u2019s defence industry is less fragmented than many assume, says Jan Joel Andersson of the EU Institute for Security Studies in a recent paper: the continent makes fewer types of fighter jets and airborne radar planes than America, for instance. But there are inefficiencies. Countries often have different design priorities. France wants carrier-capable jets and lighter armoured vehicles; Germany prefers longer-range aircraft and heavier tanks. Europe-wide co-operation on tanks has consistently failed, writes Mr Andersson, and an ongoing Franco-German effort is in doubt.

If America were to sever all co-operation, British nuclear forces \u201cwould probably have a life expectancy measured in months rather than years\u201d, according to an assessment published ten years ago. In contrast, France\u2019s deterrent is entirely home-grown and more aloof from NATO: uniquely among NATO\u2019s members, France does not participate in the NPG, though it has long said that its arsenal, \u201cby its existence\u201d, contributes to the alliance\u2019s security.

More radically, if the American umbrella had gone entirely, France could invite European partners to participate in nuclear operations, such as providing escort aircraft for bombers, joining a task force with the eventual successor to the Charles de Gaulle aircraft-carrier, which can host nukes, or even basing a few missiles in Germany.

An alternative would be for Europeans to inherit the rump NATO structures and keep the alliance alive without America.
