Applicants must possess an unimpeachable academic record. Marc Tessier-Lavigne resigned as president of Stanford University in July 2023 after a report found serious problems with the neuroscientist\u2019s research. They must also be able diplomats in America\u2019s culture wars. In December Liz Magill was chastised by lawmakers in a hearing on campus antisemitism, and resigned from her role as president of the University of Pennsylvania days later. Claudine Gay, whose tenure as president of Harvard University lasted six months, fell at both hurdles. She was seen as weak on antisemitism by donors and resigned on January 2nd after a plagiarism scandal erupted over her work. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Changes at the helm of America\u2019s universities are common. According to the American Council on Education, an industry association, the average tenure of a university president in 2022 was six years, indicating that hundreds of jobs change hands each year. Yet the number of vacancies at America\u2019s most prestigious schools is striking. Yale\u2019s president will also step down this summer after 11 years in the job; so will the chancellors of the publicly funded University of California, Los Angeles, and Berkeley. That leaves six of the top universities in the world searching for a new president. These institutions are responsible for shepherding some of the world\u2019s biggest brains (Nobel prizewinners) and also some of its most impressionable (the coddled offspring of America\u2019s elite). That\u2019s to say nothing of their hospitals, thousands of administrative staff and $160bn of endowments."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The search is on. At private universities, the responsibility falls on the board of trustees. Many university boards look similar to those of America\u2019s corporate giants, packed with financial luminaries. A broader committee, including faculty and students, is sometimes tasked with aiding the search. Specialist headhunters are often called. Fierce competition for candidates, who are usually found running big faculties or lesser universities, is not the only reason boards are daunted by the prospect. America\u2019s universities, which are at the centre of toxic debates over free speech and diversity, are suffering from a crisis of legitimacy that has put the presidential office under a microscope, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The top job at a university has long had its frustrations. Beyond directing donors\u2019 dollars and making a few big hiring decisions, university presidents wield surprisingly little formal power. Unlike the boss of a company, they find their most senior employees protected by tenure, which makes it almost impossible to remove experienced faculty members. \u201cThe glib answer is that they live in a very large house and beg for money,\u201d says Richard Chait, a professor at Harvard. A 1949 editorial in The American Scholar described the job as an exercise in \u201cadvertising, selling and hoarding\u201d; Clark Kerr, a mid-century Berkeley chancellor, quipped that the role involved providing parking for the faculty, sex for the students and athletics for the alumni. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Kerr\u2019s summation points to a deeper truth\u2014that a university president\u2019s job is mainly about keeping a motley crew of interested parties happy. Achieving that balance is becoming nearly impossible. A 2003 paper by Edward Glaeser, an economist, suggests that as non-profit institutions become wealthier, power shifts from their providers of capital (donors) to their workers (faculty). Although that may have been a reasonable description of the decline of donors\u2019 power during the 20th century, the financial backers of America\u2019s universities are now reasserting their influence with a vengeance. Some, displeased with how Ms Gay and Ms Magill handled antisemitism on campus, were instrumental in ousting them. Ken Griffin, a hedge-fund titan whose name adorns Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, recently said he had halted his financial contributions to the university. At the same time students, who are meant to be instructed by universities, are instead pushing them around. Few think these pressures will subside any time soon. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One option is to rethink the duties of the president. That could involve limiting their ability to make political statements, or reinforcing their obligation to free speech and merit. Boards are, however, more likely to approach the problem through their choice of appointee than through constitutional change. A candidate\u2019s ability to placate donors or appear on the congressional stage will be closely scrutinised. That trustees will undertake more thorough due diligence of prospects\u2019 academic records is assured. Despite the challenges of the job, boards will not encounter a dearth of applicants from within academia for these distinguished posts. But might they look outside universities altogether?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some may consider a business leader an attractive choice, particularly to deal with the administrative bloat that now afflicts many universities. After all, the operating budgets of America\u2019s largest universities are now similar to those of a Fortune 500 company. Yet America\u2019s businesses have not shown themselves to be any better at navigating the country\u2019s culture wars. A former politician, another possibility, may know how to gladhand donors and schmooze with journalists, but would be a lightning rod for criticism from supporters of whichever party they did not represent. In both cases, the outsider would struggle to win the respect of the faculty through whom they must work."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Searching for meaning"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The truth is that the background of applicants is not the problem. An identity crisis is engulfing America\u2019s universities. They are torn between their responsibilities to learning and social justice\u2014and that is a tension any president governing by consensus will find hard to resolve. This carries wider lessons for all organisations. Institutions unmoored from a clear purpose, whether that is knowledge-seeking or profit-seeking, are destined for crises. Even the cleverest captain would struggle to steer such a ship. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Schumpeter, our columnist on global business:The row over US Steel shows the new meaning of national security (Feb 16th)Musk v Zuckerberg: who\u2019s winning?
