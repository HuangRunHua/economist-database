Mr Hammersley suggested a few names for it. Fortunately \u201caudioblogging\u201d and \u201cGuerillaMedia\u201d did not catch on. But a third did: podcasting, a portmanteau of \u201ciPod\u201d and \u201cbroadcasting\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At a tech conference the next year, Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s boss, asked how many people in the audience had heard of podcasting, which he described as \u201c\u2018Wayne\u2019s World\u2019 for radio\u201d. Not a single person raised their hand. But today, 20 years after they got their name, podcasts are mainstream. Around 43% of American internet users and 30% of Britons listen to at least one a month (including some from The Economist). You can open Apple, Spotify and, increasingly, YouTube to find some 4m shows by everyone from ex-convicts to duchesses. Podcasting has turned anyone with a microphone into a talking head who can talk straight into people\u2019s earbuds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like butt-dialling and doom-scrolling, the podcasting boom was facilitated by the smartphone. The iPhone was released in 2007; the first standalone podcast apps came out between 2010 and 2012. In 2014 \u201cSerial\u201d, a binge-worthy investigation into the botched murder trial of a teenager in Maryland, arrived; it was the first show to gain attention in mainstream American culture.

The number of monthly podcast listeners in America doubled in the five years after 2014."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since \u201cSerial\u201d, podcasting has been in a \u201chyper-charged, hyper-capitalist, hyper-speculative period\u201d, says Nicholas Quah, a podcast critic.

Economic headwinds were one factor. But advertisers and investors also realised that they know relatively little about how many people actually listen to podcasts: \u201cdownloads\u201d, the standard industry metric for engagement, do not always equate to listening. Spotify eliminated 200 podcasting jobs; others followed suit. Many well-regarded shows were cancelled, including \u201cStolen\u201d, which won the Pulitzer prize for audio journalism in 2023.

Podcasts offer something traditional formats often work hard to leave out, but which, as trust in media has fallen, audiences crave: transparency. Instead of formal interviews, listeners get sprawling conversations. Instead of radio features measured in minutes, listeners are led through whole investigations over hours. \u201cIn exposing the vulnerabilities of the reportorial process, the news product becomes more credible and trustworthy,\u201d writes David Dowling in \u201cPodcast Journalism\u201d, a forthcoming book.
