Pokrovsk, a hardscrabble mining spot 45km north-west of Avdiivka (see map), is now crammed with soldiers, many of whom have just retreated from the fallen town. Russian attacks in the hours after the retreat are said to have killed five people in three other eastern towns. Even though these places are set back from the front, the sound of artillery in all of them is clear. It never lets up for long.

Although its fall is a setback, Major Rodion Kudriashov, deputy commander of the 3rd Assault Brigade, which helped cover the retreat, says he takes the long view, having battled the Russians since 2014. \u201cWe have lost a small battle,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we have not lost the war.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The question is whether Russia\u2019s forces will press home their advantage and surge forward from Avdiivka, or turn to attack elsewhere. On February 19th there were reports of attacks in several sectors. But Major Kudriashov does not believe that the Russians can continue to press forward from Avdiivka. For even as the Ukrainian forces withdrew, they were able to inflict heavy blows on the enemy. According to Oleksandr Tarnavsky, the overall commander of the sector, 47,000 Russians were killed or injured in four months of battle for Avdiivka, a figure that is impossible to verify. Ukrainian forces do not give their own casualty numbers, though Major Kudriashov claims they were far lower.

Ukrainian troops did not have enough ammunition to strike them all, but half of them did not make it, he says. Major Kudriashov notes that the Russians prevailed because they had an 11-fold advantage in terms of artillery and, in the 12 days before the fall, dropped 60 massively destructive guided aerial bombs a day. He thinks that if Ukrainian forces had had more equipment and ammunition the battle of Avdiivka would have ended \u201centirely differently\u201d.
