The problem is simply put: Russia is becoming more dangerous, America is less reliable and Europe remains unprepared. But the scale of the solution is hard to comprehend. European leaders urgently need to jettison their post-Soviet complacency. That means raising defence spending to a level not seen in decades, restoring Europe\u2019s neglected military traditions, restructuring its arms industries and preparing for a possible war. Russia is much poorer and less populous than Europe. But the bear can still spread destruction and misery. We argue that the best place to stop Mr Putin is in Ukraine. Yet even if that succeeds, Europe will have to think very differently about defence. It needs to start now."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240224_DE_UK.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1684.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Leader: Is Europe ready to defend itself?Briefing: Can Europe defend itself without America?Europe: How Boris Pistorius is transforming the German armed forces"}], "id": 3}
