In the past few weeks it has begun to boil over with fury and mockery. The prospect of American tariffs of over 60% on Chinese imports? \u201cAdd even more,\u201d rages one online commentator in the mainland. \u201cI\u2019d be curious to see how ordinary Americans would live.\u201d Others think Mr Trump would increase the odds of a war. The world will \u201cnever be at peace\u201d with him around, reckons another netizen. \u201cThis old madman is too vicious,\u201d says a third. \u201cHe must be annihilated.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is not just online: the prospect of a Trump victory is the subject of debate among China\u2019s elite, too. They fear his return to the White House would lead to an even hotter trade war, with potentially vast economic costs. But they also believe his contempt for alliances (witness the latest outburst against NATO) could yield huge propaganda gains and undermine the American-led security system in Asia, freeing China to act as it pleases on Taiwan and more. Some Chinese nationalists are cheering his successes and call him Comrade Chuan Jianguo: Chuan being a common rendering of Mr Trump\u2019s surname, and Jianguo meaning \u201cbuild the country\u201d. It is a way of suggesting that Mr Trump\u2019s excesses make China stronger."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, the unpredictable trade-offs that a Trump presidency would involve are especially difficult to weigh, even if the two men\u2019s relationship is reasonable enough after multiple encounters from banquets in Beijing to steak dinners at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump\u2019s lair in Florida. \u201cI like President Xi a lot,\u201d Mr Trump recently told Fox News. \u201cHe was a very good friend of mine during my term.\u201d On the one hand Mr Trump\u2019s presidency from 2017 to 2021 saw a profound shift in America\u2019s policy. His administration deployed tariffs in an attempt to reduce America\u2019s trade deficit and protect jobs. It redefined the domestic debate in America, with China portrayed as a political, technological and military adversary. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the other hand Mr Biden\u2019s more systematic approach to governing has posed a different kind of threat to China than that of Mr Trump\u2019s first term. America has kept the Trump tariffs in place, but on top of that also built a comprehensive system for restricting Western technology flows to China. And by investing in America\u2019s security partnerships and alliances, from Australia and India to the Philippines and South Korea, it has rejuvenated an Asian security system to deter and contain China. Mr Biden may be known as Shui Wang, or Sleepy King, in China.

You might imagine that after four years in office, the MAGA appetite to confront China would be sated. Yet the available signals suggest that opposition to China in Mr Trump\u2019s inner circle may have intensified. Take the views of Robert Lighthizer, Mr Trump\u2019s influential trade representative, who could get a top job again in the White House. In the period from 2017 to 2021 he launched an investigation into Chinese theft of intellectual property and invoked Section 301 of America\u2019s trade law, which allows the president to punish trade partners that do not play fair, in order to raise tariffs. The average tariff faced by Chinese firms rose from 3% in 2018 to 21% by the end of 2019, when the two countries struck a truce (see chart 1)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Lighthizer\u2019s position remains intensely hostile to China, whose totalitarian instincts, he argues, pose an ever greater danger. In a book published last year, \u201cNo Trade is Free\u201d, he argues China is \u201cthe greatest threat that the American nation and its system of Western liberal democratic government has faced since the American revolution\u201d. The book contains several tough proposals, including screening of Chinese investments not just on security grounds but also for \u201clong-term economic harm\u201d; the prohibition of any Chinese company from operating in America unless there is reciprocal access for American firms in China; and the banning of TikTok, a Chinese-owned short-video app."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Crucially, Mr Lighthizer recommends another huge increase in tariffs. The goal, he argues, should be \u201cbalanced trade\u201d\u2014that is, presumably, no goods-trade deficit at all. Last year China still enjoyed a surplus with America of nearly $280bn, down from a record $419bn in 2018, but not far off the $347bn before Mr Trump took office. To correct this Mr Lighthizer calls for the undoing of \u201cone of the worst mistakes\u201d in America\u2019s history: its decision to enter into \u201cpermanent normal trade relations\u201d (PNTR) with China in 2000. This allowed China to pay the same low tariffs America charges most of its trading partners, rather than an alternative, steeper set of levies that appear in \u201ccolumn 2\u201d of America\u2019s tariff schedule and apply to only a handful of countries such as Cuba and North Korea, and now Russia and Belarus."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ending PNTR with China would raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 61% on average, according to Oxford Economics, a consultancy, assuming the Section 301 tariffs remain in place. For Chinese mobile phones, tariffs would jump from 0% to 35%; for Chinese toys from 0% to 70%. Instead of settling for the existing column 2 tariffs, America might write a new tariff schedule just for China. That could be even stricter on some goods (such as cars) but less restrictive on other products dear to American consumers, such as Apple iPhones.

One guide is the past. At its height, the trade war knocked as much as 0.8% off China\u2019s quarterly GDP, according to Goldman Sachs, a bank, equivalent to roughly $40bn in today\u2019s dollars. Overall, the net trade effect was negative for China and positive for America. But the conflict eroded the incomes of both Chinese and Americans by raising prices, disrupted financial markets in each country and led to policy uncertainty that inhibited business spending (see chart 2). During negotiations with China, Mr Trump liked to be both the arsonist and the firefighter, as one observer put it, starting conflagrations with angry tweets and then dousing them with diplomatic dinners. These zigzags spooked global markets. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another guide to the potential cost is modelling. Repeal of PNTR would shrink America\u2019s expected share of China\u2019s exports from about a fifth under existing policies to about 3%, according to Oxford Economics (see chart 3). There are many moving parts to such simulations. One consideration is whether firms believe that new Trump tariffs would be maintained after he left office, as was the case last time (see Finance &amp; economics section). Another is that some Chinese components would still find their way into America\u2019s market embedded in goods assembled by other countries. China\u2019s economy and financial markets are in dismal shape compared with 2017. And it is not clear how China would retaliate: doing so during the first Trump presidency did not force America to back down. Oxford Economics assumes that China would raise its tariffs by about 17 percentage points on average. All in all, the once-intimate economic relationship between the superpowers could be reduced to an air-kiss."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240224_CNC451.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 742.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Either way, the kind of decoupling that Mr Trump\u2019s advisers envisage would inflict profound damage on China\u2019s economy. Studies by JaeBin Ahn and other economists at the IMF show what would happen if the world splits into rival economic spheres with limited flows of foreign-direct investment between them. If such flows were to fall by half, it could eventually reduce China\u2019s GDP by about 2%, relative to a baseline in which investment flows more freely. Another study by Carlos G\u00f3es of the University of California, San Diego, and Eddy Bekers of the World Trade Organisation argues that tariff increases of around 30% could lower China\u2019s income by over 5% by 2040.

He resents the Western-led world order and wants to establish China as an alternative centre of power. Mr Trump\u2019s tempestuous relationship with America\u2019s allies in Europe and Asia may undermine cohesion with them on China policy if he is elected again. His contemptuous remarks about NATO, including his recent suggestion that he would not offer American protection to allies who fail to spend enough on defence, are music to China\u2019s ears. It sees NATO as a cold-war relic that the West uses to preserve its dominance. For the same reason, it relishes any tension in America\u2019s relationships with Japan and South Korea, such as Mr Trump caused by threatening the withdrawal of American troops from those countries if their governments would not agree to big increases in their contributions to the cost of maintaining the bases. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A Trump administration might unwind the work Mr Biden has done to nurture Asian partnerships. To China\u2019s chagrin, he created a new grouping, known as AUKUS, aimed at strengthening co-operation with Australia and Britain in responding to the security challenge posed by China\u2019s navy in the Indian Ocean and Pacific. China, inaccurately, calls it \u201cNATO-like\u201d. Still, AUKUS involves exactly the kind of long-term, rather than transactional, relationship that Mr Trump dislikes.

Mr Biden has sometimes gone beyond the conventional, ambivalent, language about America\u2019s commitments to the island. He has said repeatedly that American troops would defend Taiwan if China invaded, only for his aides to walk back his comments after Chinese outrage. Mr Trump is probably far less enthusiastic about protecting the island. In his memoir, John Bolton, who served as Mr Trump\u2019s national security adviser in 2018 and 2019 before a bitter parting of ways, wrote of Mr Trump\u2019s \u201cgrousing\u201d about weapons sales to Taiwan.

Mr Xi will be watching the vote counts in November closely: the two likely candidates present China with very different challenges. But even as he waits for a result, he will know that however divided American politics may be, hostility towards China is now a bipartisan matter, and deeply entrenched. For him and for America the election cycle is part of a longer-term struggle. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 18}
