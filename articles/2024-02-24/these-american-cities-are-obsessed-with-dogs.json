Precious pups are carted around in prams. Spot isn\u2019t just a dog, he is a \u201cfur baby\u201d. Except he is probably not called Spot. Human names for pets are en vogue. There is even some overlap between the top-ten names for dogs and babies. \u201cLuna\u201d and \u201cTheodore\u201d grace both lists, though for dogs it is the cuddlier \u201cTeddy\u201d.

But San Francisco is not the only place where this may be true (Denver claims more pups than tots too). Nor is it even close to the most dog-obsessed area in America.

San Francisco is not one of them. What explains which places are pup-sessed? There is no clear geographical trend. The cities with the biggest gaps between the number of homes with dogs and those with kids are in the Sunbelt. But Detroit, Seattle and Philadelphia are just behind. There is a correlation, however, between household space and high rates of dog ownership. Dogs are more prevalent in cities where single-family homes are common. Just 22% of homes in New York City have a dog. Pity the pup cooped up in a closet-sized flat in Tribeca. The paw thing would go barking mad.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with The , our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and Checks and Balance, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 25}
