He and his fianc\u00e9e had split up just two months before their wedding, and he wanted to escape. So he chose a mountain refuge to which a growing number of Chinese were fleeing, seeking a different kind of Chinese dream. The ancient town became known as \u201cDalifornia\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some of the new arrivals were writers and political dissidents, but many were refugees from modernity. The reason most of them left cities, writes Mr Ash, \u201cis not communist control so much as capitalist excess\u201d. China\u2019s boom has improved people\u2019s lives. But now some citizens are stepping back from the \u201cgospel of development\u201d and asking, \u201cWhat was it all for? I\u2019m richer, but am I happy?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The numbers are still small, but the trickle represents a rejection of what upwardly mobile Chinese held dear for four decades: \u201cIt had taken just two generations for a Chinese family to pass from pre-industrial agrarianism to post-material urban malaise.\u201d For years farmers migrated to cities and tried to shift their hukou (household registration) to get better health care and education. Now urbanites are doing the reverse."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some are hippies. Others are Chinese yuppies fed up with the social expectations of earning more and pushing their children to achieve, part of a trend known as fugu (a return to old ways). All are taking advantage of Dali\u2019s remoteness. The book\u2019s title invokes an old saying, \u201cThe mountains are high and the emperor far away.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The author sets out to reinvent himself, too. What could have been a laboured tale of a foreigner in rural China is mercifully kept as a sideshow. Mr Ash (who used to be a contributor to The Economist) emerges from the year a changed man. China, less so. \u201cThe paradox of Dali was that we were trying to find freedom in an unfree state,\u201d he writes. The parties continue, but so does the Communist Party. Those who can get from Dalifornia to California still do.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 69}
