There was a strut in the step of the propaganda chief of Ningdu county, in the orange-growing hills of Jiangxi province, as he welcomed 66 couples to a collective marriage ceremony on February 17th. Though the men and women were all dressed in traditional red wedding robes, this was a Communist Party gathering. It began with expressions of respect for Xi Jinping, the supreme leader. Standing in Ningdu\u2019s main square, watched by their families and a throng of curious locals, the couples read a wedding oath from a large video screen. They pledged to love one another, to care for their respective parents, to educate their children and to heed the call of the party and government to build a contented, civilised China. The term civilised is a clue. The couples were not just enjoying a free party. They were now recruits in a nationwide ideological campaign, intended to stamp out \u201cunhealthy\u201d traditions and carry \u201csocialist spiritual civilisation\u201d into every home, especially those in rural areas."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bad habits targeted by the campaign vary from place to place, but its stated goal is the same everywhere: to solve real-life problems so that \u201cthe masses personally feel that the Communist Party is good\u201d. A banner on stage spelled out the mission of Ningdu\u2019s collective wedding. It read: \u201cNo to bride prices, yes to happiness\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ningdu is not rich. Like many counties in Jiangxi, it is notorious for high bride prices, or caili. Before they can marry off a son, many rural families have to find, or borrow, as much as 200,000 yuan ($27,800) to give to the bride\u2019s parents. This is a heavy burden for some villagers and yet another barrier to marriage for rural males, in a country where men now outnumber women by almost 35m after decades of selective abortions. Jiangxi leaders have duly added high bride prices, along with costly village weddings (and funerals) to their list of outdated habits that must change."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Mr Xi\u2019s China, once an ideological campaign is set in motion, little is left to chance. Ningdu\u2019s mass wedding addressed local concerns. But when a bridegroom was called to the stage to express gratitude to the party, and urge young people to embrace \u201ca new culture of civilisation\u201d, those were national slogans. Flying video cameras buzzed overhead, for Chinese propaganda outlets love drone footage filmed from above. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "From his vantage point near the stage, Chaguan watched the drones and imagined them pulling back for a long shot. Fly high enough over Ningdu\u2019s main square and the next node of this campaign would come into view: the town\u2019s New Era Civilisation Practice Centre. A party-run ideological training hub, it is attached to a memorial hall that honours Red Army fighters from the 1930s. China\u2019s first such centres opened in 2018 as a pilot. The campaign was expanded to the whole country in 2021. Following a hierarchy repeated nationwide, Ningdu\u2019s civilisation-practice network has one full-scale centre, supported by 25 offices and 338 stations at neighbourhood level, covering a county with 700,000 residents."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Should the drone swoop down on a neighbourhood station, it would find it manned by a few propaganda officials and squads of volunteers. A party directive from 2019 suggested that 13% of all residents should volunteer at civilisation-practice bases. Some activities are benign: water-safety lessons for children, fan-dance classes for pensioners. Volunteers deliver shopping to the old. Other activities are bossier. Villages nationwide have established \u201cRed and White Committees\u201d to promote frugal weddings and funerals, sometimes held in communal canteens. The People\u2019s Daily, the party\u2019s mouthpiece, praised a village in Hubei province that evaluates households annually as \u201chonest\u201d or \u201cdishonest\u201d, with honest families given credits to exchange for goods in a \u201cpoints supermarket\u201d. It cited a man who accepted village mediation of a dispute with neighbours to avoid losing points. That said, the \u201cpoints supermarket\u201d seen by your columnist in a Jiangxi civilisation-practice station was underwhelming: a glass-fronted cupboard holding packets of soap, laundry powder and toothpaste."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If the drone flies higher, it would see how local campaigns reflect the ambitions of party chiefs. Mr Xi has drawn connections between large problems, such as falling marriage and birth rates, and grassroots work to \u201cstrengthen guidance on young people\u2019s views of marriage, childbirth and family\u201d. Civilised-practice grids have appeared, as that campaign joins another: the Xi-era grid management scheme for monitoring individual neighbourhoods."}, {"role": "second", "text": "A problem-solving, all-knowing party"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Clearly, the party is serious about its mission to be felt and seen in every home. Yet return to the ground in Ningdu and the picture becomes blurrier. For one thing, that mass wedding looks very different in close-up. A clue came when a young child ran to a supposedly newlywed couple. \u201cMama,\u201d he laughed, and hid under her robes. When asked, other couples admitted to being married for years. A red-robed groom said that he married a decade ago and was taking part \u201cto help the propaganda department\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another bridegroom turned out to be newly married, at least. Then he confessed to having hosted a wedding banquet for \u201c200 or 300 people\u201d, undermining the day\u2019s emphasis on frugality. High bride prices \u201creally are bad\u201d, the young man continued, especially if a bride\u2019s parents keep the money and do not pass it to the new couple. But he ascribed China\u2019s falling marriage rates to larger problems. Men who move to cities encounter \u201cfierce competition\u201d and unaffordable housing. But if they stay in rural areas, \u201cthere are basically no girls of marriageable age\u201d. He endorsed the civilisation campaign, though he suspects that changing deep-rooted customs may take a generation. \u201cSince I am a party member, I must take part in this kind of activity,\u201d he revealed, unbidden."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Xi has increased his party\u2019s reach into everyday lives, tackling practical problems as a way to strengthen social controls.
