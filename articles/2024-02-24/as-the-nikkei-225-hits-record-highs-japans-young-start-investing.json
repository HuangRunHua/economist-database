Her pay, at just \u00a5160,000 ($1,100) a month, was meagre; after bills, rent, shopping and a few holidays, she had little left over. So in 2020 she decided to buy some stocks. \u201cI used to think it was too risky,\u201d says Ms Saito, who learned about investing via books and YouTube. \u201cBut it was amazing to see my assets grow.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although Ms Saito\u2019s story would be unremarkable anywhere else, it is part of a sea change in Japan. According to surveys by the Investment Trusts Association, 23% of people in their twenties invested in mutual funds last year, up from 6% in 2016. So did 29% of people in their thirties, up from 10%\u2014a bigger rise than in any other age group. Those with exposure to the Nikkei 225, which on February 22nd passed a record high set in 1989, are reaping the rewards."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240224_FNC505.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Japan\u2019s officials, who want to boost economic growth, have long desired such a shift. The public\u2019s previous aversion to retail investing dates back to the early 1990s, when a stockmarket bubble burst. In the ensuing decades, with inflation minimal or non-existent, low-risk saving came to be seen as virtuous. Some 54% of Japanese household assets are in cash or deposits, against 31% in Britain and 13% in America.

This aims to create a virtuous cycle: companies will grow by making use of funds from retail investors; individuals will enjoy the benefits of their growth. As part of the initiative, in January the government improved the terms of its NISA programme, modelled on Britain\u2019s ISA, which exempts retail investors from capital-gains taxes. The same month 900,000 new NISA accounts were opened with the country\u2019s five biggest investment platforms.

Under Japan\u2019s zero-interest-rate policy, hoarding cash in a bank brings almost no return. This has been true for a while, but inflation now stands at around 3%\u2014a three-decade high\u2014meaning the value of cash not put to work is being eroded.

One problem for Mr Kishida is that many youngsters favour international markets over domestic ones. For instance, Ms Saito\u2019s investments include Apple (an American tech giant), the s&amp;p 500 (an index of big American firms) and BioNTech (a German vaccine-maker). Yet perhaps she and others will change their approach if the Nikkei continues to soar. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 58}
