Yet that is not much of a lifeline, since Congo\u2019s neighbour is largely responsible for the current crisis, which has already sucked in troops from at least six countries and risks exploding into a full-blown regional war. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly escalating,\u201d says Pierre Boisselet, a conflict researcher at Ebuteli, a Congolese think-tank, warning of the risk of a direct confrontation between foreign armies on Congolese soil. That is an alarming prospect, because the previous time this happened after a Rwandan invasion of Congo in 1998, the resulting war lasted until 2003 and claimed between 1m and 5m lives, mostly because of disease and starvation induced by the conflict. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rwanda\u2019s main complaint is that Congo has sheltered and co-operates with the FDLR, a Hutu militia whose original leaders included army officers responsible for the genocide of Rwanda\u2019s Tutsi minority in 1994. M23 traces its roots to earlier rebellions led by Tutsis. In 2012, with Rwandan backing, it captured Goma before Congolese and UN troops drove it out again. But the group sprang back to life in late 2021 and swiftly captured swathes of North Kivu. It accuses Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi of failing to honour an earlier peace deal, and of overseeing discrimination and attacks against Tutsis."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A bewildering mishmash of forces defends Goma. Congo\u2019s notoriously ill-paid and poorly equipped army fights alongside an assortment of militias known collectively as Wazalendo (\u201cpatriots\u201d in Swahili, the east\u2019s dominant language). European private military contractors staffed by, among others, former members of the French Foreign Legion, are contracted to provide training and technical support to Congo\u2019s army. They have also sometimes helped it plan operations. Burundi, a neighbour of both Congo and Rwanda\u2014 which has dire relations with the latter\u2014has also deployed more than 1,000 troops to fight alongside the Congolese army. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are also some 16,300 UN peacekeepers in Congo, whom Wazalendo sometimes shoot at due to deep distrust of the role of the international community. And last is a military mission recently dispatched by SADC, the regional bloc, which will have 2,900 South African troops in addition to forces from Tanzania and Malawi. If that were not complicated enough, Uganda, which played a leading part in previous Congo wars, has an ambiguous role in the current drama. It has looked the other way as M23 fighters moved across its territory and into Congo, for example."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To prevent this tinder box igniting, America has repeatedly tried to broker a peace deal by getting Congo to stop arming the FDLR and Rwanda to pull back its forces. Yet in fact Rwanda has doubled down in its proxy war against Congo and the various peacekeeping forces and missions deployed there. On February 4th a South African peacekeeper was killed when a UN helicopter was fired on while it was flying to Goma. Almost two weeks later a mortar barrage killed two more South African soldiers, who were among the advance elements of the SADC mission.

That seems plausible given Rwanda\u2019s other actions. Earlier this month a drone launched from Rwanda bombed Goma\u2019s airport and Rwandan forces fired an anti-aircraft missile at a UN surveillance drone in Congo, according to a confidential report by the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo. That prompted an unusually stern denunciation from America, which called on Rwanda to withdraw its troops and, in particular, its anti-aircraft missile systems \u201cwhich threaten the lives of civilians, UN and other regional peacekeepers, humanitarian actors, and commercial flights\u201d.

In December UN experts provided evidence that M23 fighters had received training in Rwanda, and showed aerial photographs of Rwandan army columns marching through Congolese territory. High-tech, and costly, mortar shells that can be guided by lasers or GPS have also landed near Congolese army positions, the experts said. They added that these had not previously been observed in the area and that \u201cthe use of the weapon system requires extensive training\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Recently, Rwanda has barely bothered to maintain the pretence that it is not involved in Congo. In response to America\u2019s call for it to withdraw its troops, Rwanda\u2019s foreign ministry hit back saying it has taken measures to protect its air space and to \u201cdegrade offensive air capabilities\u201d (which sounds like code for attacking Goma airport).
