The lessons include a more focused and less cumbersome planning system, less political dithering and interference, and a recognition that we do not have the necessary level of engineering experience and capability in Britain to deliver this kind of mega project. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The central problem, however, is more fundamental. Within government HS2 was primarily seen as a stand-alone transport project rather than as a means to tackle two of the country\u2019s most significant issues: regional inequality and low productivity. HS2 could have produced an agglomeration effect by making it easier, and faster, to travel and do business between our big towns and cities. But that kind of strategic clarity about the wider outcome of HS2 was largely missing. Hence the piecemeal approach we have today. The main lesson, therefore, is the need to be clear about the core purpose that such projects are trying to achieve before they start, in order to build a national consensus that can stand the inevitable ups and downs of implementation.

As evidence, you pointed to events in the spring of 2023, noting that liquidity provided by the FHLB system surpassed $1trn for the first time since the financial crisis, and asserted that the inexpensive nature of the system\u2019s liquidity stands as a barrier to the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to recognise when a financial institution is in trouble (note, the Fed has not made this assertion)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "You did not mention that serving as a reliable liquidity provider in all market environments is precisely the role that Congress has carved out for the FHLB system. However, unlike a central bank, the FHLB is a market-based, self-capitalising, member-owned co-operative designed to expand and contract based on the liquidity needs of its members. In times of market stress, demand for FHLB liquidity naturally increases as financial institutions seek to strengthen their balance sheets to weather the storm. For more than 90 years FHLB members have built relationships with and come to rely upon their FHLB as a first responder in crisis situations. Furthermore, each member undergoes robust credit evaluation and monitoring and the FHLBs are statutorily required to offer advances collateralised only with eligible \u201cmission-based\u201d collateral that support housing and community economic development.
