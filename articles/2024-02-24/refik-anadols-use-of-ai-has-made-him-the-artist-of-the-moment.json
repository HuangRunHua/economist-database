Last year Refik Anadol projected luminous images of coral on to a wall at the World Economic Forum in Davos and covered the exterior screen of the Sphere, a new concert venue in Las Vegas, with animated, tumbling blue blocks. In October the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York acquired \u201cUnsupervised\u2014Machine Hallucinations\u201d, in which a machine-learning model generates artworks based on those in the museum\u2019s collection. On February 16th \u201cEchoes of the Earth\u201d, his largest-ever show in Britain, opened at the Serpentine North Gallery in London."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Anadol, a 38-year-old Turk who lives in Los Angeles, is riding widespread public interest in artificial intelligence to become the most visible digital artist of his generation. His work reflects the innovation and anxieties of the current moment. As Mr Anadol sees it, AI is a powerful creative tool. In a world where so much of life happens in a digital realm, he argues, data has become a new \u201cpigment\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He is steeped in both art and science, having completed several arts degrees and a residency at Google focused on machine learning. Mr Anadol trains AI models on massive troves of data, often publicly available, to create raucously colourful animations that he calls \u201cdreams\u201d or \u201challucinations\u201d. They swirl on superbright screens (creating what he calls \u201cdata paintings\u201d) and wiggle on walls (\u201cdata sculptures\u201d); sometimes the pieces illuminate buildings, as at the Sphere. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One artwork, displayed at the Venice Architecture Biennale, drew on 70 terabytes of brain scans, allowing AI models to imagine the organ\u2019s development. Another piece used an archive of the Los Angeles Philharmonic\u2019s performances to imitate dreaming. A third assimilated more than 138,000 images and pieces of metadata from MoMA\u2019s collection (pertaining to provenance, for instance), along with local weather and data about noise levels. The results are churning clouds and waves, as well as abstractions evocative of Mark Rothko, a celebrated painter."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To undertake work on this scale Mr Anadol employs around 30 people, including architects, designers and engineers, half of whom work in his studio in Los Angeles. Public projects with institutions and companies have boosted his profile, but some private collectors have bought pieces, too. Mr Anadol also mints non-fungible tokens, digital artefacts that sometimes come with physical works."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The animations have proved popular: around 2.4m people came to see an exhibition of his work at MoMA in 2022. Mr Anadol\u2019s style is accessible and often beguiling. Understanding how machine learning works may help you fathom the process behind the \u201cdata paintings\u201d, but it is not essential. (In some installations, a control panel pops up to explain the model, giving the illusion of glancing under the bonnet but mostly evoking the futurism of \u201cThe Matrix\u201d.) You can be swept along by the crashing tides of colour, or watch a rose turn into a lily, without wondering whether you are \u201cgetting it\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Naturally Mr Anadol has critics as well as admirers. Some compare his animations to glorified screensavers and lava lamps, more spectacular than substantial. (Some do look as if they belong at a hotel in Las Vegas or at Burning Man.) Like anything generated by an AI model, Mr Anadol\u2019s animations raise questions about originality and whether such creations simply recycle the work of others. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some worry that he glorifies AI while ignoring its risks, by presenting a rosy (or deep purple or yellow) view of the tech\u2019s potential. Casey Reas, one of Mr Anadol\u2019s former teachers, says many in the art world are prejudiced against digital art, as they once were against photography, but concedes that \u201csometimes Refik\u2019s work can appear to have a utopian view of technology\u201d. The artist has appeared twice at TED and is fluent in the breathless Silicon Valley idiolect of \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d and \u201cinclusivity\u201d."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240224_CUP503.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Wearing all black, in an all-black room in his studio, illuminated only by high-definition screens, Mr Anadol acknowledges that AI is changing everything\u2014and not always for the better.

Eagles morph into owls, which turn into toucans; the overarching point is the connectivity of the natural world.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hans Ulrich Obrist, the Serpentine\u2019s artistic director, says that Mr Anadol \u201cmakes the invisible visible\u201d; he captures the power of technology as he turns AI from an abstraction in the cloud into art before the eyes. Whether that art looks like a dream or a beautiful banality is up to viewers. But like it or not, people will be seeing a lot more of Mr Anadol\u2019s work. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 70}
