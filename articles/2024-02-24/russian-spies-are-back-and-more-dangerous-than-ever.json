But last month Bill Burns, the director of the CIA, could not resist observing that the war in Ukraine had been a boon for his agency. The remark might well have touched a nerve in Russia\u2019s \u201cspecial services\u201d, as the country describes its intelligence agencies. Russian spies bungled preparations for the war and were then expelled from Europe en masse. But new evidence gathered by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a think-tank in London, shows that they are learning from their errors, adjusting their tradecraft and embarking on a new phase of political warfare against the West."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The past few years were awful for Russian spies. In 2020 operatives from the FSB, Russia\u2019s security service, botched the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, the most vocal opposition activist. He mocked them for spreading Novichok on his underwear. Then the FSB gave the Kremlin a rosy view of how the war would go, exaggerating Ukraine\u2019s internal weaknesses. It failed to prevent Western agencies from stealing and publicising Russia\u2019s plans to invade Ukraine. And it was unwilling or unable to halt a brief mutiny by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, last year. The SVR, Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, saw its presence in Europe eviscerated, with some 600 officers expelled from embassies across the continent. Disastrously, at least eight \u201cillegals\u201d\u2014intelligence officers operating without diplomatic cover, often posing as non-Russians\u2014were exposed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The study by RUSI, written by Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, a pair of the organisation\u2019s analysts, and Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former adviser to both Ukraine\u2019s defence minister and foreign intelligence chief, draws on documents \u201cobtained from the Russian special services\u201d and on interviews with \u201crelevant official bodies\u201d\u2014presumably intelligence agencies\u2014in Ukraine and Europe. In late 2022 Russia realised that it needed more honest reporting from its agencies. It put Sergei Kiriyenko, the Kremlin\u2019s deputy chief of staff, in charge of \u201ccommittees of special influence\u201d. These co-ordinate operations against the West and then evaluate them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That personnel change appears to have produced more coherent propaganda campaigns. In Moldova, for instance, a once-scattershot disinformation effort against the country\u2019s bid for European Union membership grew more consistent and focused last year. It tied the accession bid to the president personally, all the while blaming her for Moldova\u2019s economic woes. Campaigns aimed at undermining European support for Ukraine have also picked up. In January German experts published details of bots spreading hundreds of thousands of German-language posts a day from a network of 50,000 accounts over a single month on X (Twitter as was). On February 12th France exposed a large network of Russian sites spreading disinformation in France, Germany and Poland.

In recent years its Unit 29155\u2014which had attempted to assassinate Sergei Skripal, a former GRU officer, in Salisbury, Britain in 2018\u2014saw many of its personnel, activities and facilities exposed by Bellingcat. The investigative group draws on public information and leaked Russian databases for its expos\u00e9s. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The GRU concluded that its personnel were leaving too many digital breadcrumbs, in particular by carrying their mobile phones to and from sensitive sites associated with Russian intelligence. It also realised that the expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in Europe had made it harder to mount operations and control agents abroad\u2014one reason why the invasion of Ukraine went awry."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The result was wholesale reform, which began in 2020 but speeded up after the war began. General Andrei Averyanov, the head of Unit 29155, was, despite his litany of cock-ups, promoted to deputy head of the GRU and established a new \u201cService for Special Activities\u201d. Unit 29155\u2019s personnel\u2014once exemplified by Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga, Mr Skripal\u2019s hapless poisoners, who insisted that they had travelled to Salisbury to see its cathedral\u2019s famous spire\u2014no longer carry their personal or work phones to its facility, using landlines instead. Training is done in a variety of safe houses rather than on site. Whereas half of personnel once came from the Spetsnaz, Russia\u2019s special forces, most new recruits no longer have military experience, making it harder for Western security services to identify them through old photographs or leaked databases. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A separate branch of the Service for Special Activities, Unit 54654, is designed to build a network of illegals operating under what Russia calls \u201cfull legalisation\u201d\u2014the ability to pass muster even under close scrutiny from a foreign spy agency. It recruits contractors through front companies, keeping their names and details out of government records, and embeds its officers in ministries unrelated to defence or in private companies. The GRU has also targeted foreign students studying at Russian universities, paying stipends to students from the Balkans, Africa and elsewhere in the developing world."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For another example of how Russian spies have turned disaster into opportunity, consider the case of the Wagner Group, a series of front companies overseen by Mr Prigozhin. Wagner initially served as a deniable arm of Russian influence, providing muscle and firepower to local autocrats in Syria, Libya and other African countries. In June 2023 Mr Prigozhin, angered by the mismanagement of the war by Russia\u2019s defence minister and army chief, marched on Moscow. The mutiny was halted; two months later Mr Prigozhin was killed when his plane exploded in midair. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s special services quickly divided Mr Prigozhin\u2019s sprawling military-criminal enterprise among themselves. The FSB would keep domestic businesses and the SVR the media arms, such as the troll farms which interfered in America\u2019s presidential election in 2016. The GRU got the foreign military bits, split into a Volunteer Corps for Ukraine and an Expeditionary Corps, managed by General Averyanov, for the rest of the world. The latter missed its target of recruiting 20,000 troops by the end of last year, says RUSI, though its strength is \u201csteadily rising\u201d. There have been hiccups: Mr Prigozhin\u2019s son, who mystifyingly remains alive and at liberty, offered Wagner troops to the Rosgvardia, Russia\u2019s national guard. That prompted a bidding war between the guard and the GRU, according to the RUSI authors."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The net result of this consolidation is a revitalised Russian threat in Africa. Shortly after Mr Prigozhin\u2019s death, General Averyanov visited various African capitals to offer what RUSI describes as a \u201cregime survival package\u201d. In theory the proposals involve the GRU providing local elites with military muscle and propaganda against local rivals. In return Russia would get economic concessions, such as lithium mines and gold refineries, and thus gain leverage over enemies, perhaps including the ability to sever France from uranium mines in Niger (France needs uranium for its nuclear power stations). Mr Prigozhin is dead; his malevolent influence lives on."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240224_IRD002.jpg", "imageWidth": 794.0, "imageHeight": 1077.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russian intelligence, though bruised, is firmly back on its feet after its recent humiliations.

The next month Microsoft said that \u201cCosy Bear\u201d, a group linked to the SVR, had penetrated email accounts belonging to some of the company\u2019s most senior executives.
