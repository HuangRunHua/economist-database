Only in 1996 did he gain the freedom to run and jump in three dimensions, when Nintendo released a powerful new 64-bit console. Most of Mario\u2019s outings since then have been in sprawling 3D worlds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No longer. On October 20th he will return to his 2D roots with the release of \u201cSuper Mario Bros. Wonder\u201d, an old-school, side-scrolling adventure. Sonic the Hedgehog, who underwent his own 3D makeover, also features in a 2D side-scroller game called \u201cSonic Superstars\u201d, released on October 17th."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The retro fashion goes beyond gaming. Hollywood has developed a taste for 2D, too. \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d, an animated film released in June, threw out the 3D style, ubiquitous since Pixar\u2019s \u201cToy Story\u201d (1995), and replaced it with a hand-drawn, hybrid look, dubbed \u201c2.5D\u201d, which mimics classic Spider-Man comic books. \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d, released in May, adopted a similar sketchbook style, inspired by the animators\u2019 doodles from childhood. In a film about teenagers, they reasoned, the artwork should look teenage too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Financial motives are a driver. Realistic 3D games can take years\u2014and huge budgets\u2014to create. The next \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d game, for example, will have been in development for about a decade by its release, probably next year. \u201cSonic Superstars\u201d, by contrast, was dreamed up by developers over Zoom drinks during lockdown and put together in a jiffy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "More 2D productions are in the works. \u201cWish\u201d, an animated feature from Disney due in November, has a flattened look inspired by the illustrated fables on which the film is based. Next January \u201cPrince of Persia\u201d, a 34-year-old game franchise, will get a 2D reboot with \u201cThe Lost Crown\u201d. Sony is already making a follow-up to \u201cAcross the Spider-Verse\u201d, one of the highest-grossing movies of 2023 so far.
