No withering blight had tainted the province\u2019s vital grain stores. There was no looming peril to its vital potash industry. The threat was more mundane: that pupils under 16 can choose their preferred name or pronoun at school, without having to get the consent of their parents."}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to Statistics Canada, just 0.19% of Canadians over the age of 15 identify as transgender. Even fewer, 0.14%, are non-binary. Yet pronouns are becoming a big issue for right-wingers across the country. Doug Ford, the conservative premier of Ontario, has claimed that school boards are indoctrinating children by letting them choose their pronouns without asking their parents. Similarly, earlier this summer Blaine Higgs, the conservative premier of New Brunswick, retroactively changed his province\u2019s education policy to ensure parental consent is mandatory before a student changes their pronoun.

In September Michael Megaw, a judge, decided to delay the legislation as it could cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d.

Some of Canadians\u2019 fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression or religion, can be suspended using the clause. Until recently, it was rarely used, although populists such as Mr Ford have increasingly turned to it for different matters.
