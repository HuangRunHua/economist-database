In addition to pre-production before shooting and the actual filming of the movie, blockbusters often spend 12-18 months in post-production before they are released. Many of next summer\u2019s blockbusters will be nearing the end of this long road to completion over the next six months. So the strikes in Hollywood have in some cases had an impact on films that have long since finished shooting but are still in post-production."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of the post-production time on the biggest films is spent on visual effects (or VFX). The tennis ball on a stick that an actor ran from on set may need to become a fire-breathing dragon. The creature will need to be designed, a digital model constructed, digitally painted and rigged (think strings on a digital marionette). Then, once the dragon is ready, it still must be animated, its fire simulated, and all these elements digitally composed for dozens or hundreds of individual shots in the film. This work is time consuming, highly skilled and costly. The workforce is global, though it tends to cluster where government incentives have brought together studios and highly skilled, well-paid jobs to a city or province.

People should have choices that suit their needs. Cabotegravir, an injectable PrEP, has been found highly effective at preventing HIV. However, manufacturing injectable PrEP is complicated and generic cabotegravir is years away. Access remains very limited. Moreover, most projects planning to offer injectable PrEP do not focus on so-called key populations who are at particularly high risk of HIV, such as sex workers, transgender people and men who have sex with men. Even in sub-Saharan Africa, where girls and young women face substantial HIV risk, about half of new infections are among key populations and their sexual partners. Punitive laws like those criminalising same-sex relations undermine HIV-prevention efforts.

Most of the people mentioned, including the chief executive, are employees. As companies migrate, or at least inch, towards some form of stakeholder capitalism, CEOs would do well to measure the value of employees not merely as productive assets or human capital but as sources of intelligence, reputation and resilience. At every level, employees who are esteemed and rewarded for everything they can offer to their company, as opposed to just being paid for work done, are much less likely to engage in quiet quitting and much more likely to display lasting loyalty to their organisation.
