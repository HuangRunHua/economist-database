They will decide whether to enshrine in their constitution the establishment of a group of First Nation Australians that would advise the legislature on issues that affect them. Anthony Albanese, the prime minister, has billed the referendum as \u201ca once-in-a-generation chance to bring our country together\u201d. Indigenous Australians are overwhelmingly in favour of the measure. Polling commissioned by the \u201cVote Yes\u201d campaign puts their support for the amendment at around 80%. Yet it is unlikely to pass. Just 42% of Australians overall intend to vote for the Voice. Opposition parties are campaigning against it. Some opponents argue that giving special constitutional rights to any group would be divisive. Here are four books and a film that help show why Aboriginal Australians think that such recognition is necessary. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Finding the Heart of the Nation. By Thomas Mayo.

One outcome of those discussions was the \u201cUluru Statement from the Heart\u201d, which included a demand for an indigenous Voice to Parliament. Thomas Mayo was a signatory to that statement. He spent a year and a half carrying the canvas on which the agreement was written around Australia, garnering support for its proposals. This book is a collection of conversations with indigenous Australians he met on his travels. His subjects are politicians, health workers, artists and elders. They speak about their ancestors, their connection to the land and the challenges facing their communities. In a second edition, published in 2022, Mr Mayo, a Torres Strait Islander born in Larrakia country in Darwin, adds a section on the political and legal implications of creating the Voice to Parliament."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Songlines.

Bruce Chatwin, a travel writer from England, made a serious attempt at comprehension in \u201cThe Songlines\u201d, a part-fictional travelogue published in 1987. He follows Arkady, a Russian anthropologist, into rural Australia as he maps \u201csonglines\u201d so that the builders of a railway track will lay it away from places of cultural significance to indigenous Australians. Chatwin writes of songlines, also called Dreamtime or churinga: \u201ceach totemic ancestor, while travelling through the country, was thought to have scattered a trail of words and musical notes along the line of his footprints\u2026as \u2018ways\u2019 of communication between the most far-flung tribes\u201d. Chatwin is an outsider, and his travelogue does not fully explain the nuances of this tradition.But it remains after three decades the most popular account of the multidimensional relationship between indigenous Australians and the land.

Australia \u201chad no poets but it had thirst and rage and dreaming\u201d, writes Evelyn Araluen, a member of the Bundjalung people of eastern Australia. \u201cDropbear\u201d, a collection of essays and poetry, is a corrective. It expresses thirst and rage, as well as grief and love, but it also has plenty of humour. The title refers to a made-up carnivorous koala that \u201cdrops\u201d on unwary perambulators. Ms Araluen mocks the kitsch, like cork hats and vegemite, that have come to represent Australia in the minds of non-Aboriginal people. She writes sardonically of Aboriginal culture \u201cavailable for purchase in a wide range of hand-dyed linens\u201d. Yet polemic is a stronger note than playfulness. In her poem \u201cThe Trope Speaks\u201d Ms Araluen describes a nation with \u201ca ghostly spectre haunting the land\u201d, which is smothered with \u201cfence and field and church\u201d. Through such works she shows how Australians reinforce a national identity that puts settlers at its centre and confines indigenous Australians to the margins.

It happened every week in Australia from 1905 to 1971\u201d. That claim appeared on a poster for \u201cThe Rabbit-Proof Fence\u201d, a film released in 2002. It so angered some Australians that one politician threatened to use federal funds to finance a publicity campaign against it. But the government was guilty as charged. It removed part-Aboriginal children from their families and placed them in institutions. It claimed to be protecting children \u201cat risk\u201d but was in fact attempting to stamp out indigenous culture and languages. Canada and America carried out similar programmes. Perhaps one in ten \u201chalf-caste\u201d Australian children were taken from their families. They are known as the Stolen Generation. The film is adapted from a book by Doris Pilkington Garimara, from Jigalong in Western Australia. Both are based on the story of the author\u2019s mother, Molly Craig, who with two other girls escaped from Moore River Native Settlement to return to their families. They follow a fence along the length of Australia that was built to contain a rabbit infestation. An official whose job is to carry out the policy of forced removal, played by Kenneth Branagh, justifies it thus: \u201cthe bush natives have to be protected against themselves,\u201d he says, \u201cif they would only understand what we are trying to do for them.\u201d This film shows, heartbreakingly, how wrong he was.

Poppy\u2019s granddaughter, August, who returns to Australia from England for his funeral, struggles to come to terms with the upheaval in her hometown, Massacre Plains, provoked by the proposed mine.
