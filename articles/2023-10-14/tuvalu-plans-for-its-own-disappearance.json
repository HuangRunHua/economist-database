Tuvalu\u2019s government warns that its territory could slip underwater by the end of the century. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of disappearing from the surface of this Earth,\u201d Kausea Natano, the prime minister, said in September.

The new wording, which came into effect on October 1st, will not on its own change very much. Under international law, a country must have a physical territory and permanent population. But no one has considered what happens if climate change strips a state of those qualities, says Bal Kama, a lawyer who advised the government on its constitutional changes.
