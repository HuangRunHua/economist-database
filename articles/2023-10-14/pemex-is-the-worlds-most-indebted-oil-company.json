But when, on October 9th, Octavio Romero, head of Pemex, Mexico\u2019s national oil company, appeared before lawmakers, he came close to doing so. Mr Romero confirmed the substance of a letter leaked in September, in which Pemex informed Mexico\u2019s treasury that it was unable to pay over $500m owed to three suppliers, one of which has started a dispute-resolution process. \u201cWe are busy, rather than worried,\u201d Mr Romero claimed, not entirely convincingly. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pemex has been the world\u2019s most indebted oil company for several years. Its debt is over $100bn, equivalent to 8% of Mexico\u2019s GDP. While Pemex\u2019s exploration and production arm is profitable, the company is facing losses elsewhere, particularly from its refining operations. In July Fitch, a credit-rating firm, downgraded Pemex. The company\u2019s debt is a risk to the country, too. Moody\u2019s, another ratings agency, mentioned it as a factor in its decision in 2022 to downgrade Mexico\u2019s rating. The recent affair over the $500m means Pemex will need more financial support from the government. For how much longer can the oil giant rely on bail-outs to stay afloat? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some of Pemex\u2019s problems have a long history. In the 1970s after Cantarell, one of the world\u2019s largest oil fields, was discovered in the Gulf of Mexico, Pemex was the motor of the Mexican economy. But governments viewed it as a cash cow \u201cand milked it to death\u201d, says Jorge Casta\u00f1eda Morales, an analyst. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Successive governments also imposed exorbitantly high taxes on Pemex, limiting its ability to invest. They compelled the company to take decisions that were not always sound from a business perspective. As a result Pemex never properly ventured into gas exploration and has an underdeveloped petrochemicals operation. Carlos Elizondo, a former member of Pemex\u2019s board, describes the relationship between the state and the oil giant as a \u201cmarriage full of problems\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Mexico\u2019s president between 2012 and 2018, tried to make Pemex more independent and profitable, as part of his shake-up of the energy sector. He removed oil subsidies and opened the sector up to private companies. This led to some successes, such as the discovery of new fields. However, during his administration, Pemex\u2019s debt ballooned, from $61bn in 2012 to $106bn in 2018. The company became riddled with corruption. Pemex was embroiled in the Odebrecht scandal, in which a Brazilian construction giant paid millions of dollars in bribes to secure contracts.

He wants to slash the company\u2019s debt, make Mexico self-sufficient in petroleum and increase oil output by 45%. His government has injected over 1.3trn pesos ($73bn) cumulatively into Pemex, with plans to hand it a further 4.6bn pesos in the 2024 budget.

In 2021 oil receipts accounted for just 16% of government revenues. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The country\u2019s ageing oil fields are in decline, including Cantarell. Mexico\u2019s total oil production peaked in 2004 and has fallen by roughly half since then, to just below 2m barrels per day in 2022 (see chart 1).

This was helped by the increasing oil price, which was $100 a barrel on average in 2022, and is $80 a barrel on average this year. But although the fall in oil production has been stemmed, it is far from the 45% increase in oil output that Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador has long aimed for. Production of natural gas has fallen. The president has also drastically limited the number of private-sector competitors, who shared expertise and costs with Pemex."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2022 Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration bought Deer Park, a refinery in Texas. Previously Mexico paid it to process much of its crude. But rather than buying other refineries abroad or improving the capacity of ones at home, the president insisted on building a new one, too. Located in his home state of Tabasco, Dos Bocas has cost at least 18bn pesos since work started on it in 2019. That is more than double the original estimate. \u201cAll in all, government policy has been a failure,\u201d says Mr Elizondo."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pemex is also to blame for its current bloated and indebted state. It has cost-cutting programmes, but in a bid to slim down it has got rid of many of its talented people. The cost of its pensions has soared. It continues to have accidents. In May its refineries operated at less than half their capacity. Meanwhile Pemex is not prepared for the global move to clean energy. Demand for oil during the transition will remain, but it will have to be extracted cheaply and relatively cleanly.

It will fall to the next president to sort out the mess. This will almost certainly be Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate for Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s party. Ms Sheinbaum has not laid out a policy for Pemex. She is the president\u2019s proteg\u00e9e and has cheered his energy policy. But, with a doctorate in environmental engineering, she is more interested in renewable energy than her mentor. Her government will probably have to start by taking on some of Pemex\u2019s debt. The oil company cannot refinance it and the government transfers to Pemex are inefficient because the oil company\u2019s debt is more expensive than the government\u2019s. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Sheinbaum will also need to work out what role Pemex should play in modern Mexico. Pemex has limited room to transform itself, unlike Brazil\u2019s Petrobras and Argentina\u2019s YPF, which have diversified into deep-water production and shale, respectively. The chances are that it does not have the geological luck, nous or government green light to do something similar. Pemex\u2019s proper place is likely to be more modest, involving far less refining and more private partners. \u25a0"}], "id": 33}
