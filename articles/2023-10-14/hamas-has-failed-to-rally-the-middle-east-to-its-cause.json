In Lebanon\u2019s Palestinian refugee camps, visitors report a carnival atmosphere.

The start of Israel\u2019s expected ground operations in Gaza may be a trigger. America, for one, is taking the threat seriously. It has deployed an aircraft-carrier and other warships to waters off Israel. Air-force squadrons in the Middle East are being reinforced. Emergency shipments of weapons are being delivered to Israel. The aim is both to show solidarity with Israel and to deter Iran and its proxies from getting involved. \u201cTo any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word,\u201d said President Joe Biden on October 10th. \u201cDon\u2019t.

But none has done so yet. Hizbullah, a Shia militia-cum-party in Lebanon, and arguably the most powerful foe on Israel\u2019s borders, knows that the war it initiated in 2006 in support of Hamas was hugely destructive to Lebanon. It has thus far refrained from joining in again. With its collapsing economy, Lebanon is in no shape to deal with another calamity. Even a state-within-a-state such as Hizbullah may hesitate to precipitate further damage. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Iran is also keeping its powder dry. The 120,000-150,000 missiles and rockets it has supplied Hizbullah may be intended mainly to deter Israel from bombing Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.

Four months ago Hizbullah conducted a much-hyped military exercise in southern Lebanon in which it practised capturing Israeli towns. That Hamas has now done so \u201cputs them under pressure\u201d, says Hilal Khashan, a Lebanese security expert. For now cross-border strikes seem intended as warnings, rather than the start of a war. The day after Hamas launched its attack, Hizbullah shelled Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms, a contested parcel of borderland where fighting tends to be self-contained. More serious exchanges followed elsewhere, including missile and artillery fire. Hizbullah reported that three of its fighters had been killed. The Israeli army says it has also killed at least two infiltrators. The question is whether these skirmishes will spiral into something bigger.

Last month the kingdom\u2019s crown prince and de facto ruler, Muhammad bin Salman, said a deal with Israel was nearing: \u201cEvery day we get closer.\u201d Israeli ministers had started to visit Saudi Arabia openly.

America is urging Israel and Egypt to open some sort of humanitarian corridor. The details are hazy, but reports suggest that it is advocating a safe way for American citizens and at least some Palestinians to leave Gaza. \u201cCivilians did nothing wrong. We want to make sure they have a way out,\u201d said a White House spokesman. But Egypt does not want an exodus. Its president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, says the Palestinian question should not be settled \u201cat the expense of other parties\u201d.
