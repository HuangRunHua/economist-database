By Adam Sisman. Harper; 208 pages; $27.99. Profile Books; \u00a316.99"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2010 Adam Sisman wrote to John le Carr\u00e9, proposing a biography of the novelist and former spy. Mr Sisman viewed le Carr\u00e9\u2014whose real name was David Cornwell\u2014as \u201cthe definitive writer of the cold-war era\u201d, someone who had captured post-imperial Britain\u2019s disputed place on the global stage in books such as \u201cThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold\u201d and \u201cTinker Tailor Soldier Spy\u201d. Cornwell agreed to lengthy interviews and encouraged Mr Sisman to write \u201cwithout restraints\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At least to begin with. Mr Sisman soon learned that writing a biography of a living subject is a tricky business. During his research, he learned of Cornwell\u2019s umpteen extramarital affairs. He felt that Cornwell\u2019s career as a relentless seducer of women was central to a full understanding of both the man and the writer of great spy novels. (After all, seducing and spying can both involve betrayal.) The novelist based characters on his lovers. He said the affairs were a \u201cnecessary drug for writing\u201d, not \u201cseparate from the \u2018high literary calling\u2019, so to speak, but alas, integral to it, and inseparable.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "All the same, Cornwell implored Mr Sisman to leave out the details of his private life from the book. Only now, three years after the death of the novelist and his wife, Jane, and with the permission of Cornwell\u2019s eldest son, has Mr Sisman published this readable, if prurient, addendum to his biography of 2015. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cornwell is the man of the hour. On October 20th Apple will release \u201cThe Pigeon Tunnel\u201d, a film in which he is interviewed by Errol Morris, a documentary film-maker. The enthralling film covers similar ground to Cornwell\u2019s memoir of the same name. He reflects on the psychological injury inflicted on him by his charismatic conman father and his runaway mother and on his time as an officer in Britain\u2019s intelligence services. Unsurprisingly, Cornwell does not describe himself as a compulsive philanderer. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It may be tempting for admirers of Cornwell\u2019s work to see his sexual exploits as a desperate search for love by a man scarred in childhood by feckless parents. The more prosaic truth, which Cornwell himself recognised, is that he was addicted to the excitement of the chase and the exquisite planning required by assignations, which resembled a spy\u2019s tradecraft."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Inevitably, comparisons will be made with Ian Fleming: both damaged in childhood, both former spooks, both prolific womanisers. A more rounded and less appealing picture of Cornwell\u2014complex, vain, emotionally manipulative\u2014emerges from this uncomfortably voyeuristic book than before. But it does not diminish the literary and moral seriousness of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s greatest novels about the secret world. Fleming, whose goal was to entertain and earn money, never aspired to such heights. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 67}
