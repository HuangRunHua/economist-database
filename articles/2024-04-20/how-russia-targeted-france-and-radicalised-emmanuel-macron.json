Later that day Russia bombed Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, claiming French mercenaries were based there and supplying a list of names that the French army says is fake. Shortly afterwards the French uncovered 193 websites set up to undermine public support for Ukraine in France (as well as in Germany and Poland), run by a Russian firm based in Crimea. Days later S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the French defence minister, said Russian air-traffic controllers had threatened that a French aircraft patrolling over the Black Sea would be shot down. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In recent months France has catalogued an intensified Russian campaign to sow division, discredit the country and test its army. Russian security services, say French sources, commissioned the stars of David stencilled on walls in Paris last October, to stir up inter-religious tensions. In March cyber-attacks briefly took down some of the French government\u2019s websites, and hackers stole data from its jobs agency. With the added help of Russia apologists in France, Russian bot farms turbo-charged scare stories about bed bugs in Paris, used a deepfake French news report to fabricate a supposed attempt on Mr Macron\u2019s life, and spread vile false rumours about his wife, Brigitte."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This systematic targeting, say those close to the president, underlies a shift that continues to puzzle many observers: Mr Macron\u2019s conversion from a leader who sought to engage with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin to one of Europe\u2019s most hawkish voices. The president who once urged allies not to \u201chumiliate\u201d Russia has now called for Russia\u2019s defeat, urged allies not to be \u201ccowardly\u201d, and warned that a Russian victory would spell \u201cthe end of European security\u201d. Mr Macron has not spoken to Mr Putin since September 2022. On February 26th he refused to rule out sending ground forces to help Ukraine."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What explains this shift? At a basic level, says Bruno Tertrais of the Institut Montaigne, a think-tank, Mr Macron was \u201cmugged by reality\u201d. Mr Putin lied to him and played him. The French president\u2019s pre-war diplomatic outreach was a failure, even if he knew it was high-risk at the time. The assassination of Alexei Navalny in February served as a further jolt. As a former minister told Le Monde, Mr Macron was \u201cradicalised by disappointment\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s difficulties on the ground, as well as the prospect of another Donald Trump presidency, have made standing up to Russia more urgent. This comes at a time when Mr Macron has already concluded, in a speech in Bratislava last May, that bringing Ukraine into both the European Union and NATO would actually strengthen his ambition for European collective defence, not dilute it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFor decades France had believed that when it came to Europe, smaller was better,\u201d writes C\u00e9lia Belin of the European Council on Foreign Relations, in the American magazine Foreign Affairs. Russian aggression, she notes, has transformed the case for a wider EU. A French ten-year security commitment to Ukraine is now entrenched in a bilateral agreement, signed by Mr Macron and Volodymyr Zelensky in February. It is worth \u20ac3bn ($3.2bn) in 2024 and includes a French promise to support Ukraine\u2019s entry into NATO."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sceptics still query the sincerity of Mr Macron\u2019s conversion, pointing to French efforts to cap Ukrainian farm exports. Fine words are one thing; concrete action another. Figures from Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute suggest that French bilateral military aid is a fraction of Germany\u2019s, though the latest numbers go up only to mid-January. With a budget deficit in 2023 of 5.5% of GDP, France is strapped for cash, its army has little kit to spare and its industry is struggling to produce stuff much faster. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Others dismiss Mr Macron\u2019s hardline stance as electioneering, intended to distinguish his geopolitics from Marine Le Pen\u2019s, whose National Rally (RN) was once financed by a Russian bank. While this is indeed a campaign theme, its effectiveness is doubtful. The RN looks set to crush his party at polls for the European Parliament in June. The idea of sending ground forces to Ukraine is deeply unpopular in France."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is noteworthy that Mr Macron\u2019s volte-face has won the loudest approval from Europe\u2019s once sceptical eastern fringe. \u201cI do think it\u2019s genuine,\u201d says Nicu Popescu, a former foreign minister of Moldova. \u201cMacron has concluded that the EU\u2019s security depends on the security of its neighbours.\u201d Mr Macron backs Estonia\u2019s idea of joint EU borrowing to pay for arms to Ukraine, an idea that is hated in frugal Germany. French diplomats recently drew up alarming scenarios about the implications of a Russian victory. Mr Macron, says a French military source, no longer harbours any doubts about Moscow\u2019s expansionist ambitions. If Russia wins, the president said last month, Mr Putin will not stop at Ukraine. Now Mr Macron needs to act on his new understanding. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 39}
