With every step, the air thickens with the smell of petrol. Around a corner is the workshop, and the buzz of manufacturing.

The attacks revealed gaps in air defences and vulnerabilities to Russia\u2019s new Kh-69 low-altitude cruise missile. On April 11th such missiles destroyed Ukraine\u2019s Trypilska power station, 40km from Kyiv, though it was in range of the capital\u2019s Patriot air-defence systems.
