By Nick Lloyd. Viking; 672 pages; \u00a330. To be published in America by W.W. Norton in August; $42"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Just 29 years old, Karl I was desperate to lead Austria-Hungary out of the first world war. He was crowned as Habsburg emperor in November 1916 after the death of his great uncle, who had ruled for 68 years. Though the empire had been instrumental in starting the conflict following the assassination of its archduke, Franz Ferdinand, in June 1914 by a militant Serb nationalist, now Karl could see only the nightmarish cost. Austria-Hungary\u2019s increasingly ramshackle, polyglot army had suffered devastating losses at the hands of Aleksei Brusilov, a Russian general, five months earlier. To function it depended on its ally, Germany. Vienna was starving. But secret peace talks went nowhere, and Austria-Hungary was dragged limpingly along in Germany\u2019s wake to disaster."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Karl, ultimately exiled in Madeira, died from pneumonia in 1922. Though unsuccessful, Karl was beatified by the pope 82 years later for his peacemaking efforts. He is one of a small number of sympathetic figures in Nick Lloyd\u2019s superb history of the Eastern Front in the first world war and one of even fewer who had some inkling of how it might end. But apart from the heroism and resilience of the ordinary soldiers, this is a story of vainglory, cynicism, incompetence and callousness."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fascination with the Great War endures. The name has stuck despite the even larger conflict\u2014and death toll\u2014that came later. Though the books devoted to the first world war\u2019s Western Front are extensive, the story of the Eastern Front has been mostly neglected. Mr Lloyd, a professor of modern warfare at King\u2019s College London, has produced the first major history of the Eastern Front in English in nearly 50 years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first world war drew in 32 countries; its Eastern Front stretched over 900 miles \u201cfrom the Baltic to the Alps, from the peaks of the Carpathians to the shores of the Aegean\u201d. Some of the fiercest fighting was in Galicia, a region that includes what is today western Ukraine. It was very different from the war on the Western Front where, other than in its opening and closing stages, the armies of both sides were locked into a highly concentrated, trench-bound stalemate. In the east, there was often the space and terrain for manoeuvre warfare and pitched battles\u2014and even the potential for dramatic, cavalry-led breakthroughs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although more fluid, the Eastern Front was as lethal as its Western counterpart, due to the destructive power of modern artillery and the machine gun. Mr Lloyd estimates that the two doomed empires, Russia and Austria-Hungary, lost upwards of 2.3m and 1.2m men respectively. Some 450,000 Germans were probably killed on the Eastern Front. Because the fighting was less static but also because of simmering ethnic hatreds, many more civilians died or were displaced than in the west. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Winston Churchill wrote about the Eastern Front in his sixth and final volume on the Great War, published in 1931, he described it as both the \u201cgreatest war in history\u201d and the \u201cmost frightful misfortune\u201d to fall upon mankind since the destruction of the Roman Empire. Yet the book was called \u201cThe Unknown War\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some individual episodes are still remembered, such as the Russian loss at Tannenberg early in the war and Brusilov\u2019s offensive, which was Russia\u2019s greatest and bloodiest feat of arms, resulting in nearly 2.5m casualties on both sides in three months. But so much has been forgotten, including the course of the war in the east across multiple theatres of operation and the strategies pursued by both sides. It is all this and more that Mr Lloyd has resurrected in compelling detail. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Unusually for such a vast confrontation of forces, all three major belligerents ended up as losers. Russia collapsed into chaotic revolution in 1917; Austria-Hungary\u2019s stricken empire was formally dissolved in 1919; Germany met with humiliating defeat on the Western Front."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first world war redrew the world map. With conflict raging in the Middle East and Ukraine today, some might find the prospect of turning to a story of gruesome conflict from the past unattractive. But it was such a painfully consequential war that it continues to demand attention. As the German-American historian, Fritz Stern, ruefully observed, the conflict was \u201cthe first calamity of the 20th century, the calamity from which all other calamities sprang\u201d. The calamity of the \u201cunknown\u201d Eastern Front is inseparable from everything that occurred afterwards. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 70}
