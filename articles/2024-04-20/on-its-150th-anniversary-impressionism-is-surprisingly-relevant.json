The painting of a hazy port in Normandy was hung in a show put on by the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors and Engravers Etc that opened on April 15th 1874. Some of the comments about the sketchy style adopted by Monet and some of his fellow \u201crebels\u201d were so acerbic that they sound more like put-downs from social-media trolls than professional art commentary. An \u201cappalling spectacle of human vanity losing its way to the point of dementia\u201d was how another critic in the 1870s described the new style."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Anonymous Society\u2019s show 150 years ago is remembered as the Impressionist movement\u2019s birth; it was then that the painters were called \u201cImpressionist\u201d by Leroy, though the artists would not claim the label themselves for another couple of years. (An impression was a sketch, in the lingo of painters in 1874.) That show is now the subject of another exhibition, \u201cParis 1874: Inventing Impressionism\u201d, which recently opened at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. In September it will travel from Paris to the National Gallery in Washington, DC."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today Impressionist paintings are among the most recognisable, beloved and valuable, so it is easy to forget the shock many people felt when first confronted by them. The startled reaction was as much a result of the subject matter as it was the rough brushwork depicting the fleeting quality of natural light. The artists rejected the focus of traditional painting\u2014classical myths, history and idealised portraits\u2014in favour of scenes of contemporary life, including the theatre and Paris\u2019s boulevards."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Theirs was a democratic and capitalist undertaking: the 31 artists who took part in the Anonymous Society\u2019s show wanted to select which of their works to exhibit and to sell them directly. This was in response to a government-sponsored Salon put on by the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, which screened paintings with a jury and had conservative taste. Only four paintings sold during the Anonymous Society\u2019s exhibition; the company formed to put on the show dissolved within months. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Viewers regarding these paintings from the past can see some parallels with the present. The Impressionists evoked the destruction of the natural world, with a pure environment altered by railroads and smokestacks. They also painted in the shadows of violence and political uncertainty: only a few years after France\u2019s defeat in a war with Prussia and a subsequent insurrection against the government, known as the Paris Commune. The way the artists \u201cdeliberately or maybe unconsciously erased anything having to do with war from the paintings\u201d, focusing instead on \u201chappy scenes of modern life\u201d, is \u201cin itself fascinating and intriguing\u201d, says Anne Robbins, co-curator of the show at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. She posits that this is not unlike how people are anxious to move on from dislocations wrought by covid-19."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Impressionists were also reacting to new technology, which influenced the creation of art, as it does today. They worked outdoors, rather than in studios, thanks to the invention of portable paint in tubes. Their pictures were influenced by another innovation: photography. Some other artists tried to emulate photography\u2019s clarity. But with the Impressionists\u2019 thick, visible brushstrokes, it is \u201calmost as if they were saying, \u2018Look, this is paint. This is not photography,\u2019\u201d says Philip Hook, author of \u201cThe Ultimate Trophy\u201d, a history of Impressionism."}, {"role": "second", "text": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fittingly, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay makes good use of innovative tech to present these works, harnessing virtual reality to imagine what the exhibition in 1874 might have looked like. Visitors can don a headset and go on a startlingly realistic guided tour. You can almost touch the paintings you could have bought back then for 1,000 francs (if only you had!). Many museums have tried to use tech to complement their old-fashioned shows and lure in younger audiences; this is one of the most successful attempts to date. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This exhibition is about the art world in 1874, but it makes you ponder art\u2019s current state. It raises the question of what has happened to the avant-garde today. In going from shocking audiences to gaining broad acceptance, the Impressionists set a \u201ctemplate that has been repeated regularly with every new modernist art movement\u201d, says Mr Hook. In subsequent decades artists played with style, subject matter and form, challenging viewers to consider what exactly art is, from Marcel Duchamp\u2019s urinal to Tracey Emin\u2019s unmade bed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today there is much less revolutionary experimentation. \u201cArtists challenge much less today,\u201d says one art dealer, who finds contemporary architecture more willing to break with norms. \u201cIn a moment when I thought more artists would be reaching out more politically, they seem to be reaching in more conservatively,\u201d agrees Josh Baer, an art adviser and gallerist. Depicting beauty and personal identity are today\u2019s popular artistic preoccupations. \u201cI thought we\u2019d be seeing something a little bit more aggressive,\u201d Mr Baer adds.

The Venice Biennale, which opens on April 20th, will be another pulse-taking. With prizes and pavilions, it is often described as the Olympics of the art world, and it usually captures the zeitgeist. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cforeigners everywhere\u201d and focuses on artists whose identity and sexuality make them outsiders. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many feel the political correctness that has strangled dissent on college campuses has infected the art world, with artists becoming afraid to ruffle feathers and go against consensus. In today\u2019s political climate museums are \u201cterrified\u201d to push the envelope, says Leslie Ramos of the Twentieth, a firm that advises on art and philanthropy: they have to be \u201cwoke but not too woke, interesting but not too scholarly, not too expensive but not too cheap\u201d. Others blame the internet: a premium is now put on creating large, vibrant canvases that look good on social media.

Here the Impressionists also offer a humbling reminder. Of the 31 artists who presented at the Anonymous Society\u2019s show in 1874, fewer than ten are remembered today. A handful are so obscure that the curators could find virtually nothing about them, says Ms Robbins of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay.
