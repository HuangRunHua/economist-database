The first two are predictable: the author and his blade-wielding assailant. The third character turns this chronicle of violence into a surprisingly tender and redemptive story."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Salman was about to speak at a festival in upstate New York when a black-clad man charged the stage. His first thought was: \u201cSo it\u2019s you. Here you are.\u201d It was 33 years since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran had called for his death because of the alleged blasphemy of his novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d. It was more than 20 since he moved to America after years of police protection in Britain. Now the half-expected, still-astonishing assassin was upon him. \u201cI raise my left hand in self-defence. He plunges the knife into it.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "And into his neck, face, abdomen and eye\u201415 wounds in a 27-second frenzy. Violence, he notes, is confounding to its victims: \u201cReality dissolves and is replaced by the incomprehensible.\u201d But he was alert enough to think this was the end. In a book that is both passionate and illusionless, he is clear there was no out-of-body experience: \u201cMy body was dying and it was taking me with it.\u201d He seemed unlikely to survive but was stitched and stapled together. His blinded eye bulged from its socket \u201clike a large soft-boiled egg\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Only after a few weeks did Sir Salman see his disfigured face in the mirror. When he left hospital there were more scares and treatments and nightmares. He dreamed of the blinding of Gloucester in \u201cKing Lear\u201d; he thought of the knife that kills Kafka\u2019s protagonist in \u201cThe Trial\u201d. Among the supporting cast in \u201cKnife\u201d is the knife itself\u2014at once a cold, sharp object and a metaphor for hatred, fanaticism and life\u2019s ruptures."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Intermittently he thinks of the second character, the young Lebanese-American who has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and assault, and who, typically, had barely opened \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d. Omitting his name\u2014he is \u201cMy Assailant\u201d, then \u201cthe A\u201d\u2014Sir Salman wavers over whether he wants to confront him. Instead he makes up a jokey-serious dialogue between them, probing the imaginary suspect about faith, failure and loneliness. \u201cYou aren\u2019t capable of understanding me,\u201d the suspect insists. Standing outside the jail where the real man was awaiting trial, Sir Salman had an urge to dance."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All he wanted was to be a novelist, but the ayatollah and the knife have made him a global champion of free speech. He reaffirms its value here. \u201cWithout art,\u201d he writes, \u201cour ability to think, to see freshly, and to renew our world would wither and die.\u201d He decries the \u201cfalse narratives\u201d of bigots and autocrats and extols openness and debate. \u201cLanguage was my knife,\u201d he avers, \u201cthe tool I would use to remake and reclaim my world.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the principal riposte to the brutality in \u201cKnife\u201d comes from its third main character: Rachel Eliza Griffiths, an American writer and photographer and Sir Salman\u2019s fifth wife. In forensic detail, he recounts the \u201ccoin-toss moments\u201d that led them to meet and fall in love, his giddy infatuation and eventual proposal. All this is more than a gushy ode: it is essential to his underlying themes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One of those is time. His next thought, up on that stage, was: \u201cWhy now?\u201d The knifeman was \u201ca murderous ghost\u201d seeking \u201cto drag me back in time\u201d. The past, he sees, is both inescapable and fixed. He poses lots of questions and what-ifs about the assault, including why he \u201cjust stood there like a pi\u00f1ata\u201d. He nearly pulled out of the talk but needed the fee for an air-conditioning bill. He knows, though, that time allows no do-overs. Nor, because of Eliza, does he ultimately want it to: \u201cWe would not be who we are today without the calamities of our yesterdays.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "His other deep theme is the challenge of living in a bleak world; or, to put it another way, the riddle of human nature. He \u201cexperienced both the worst and best\u201d when onlookers tackled his attacker and saved his life. Above all, however, the counterbalance to evil is the love and devotion of Eliza, with whom Sir Salman salvaged \u201ca wounded happiness\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cKnife\u201d is a love story about being stabbed, a paradox captured in the skewed symmetry between the attack and another central scene. On the night he met Eliza, Sir Salman walked klutzily into a glass door; he lay on the floor, blood streaming down his face, until she ministered to him. He got up then, and, triumphantly, he has risen again now. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:Kate Winslet explores how to be a good autocrat (Mar 19th)Infatuation, kids, adultery: marriage is the theme of the Oscars (Mar 7th)\u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray\u201d points to the future of theatre (Feb 29th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Back Story column got its name."}], "id": 71}
