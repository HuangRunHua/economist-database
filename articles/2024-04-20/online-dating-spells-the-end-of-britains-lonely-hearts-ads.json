In \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d Jane Austen implies that he is a picky paramour, since he likes a beloved to have \u201cfine eyes\u201d, \u201ca thorough knowledge of music\u201d and a mind improved \u201cby extensive reading\u201d. But read actual Georgian \u201clonely heart\u201d advertisements and it is clear that Mr Darcy was pretty lax. Others were much fussier, demanding, among other things, that their beloveds be \u201cnot fat\u201d, have \u201ca good set of Teeth\u201d, and a bosom that is \u201cfull, plump, firm and white\u201d.

This year, for the first time, Tinder is running ads in British cinemas, which tempt viewers to \u201cjust go out and find\u201d someone. Modern Britons have adopted the apps\u2019 turns of phrase (\u201cswipe right\u201d has entered the vernacular); some claim an addiction to them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile, sections of romantic ads that once spread over pages and pages of newspapers and periodicals have withered. Their historical value remains, however.

Perhaps the very first example was published in 1695, in a pleasingly titled pamphlet on \u201cCollections for the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade\u201d. Appropriately near promotions for a stallion and a bed appeared an advert for \u201cA Gentleman about 30 Years of Age\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As Francesca Beauman points out in her book, \u201cShapely Ankle Preferr\u2019d\u201d, the Industrial Revolution spurred things on. For this manufactured not just products on an industrial scale, but loneliness, too. As the 18th and 19th centuries progressed, hundreds of thousands of migrants were arriving each year in London, where many experienced the kind of acute isolation that only crowds can elicit. London, which had 1m inhabitants by 1800, offered numerous potential lovers. But without the filters of family and friends it felt impossible, one novelist wrote, \u201cto find the one eel out of the colossal bag of snakes\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Where connections could not help find suitable matches, advertising stepped in. It offered a way to filter London\u2019s thousands by such criteria as their weight (which, as adverts made clear, should favour plumpness); skin (clear); ankles (shapely was indeed preferr\u2019d) and even opinions (such as, perhaps, on the all-important question of snakes v eels)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Early ads can strike modern minds as unamorous. The romantic movement may have thrived in Britain at the turn of the 19th century, but it seems to have taken quite some time to make its way to Dorset. There, in 1832, a widower placed an advert explaining that he desired a new wife since his last one was dead and he wanted someone \u201cto look after the pigs while I am out at work\u201d. It\u2019s not quite Keats. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In some ways, the history of lonely-hearts ads is evidence of great change in Britain: few today would demand pig-husbandry of their paramour. In another way, very little is different. The bawdiness is familiar: as long ago as the 17th century one \u201cplump, fresh, free and willing widow\u201d was advertising for a nice young workman to (in arguably another amatory first) send her a \u201cpicture of his Tool\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That may have been satire. But people\u2019s preferences are genuinely similar. Georgians wanted men who were tall, rich and educated and women who were young, shapely and intelligent (though not, one warned, \u201ca wit\u201d). Research on modern apps shows that women tend to look for wealth, status and height while men seek out women who are slim, young and educated (but not overly so: \u201cwits\u201d are still unwanted). It is, says Ms Beauman, depressing. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "The codes of Cupid"}, {"role": "body", "text": "As the genre aged, it changed. Victorians specialised in starchy soppiness; racy Edwardian \u201cbachelor girls\u201d merely sought \u201cchums\u201d. It also developed its own language. In a pricing system based on characters, initials were cheaper. By the late 20th century abbreviations such as GSOH (good sense of humour) and WLTM (would like to meet) were commonplace. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The tone changed, too: from blunt requests to self-referential irony. In the London Review of Books (LRB), a worthy literary magazine, advertisers started to brag about their beetroot wine rather than their bodies and say such obliquely brainy things as: \u201cSexually, I\u2019m more of a Switzerland\u201d. Others offered (possibly ironic) confessions: \u201cLikes to be referred to as \u2018Wing Commander\u2019 in the bedroom,\u201d explained M, 41.
