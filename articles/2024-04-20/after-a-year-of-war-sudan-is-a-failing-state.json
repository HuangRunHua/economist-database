On one side were the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan; on the other the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary unit under the command of Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (a Darfuri warlord universally known as Hemedti). Even after fighting exploded in the capital, Khartoum, and quickly spread to Darfur, some observers still imagined it could be contained or that the two sides would grind themselves to a stalemate, and then strike a power-sharing deal.

If there were, at first, two broadly coherent armed blocs under identifiable leadership, now there is a mosaic of competing militias and rebel movements, each with its own interests and agendas. Arms and mercenaries are pouring over the border from Chad, Libya and the Central African Republic, and across the Red Sea (see map). Even fighters from as far afield as Russia and Ukraine have reportedly joined the fray. With neither side having managed to land a decisive blow, both the SAF and the RSF have begun to splinter. \u201cWe are hurtling towards a failed state,\u201d frets Tom Perriello, America\u2019s recently appointed special envoy. \u201cThere is a real risk of a 20- to 25-year setback for the people of Sudan and the wider region.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240420_MAM941.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 738.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "More immediate is the risk of mass starvation. \u201cThe situation is catastrophic,\u201d says Michael Dunford, the head of the UN\u2019s World Food Programme in east Africa. \u201cWhen you look at the sheer size and scale, we\u2019re desperately concerned about where this is headed.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On April 15th donors pledged around $2.1bn to fund humanitarian efforts.

In its \u201cextreme\u201d scenario forecast, up to a million may perish. Because of the war, large parts of Sudan\u2014in particular Darfur\u2014collected almost no harvest in 2023.

Some 70% of health facilities in war-stricken areas are no longer functional, according to Deepmala Mahla of CARE, an aid group. For most of last year refugees arriving in Chad, which borders Darfur, said they were escaping a fearsome campaign of ethnic cleansing unleashed by RSF troops and allied Arab militias against local black Africans.

RSF fighters regularly attack aid lorries and loot warehouses belonging to NGOs. In February the SAF banned aid agencies from delivering supplies via Chad. Since then it has partially relented, but it continues to withhold visas and travel permits for aid workers. Crossing the lines between territory controlled by the SAF and RSF to deliver assistance is \u201ccumbersome and deliberately time-consuming\u201d, notes a UN official. As a result, whole regions have for months been cut off from emergency supplies. \u201cPrevious food crises in Sudan were localised,\u201d argues Alex de Waal, an expert on famines at Tufts University. \u201cNow we are witnessing something we haven\u2019t seen since the 19th century: a nationwide food emergency.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Consider el-Fasher, North Darfur\u2019s capital and the SAF\u2019s last major holdout in the west. Before the war the city was a sanctuary for those escaping violence and hunger elsewhere: tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of civilians had sheltered there since the previous round of ethnic cleansing in Darfur 20 years ago. Yet these days it is a microcosm of the chaos that prevails elsewhere in Sudan. In theory the national army remains in charge, with several thousand troops holed up in barracks in the city centre. But in reality rebels from the local Zaghawa ethnic group provide most of the security, while much of the outskirts is under the control of the RSF and affiliated militias. Crossing from one side of the city to the other means navigating multiple checkpoints, each manned by a different armed group. Though the SAF conducts frequent air strikes on RSF positions, they often end up hitting civilian areas, including those under the army\u2019s control."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With movement in, out and around el-Fasher so costly and dangerous, life inside is growing desperate. \u201cWe are already too late,\u201d says Justine Muzik of Solidarit\u00e9s International, a French humanitarian charity.

Every two hours in Zamzam, a refugee camp on the south-western side, a child dies from lack of food or medical care, says M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, another French charity.

Discreet ceasefire talks are under way in the Egyptian capital, Cairo. A separate process backed by America is also to resume in Saudi Arabia soon.
