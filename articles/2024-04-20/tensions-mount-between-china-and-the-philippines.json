On April 13th a Chinese coastguard vessel blocked a maritime-research vessel and its escort, both belonging to the Philippines. The incident was just 35 nautical miles from the coast of the Philippines and barely inside China\u2019s notorious \u201cnine-dash line\u201d, which it uses to claim territory over its waters. Reports have also emerged of Chinese coastguard vessels firing water cannons at supply boats trying to reach troops on the Sierra Madre, a rusty warship grounded on purpose by the Philippines within its exclusive economic zone. Chinese boats are also swarming around islands occupied by the Philippines and conducting patrols within its waters.

The recent spate of incidents has had more publicity partly because the government of the Philippines now highlights China\u2019s actions as part of a \u201ctransparency initiative\u201d. This policy shift has been driven by President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos who, after being elected in 2022, returned the country to its usual pro-Western stance. By contrast, Rodrigo Duterte, the previous president, appeased China, generally staying silent about its growing aggression in the South China Sea. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even want us to patrol our exclusive economic zone, that\u2019s how far he went,\u201d says Rommel Ong, a retired rear admiral.

Since early 2023 the Philippines\u2019 government has been releasing videos of China\u2019s growing aggression and taking journalists on its patrol ships to witness China\u2019s \u201cgrey-zone\u201d tactics (strategies to harass and intimidate that fall short of an all-out war)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This increased transparency has raised awareness among Filipinos over Chinese aggression.
