Countries at China\u2019s stage of development often shift towards services. Yet China\u2019s leaders have a soft spot for \u201chard\u201d output. Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s ruler, sees manufacturing as a source of both prosperity and security. He covets what officials call a \u201ccomplete\u201d industrial chain that would free China from reliance on foreign powers for vital technological inputs. His latest five-year plan aims to stop the steady decline in manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first quarter was consistent with that goal. Manufacturing output grew by 6.7% compared with a year ago, faster than the overall economy. High-tech manufacturing fared even better. China\u2019s leaders have talked a lot about the need to cultivate \u201cnew quality productive forces\u201d, buzzwords that appeared in the monthly statistical press release for the first time.

The volume of exports grew by 14% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, according to Zhiwei Zhang of Pinpoint Asset Management. Falling prices and a competitive currency have helped. America\u2019s Bureau of Labour Statistics reckons the price of goods from China fell by 2.9% year-on-year in the first quarter. That is the third-steepest drop on record."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China cannot rely on strong exports for long without provoking a protectionist backlash from its trading partners. Olaf Scholz, chancellor of Germany, raised fears about Chinese overcapacity when he met Mr Xi in Beijing on April 16th. Germany used to benefit from China\u2019s economic progress. It sold sophisticated industrial goods to China, even as China\u2019s manufacturers conquered lower-end markets around the world. Now the two countries have become rivals in many industries Germany holds dear, including chemicals, machinery and, of course, cars. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s reliance on markets abroad reflects some enduring weaknesses at home. Retail sales were surprisingly poor in March. Consumer confidence remains low. And the property market\u2019s misery continues. The price of new flats in 70 of China\u2019s biggest cities fell by 2.2% on average in March compared with a year earlier, the steepest drop since 2015, according to Reuters, a news agency. Sales of newly built residential housing fell by over a fifth. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The slump in China\u2019s property market has contributed to falling prices in many related parts of the economy, such as building materials and housing appliances. That has deepened deflation\u2019s grip on the economy. Factory-gate prices have now fallen for 18 months in a row. Consumer price inflation, after a brief uptick during the lunar new year holiday in February, remained near zero in March. Declining prices are a double-edged sword, as Ting Lu of Nomura, a bank, has pointed out. They have increased China\u2019s competitiveness abroad, which is one reason why the country\u2019s exports have been surprisingly strong. But if deflation persists it could erode revenues, making debts harder to bear. It might also force companies to cut wages, which would do nothing to restore household morale or spending."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For all the paranoia of China\u2019s leaders, they seem worryingly complacent about the danger of deflation. Perhaps they view it as a blip, which should not distract them from long-term aims to fortify China against shifts in the global balance of power\u2014what Mr Xi calls \u201cchanges unseen in a century\u201d. Falling prices can, though, turn a passing downturn into a protracted slump. This week\u2019s figures showed that China\u2019s GDP deflator, a broad measure of prices, has fallen for four quarters in a row. That has not happened since 1999. Or to put it in terms Mr Xi might appreciate, it is a change unseen this century. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 58}
