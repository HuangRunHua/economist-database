That is how investors have long considered Citigroup. For over a decade the bank, which was once the largest and most valuable in America, has been a basket case. It trades at half the value it did in 2006, making it the only big American bank to fetch a valuation lower than its peak before the global financial crisis. Pick any measure and Citi is invariably dead last compared with its rivals. The firm has more staff than Bank of America, yet makes only a third of the profit.

The firm became the laughing-stock of Wall Street in 2020 when it accidentally wired $894m to creditors of Revlon, a failing company. That Jane Fraser became the first woman to run a Wall Street bank following the mess attached an asterisk to her appointment. \u201cGlass cliff\u201d is a term used to describe the phenomenon of women being appointed to top jobs at companies in deep crisis."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It seemed as if Ms Fraser was bound to fall from that cliff. Some Citi staff grumbled that she was a consultant, not a real banker, because she spent a decade at McKinsey before joining the firm in 2004. Those who bought shares on her first day in 2021 were choking down annualised returns of -15% by mid-September last year. But a remarkable turnaround now appears under way. On September 13th Ms Fraser announced a restructuring. She later laid out plans to sack 20,000 people by the end of 2026, some 7,000 of whom have already been shown the door. Investors seem to be rediscovering their faith in the firm. Citi\u2019s share price rose by more than 50% between September and March, meaning that Ms Fraser now appears to be on the path to an accolade far more elusive than \u201cfirst woman to do something\u201d.

Citi was going to be \u201ceverything to everyone, everywhere\u201d, recalls Ernesto Torres Cant\u00fa, who has worked at the bank for 22 years and runs its international business. That was its ambition under Sandy Weill, who was a legend on Wall Street. Mr Weill had bought and merged financial institutions to form a \u201cfinancial supermarket\u201d. In 2000 Citi was the largest bank in the world, as measured by its capital base."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Flaws are clear in hindsight. Harmonies between businesses never materialised. Instead, Citi became bloated. Layers of management obscured what was happening\u2014which was, in the mid-2000s, a vast amount of bad mortgage lending. In 2008 Citi required more bail-out money than any other bank. It laid off 75,000 people, a quarter of its workforce. Its share price, which at over $500 in 2007 had valued the firm at $270bn, had fallen to less than a dollar by 2009. After the financial crisis, Citi\u2019s bosses promised to simplify the firm. Assets were sold.

A tangled mess of reporting lines has been replaced by five businesses that report directly to Ms Fraser: markets, which includes debt and stock trading; banking, which houses investment banking; services, which is where Treasury management and securities services are located; wealth management; and the American consumer-bank and credit-card businesses. Citi now details the capital allocated to each of these and their returns, as well as their revenues and profits. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The reorganisation has cut red tape. Before, \u201cif you wanted to get something done with a client, you had to get the approval of the corporate-bank chain, and then you would move to the approval from the geography management and then you had to get the approval from the legal entity, from the CEO of the regional bank,\u201d says Mr Torres Cant\u00fa. It has cut thousands of jobs. And it has also shed light on performance. \u201cWe want these business heads to compete with one another to achieve their return targets,\u201d says Mark Mason, chief financial officer at the firm. \u201cEverything is out in the open now.\u201d What has become clear is that Citi has a crown jewel: its services arm, which uses a sixth of the firm\u2019s capital and has returned 20-25% on that capital over the past year (excluding the fourth quarter of 2023, which included significant restructuring costs). Other business returns are poor or, at best, average."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Get the polish out"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Fraser wants a bigger crown jewel. Because Citi is a global bank, it has an advantage with corporate clients that operate across borders. The bank now hopes to gain smaller mid-market customers.

Citi\u2019s share price has risen by almost twice as much as those of America\u2019s other large banks since September. But will the changes produce the goods? Citi is still under regulatory scrutiny. The firm\u2019s results from the first quarter, released on April 12th, were mediocre; its share price slipped. Just because investors can now see how poorly wealth management and banking are performing does not mean those businesses will improve. And talent is expensive. As the firm sacked thousands, Mr Sieg was paid $11m for his first three months of work."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is nevertheless a sense that Citi is at last changing.

But as regulations changed, many packed up, leaving just local banks as competitors. \u201cYou decide where you want to focus\u2026and build scale,\u201d he says.
