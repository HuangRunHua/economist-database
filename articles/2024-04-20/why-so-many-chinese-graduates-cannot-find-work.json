This year the mood is grim. At a job fair in Wuhan a firm was looking to hire management trainees\u2014but it wanted only elite graduates and offered just 1,000 yuan ($140) per month, claimed a post that went viral on social media. At a fair in Jilin most of the advertised positions required advanced degrees, said a soon-to-be graduate online. \u201cNext time don\u2019t bother inviting us.\u201d Another griped that firms are not hiring.

The unemployment rate for people aged 16 to 24 in cities reached a record high of 21.3% last June. That was perhaps too embarrassing for the government, so it stopped publishing the data series while it rejigged its calculation to exclude young people seeking jobs while studying. (America, Britain and many other countries include such students when calculating their rates.) The new numbers are lower, but still depressing: in March 15.3% of young people in cities were unemployed. That\u2019s nearly three times the overall jobless rate."}], "id": 18}
