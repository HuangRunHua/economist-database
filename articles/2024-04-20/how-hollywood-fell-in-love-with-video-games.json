Critics called the post-apocalyptic adventure a \u201crare gem\u201d and an \u201cabsolute blast\u201d. In its look and feel, the new \u201cFallout\u201d is much like previous releases. The difference is that the latest iteration is not a game at all, but a television series."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Converting pixelated adventures to live-action narratives long defeated scriptwriters in Hollywood, resulting in turkeys like \u201cStreet Fighter\u201d (1994) and \u201cDoom\u201d (2005). The developer of one celebrated game confides that its silver-screen adaptation around a decade ago was the worst movie he had ever seen."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But now studios are reworking games and finding commercial and critical success. Last year \u201cThe Super Mario Bros\u201d was the second-highest-grossing film at the worldwide box office. \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d, a TV show based on a PlayStation game, won a haul of Emmy awards in January. More game adaptations are on the way: IGN, an entertainment website, counts more than 70 games in development for film or TV, including shows based on \u201cTomb Raider\u201d and \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d and films based on \u201cZelda\u201d and \u201cMinecraft\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What explains the enthusiasm for these game-shows? One reason is that Hollywood\u2019s favourite source of creative material, comic books, is getting boring. For two decades the box office has been ruled by superheroes. But more recently each Marvel film has seemed to be less successful and lauded than the last. \u201cThe Marvels\u201d, released in November, was the lowest-grossing so far. Games offer an alternative: \u201cA deep well of franchises, a built-in audience, years of storylines and endless spin-off franchise possibilities,\u201d says Fred Black of Ampere Analysis, a research firm. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The pioneers of the new wave of adaptations have been Amazon Prime Video (which commissioned \u201cFallout\u201d) and Netflix. These streaming companies, relative newcomers to Hollywood, have been on a commissioning binge to attract subscribers. Unlike older rivals such as Disney, which owns Marvel, they have a limited archive of intellectual property. \u201cMost of the comic franchises were already owned, so they needed to find something else,\u201d says Mr Black. Games were that something. Their success with titles like \u201cCastlevania\u201d (2017) and \u201cThe Witcher\u201d (2019) got the attention of Hollywood studios."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Changes in the gaming world have also helped. The game-playing public has ballooned, thanks to smartphones (which put a miniature console in everyone\u2019s pocket) and the covid-19 pandemic (which created millions of new gamers through sheer boredom). Big titles like \u201cMinecraft\u201d are played by more than 100m people each month, guaranteeing a large potential audience for film spin-offs. The broader and ageing pool of gamers makes it easier to get video-game projects greenlit in Hollywood. Previous generations of producers were befuddled by youngsters\u2019 games; today\u2019s moguls grew up playing them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most significant, modern games are better fodder for adaptation than their precursors. Amazon\u2019s \u201cFallout\u201d has a sharp script and a strong cast. But its epic, post-apocalyptic setting, twisting plot and rich back story all come from the game. The PlayStation version of \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d was so cinematic that the opening scenes of Warner\u2019s TV adaptation were barely changed. Its central characters, Joel and Ellie, were already vividly drawn; the TV series borrowed plenty of dialogue from the game. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For all the recent hits, game adaptations are not yet such reliable performers as superheroes. Paramount\u2019s \u201cHalo\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cResident Evil\u201d did not live up to expectations. The biggest hits, says Mr Black, tend to be either so well known that even non-gamers recognise the brand (think \u201cMario\u201d, \u201cSonic\u201d or \u201cAngry Birds\u201d), or so engaging that their digital origin ceases to matter (\u201cThe Last of Us\u201d or \u201cFallout\u201d). The explosive first episode of \u201cFallout\u201d is entitled, \u201cThe End\u201d. For games on screen, it is just the beginning. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 67}
