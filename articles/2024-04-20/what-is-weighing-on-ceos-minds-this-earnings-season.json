When he got out his pen last year and wrote to Larry Fink, boss of BlackRock, he explained to the passive-investing billionaire that he was doing so because he believed they shared a mutual interest: letter-writing. Your columnist went so far as to use a John Donne quote, \u201cletters mingle souls\u201d, to elicit a response. Evidently soul-mingling, whatever its merits in Elizabethan England, is not the done thing in Hudson Yards. Mr Fink agreed to an interview but not, sadly, to an exchange of correspondence. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The personal touch is not quite dead, though. You can see that in Mr Fink\u2019s latest letter to shareholders, as well as those of Warren Buffett, America\u2019s most celebrated investor, and Jamie Dimon, Wall Street\u2019s top banker. Mr Fink, to explain the importance of retirement savings, tells an uplifting story about his late mum and dad. Mr Buffett writes of his sensible (and now very rich) sister, Bertie. Mr Dimon, though hardly heart-on-sleeve, sounds like he carries the cares of the world on his shoulders. The least personal is Amazon\u2019s Andy Jassy, who in a shareholder letter on April 11th came across as an Amazonian to the marrow of his bones. No matter. The day the letter was published his firm\u2019s stockmarket value soared by $30bn to a record high of almost $2trn. That is an ROI\u2014return on ink\u2014of $6m a word. For shareholders, pure poetry."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is more to these letters than self-publicity. They give a sense of how America\u2019s corporate bigwigs see the world. Two letters, from Messrs Dimon and Jassy, are particularly relevant as the country enters the spring earnings season. After three Goldilocks months from January to March, when the stockmarket rallied on hopes of lower inflation, falling interest rates and a soft landing, they are less upbeat than you might expect. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The main pressure on companies in this round of results will be to prove their worth. Buoyed by expectations of lower interest rates, the recent rally has lifted the share prices of the big companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index. The index\u2019s ratio of price to earnings looks high compared with the average of the past five years. Yet inflation has not fallen as fast as hoped\u2014and therefore nor have rates. For the lofty valuations to be justified, in other words, earnings must rise. That should be easy enough for beneficiaries of the artificial-intelligence (AI) boom\u2014Amazon and Microsoft, which provide the computing power; Nvidia, which supplies them with AI chips; and Meta, whose advertising business has been strengthened by AI. It will be harder for less techie firms. Unless they, too, show strong earnings growth, the market\u2019s mood may sour."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When it comes to AI, the big question on earnings calls will be to what extent big tech\u2019s investments in AI infrastructure and services are in fact generating higher revenues. In his letter, Mr Dimon indulges in the hype. AI, he writes, may be as transformational as \u201cthe printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the internet\u201d. But he also makes clear it is still early days. His bank, JPMorgan Chase, appears to be experimenting with \u201cgenerative\u201d AI, the type that has grabbed attention in the past 17 months, rather than deploying it at scale. Mr Jassy describes a three-layer system of building blocks that Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing arm, AWS, is creating to help customers train generative-AI models, feed their data into existing ones and develop AI-related applications. For such services to make real money, however, big firms like JPMorgan Chase must move from experiments to deployment. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Look beyond big tech, propelled by the tailwinds of AI, and bosses\u2019 main concern is the business cycle. In recent weeks expectations of a soft landing have given way to those of a \u201cno landing\u201d: growth and inflation staying higher for longer, keeping long-term interest rates elevated. If those forecasts come true, investors will be asking whether revenues and profits can grow fast enough to offset the drag of higher rates. If not, fears of stagflation, seemingly put to rest last year, may resurface. On this score, Mr Dimon sounds almost prophetic. Consumer spending, and thus the American economy, have remained resilient, he writes, partly thanks to government largesse. But sloshing buckets of public money into clean-energy investments, military spending and so on risks making inflation stickier\u2014and keeping rates higher\u2014than markets expect. Adding to the uncertainty is \u201cone of the most treacherous geopolitical eras\u201d since the second world war."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Days after Mr Dimon\u2019s letter was published, his words came back to haunt him. Fears of a long spell of higher interest rates contributed to a rare slump in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s share price on April 12th, decent first-quarter results notwithstanding. Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East put upward pressure on oil prices, further stoking fears of inflation. Mr Jassy also alluded to economic uncertainty in inflationary times. Though consumers continue to spend, he warns shareholders, they are doing so carefully. To save money, people are trading down whenever they can."}, {"role": "second", "text": "The write stuff "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Dimon and Mr Jassy lead giant companies. The bigger a business, the more it tends to benefit from faster economic growth. The richer it is, the less it fears an interest-rate crunch that could curtail its access to capital. Other large, deep-pocketed firms, such as oil producers and obesity-drug sellers, may reinforce big tech\u2019s and big banks\u2019 hopeful earnings narrative. Smaller, more indebted ones will struggle if their interest costs do not fall. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In business, the worse your balance-sheet, the higher the interest-rate risk. That is true in society at large. As Mr Dimon points out, nearly 40% of Americans do not have $400 in savings to deal with emergency payments such as medical bills or car repairs. His was not a cheerful letter. It was a bleakly powerful one. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Schumpeter, our columnist on global business:Generative AI has a clean-energy problem (Apr 11th)Why Japan Inc is no longer in thrall to America (Apr 2nd)Meet the digital David taking on the Google Goliath (Mar 27th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: If you want to write directly to Schumpeter, email him at schumpeter@economist.com.
