A morning of talks with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, punctuated by a comradely stroll in the garden and ending in a cordial lunch, seemed to have marked a friendly climax to the three-day visit to China by Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But not all is as rosy as spring. For a start, the German home audience was denied a live view of their chancellor\u2019s frolic in Beijing because ZDF, a German public broadcaster, could not get Chinese press accreditation from the host country\u2019s notoriously awkward bureaucrats. But behind that quibble lurked much bigger troubles. Just before the trip to China\u2014his second since he became chancellor in 2021, and one for which he has attracted a fair amount of criticism from within Europe\u2014Mr Scholz told an interviewer that although an American-style \u201cdecoupling\u201d of the German economy from China is a bad idea, \u201cde-risking\u201d would be wise. \u201cIn Germany, the peacemaking effect of economic contacts was certainly overemphasised,\u201d said the former mayor of Hamburg. \u201cNobody has that illusion today.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This may be true for Germany, which learned a lesson after wooing Russia for decades with fat energy contracts, only to see it invade Ukraine. Yet the statement from Mr Xi stressed a contrary message. It said that the intertwining of economies is not a risk but an opportunity, as well as \u201cthe guarantee of a stable relationship\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This difference means a lot to the bosses of 12 big German firms who accompanied Mr Scholz. Many are deeply exposed as investors in China, or face stiffening Chinese competition. A recent report by economists at Allianz, a German insurance giant, suggests that the two countries are moving \u201cfrom complementarity to substitution\u201d, as China begins to replace Germany even in high-value manufacturing. One example: since 2019 German machinery exports to ASEAN countries have fallen by 14%, and Chinese exports of the same goods have risen by 31%. China is pushing Germany aside even in Europe. In some sectors, such as solar panels and basic ingredients for essential pharmaceuticals, it already enjoys a near-monopoly. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "So when Mr Xi argued against protectionism, the response from Mr Scholz is likely to have been as stilted as the Chinese leader\u2019s response to German nagging on such subjects as Ukraine or human rights. The fact is that although both countries would like to insulate their bilateral relationship from the more strident behaviour of their allies (for China that means Russia; for Germany it is America and some of the more hawkish European countries), they both sense that this is not sustainable. Soon enough, China will have to stop pretending that Germany, and indeed Europe, is acting tougher only because of American pressure, and accept that Europeans do indeed have their own reasons to be wary of China. And Germany will have to stop pretending there is much of a difference between \u201cde-risking\u201d and \u201cdecoupling\u201d. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 38}
