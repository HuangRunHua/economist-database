And at LVMH\u2019s annual general meeting on April 18th, after we published this, two of his sons (Alexandre and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric) are poised to join Delphine and Antoine, his eldest offspring from his first marriage, on its board.

The wolf in cashmere, as the billionaire is known thanks to his killer dealmaking instincts, is showing no signs of letting up.

One is for the 49-year-old Delphine, who since 2000 has worked her way up through Dior and Vuitton, to inherit the top job from her father. Another is the enthronement of 31-year-old Alexandre, who did well as boss of Rimowa, a German luggage-maker that he persuaded his father to buy. He is now jazzing up Tiffany\u2019s old-fashioned image through collaborations with superstars such as Beyonc\u00e9, an American pop icon, and Jay-Z, a rapper. The third is a collegial approach in which the five scions run five divisions of the group. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Mr Arnault has made up his mind, he is keeping his decision to himself.
