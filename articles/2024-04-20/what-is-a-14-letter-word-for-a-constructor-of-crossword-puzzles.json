When Anna Shechtman, a cruciverbalist (crossword constructor), introduced this clue to the New York Times crossword puzzle in 2014, readers took notice. \u201cBro\u201d was traditionally clued as \u201csibling for sis\u201d.

Since its appearance in the Sunday edition of the New York World in 1913 (pictured), the crossword has helped define the canon of common knowledge. Though it was invented by Arthur Wynne, an editor, in its early days, women\u2014especially bored housewives\u2014were the primary constructors and solvers. In \u201cThe Riddles of the Sphinx\u201d, Ms Shechtman, who now creates crosswords for the New Yorker, traces the history of the crossword in America through the women who helped create it.

But by the 1940s, the New York Times, which had resisted the crossword craze, introduced the puzzle, partly to offer readers relief from unrelenting news about the second world war. \u201cYou can\u2019t think of your troubles while solving a crossword,\u201d wrote Margaret Farrar, its founding editor. Farrar, who edited the Times crossword until 1969, insisted on decorum. Words and clues too unsavoury for a morning breakfast on Sundays were stricken from the grid. The clue offered for \u201cLSD\u201d, for example, was \u201cBritish currency\u201d instead of \u201cpsychedelic drug\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As more women entered the workforce, the number of them producing puzzles declined. In 1989 Eric Albert, a computer scientist, developed constructing software, which helped designers fill a grid by enabling them to create and manage word lists. The world of crossword creation began to look more like the heavily male tech industry. Ms Shechtman interweaves this history with a memoir of her puzzle-making and eating disorder (reflecting a need for control that she sees in the rigid format of the grid). In constructing, she thinks about cultural representation. Should crosswords push solvers to expand their knowledge or keep them comfortable?
