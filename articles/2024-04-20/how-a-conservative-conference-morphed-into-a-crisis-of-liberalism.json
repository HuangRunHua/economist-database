The blowhard Brexiteer\u2019s return to the Belgian capital on April 16th will have done little to rekindle his passion for the place. As the former MEP addressed several hundred fellow-travellers of the hard right at a conference, Belgian police swooped into the venue with orders to shut the event down. Outnumbered, the coppers ended up beating a discreet retreat, allowing Mr Farage to deliver a few more quips about gravy-train Eurocrats and fake-news media. After some to and fro, the police opted to seal the conference venue instead, leaving the afternoon\u2019s speakers stuck outside and\u2014worse, for attendees including Charlemagne\u2014caterers unable to deliver food. Not to worry: lunch was replaced by a stern lecture from Suella Braverman, Britain\u2019s former home secretary, about the dastardliness of human-rights lawyers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The half-hearted police raid at a reactionary gabfest was the culmination of a discomfiting series of events around the \u201cNational Conservatism\u201d conference on April 16th-17th. At the ninth such jamboree, organised by the Edmund Burke Foundation, an American outfit, the star attraction of this iteration was Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s proudly illiberal prime minister. Unsurprisingly, some speakers held views outside the centrist consensus, albeit ones endorsed by plenty of voters. This l\u00e8se-lib\u00e9ralisme sent local Belgian authorities on a misguided mission to prove the \u201ccancel culture\u201d decried by conservatives is not just a conspiracy. A policy that aims to exclude hard-right parties from coalition governments, known as the cordon sanitaire, metastasised into an ugly variant whereby merely expressing such ideas is beyond the pale."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first sign of trouble came a few days before the event, when its original venue, a posh set of heavily gilded rooms near the EU institutions used by political parties and diplomats for their own shindigs, decided to turf out the conservatives. One of Brussels\u2019s 19 district mayors had ginned up fears of \u201canti-fascist\u201d protests, arguing that security was impossible to arrange. This is clearly nonsense. Brussels hosts dozens of summits featuring grandees that run into no such problems. Nor had policing been an issue when the National Conservative bunch had held a similar event at the same venue in 2022. Discomfiting as that show of censorship was, more was to come. A backup Brussels venue was secured at a cavernous Sofitel near the European Parliament also well used to political confabs. As the conservative organisers were in the midst of setting up their stage on the day before the event, another Brussels district mayor worked to evict them, taking pride in foiling the conference of people whose views he disagrees with.

If the site originally booked was the Ritz of political rallies, this was more akin to a roadside motel, jammed between a second-hand clothes shop and a kebab joint in Belgium\u2019s poorest district; upcoming events include a Shrek-themed rave (\u201cBring out your inner ogre!\u201d).

Among the forces to be combated: the European Parliament, the European Commission, the mainstream media, polite society, the UN, immigrants, political correctness, NGOs, \u201cBolshewokism\u201d, George Soros, and green regulation.

Many well-meaning speakers, notably from America, do not seem to realise their Hungarian patrons (who helped fund the event) are abusers of their conservative ideology, using it as cover to build a patronage system benefiting cronyish insiders. Some, like Mr Zemmour, hold truly reprehensible views. But to be misguided is their business, not that of either the thought police or the Brussels variant. Happily, the ham-fisted censorship proved surmountable. As the first day of the conference closed, Alexander De Croo, the Belgian prime minister, decried attempts to shut it down as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. An overnight court ruling quashed the original order to ban the event. Boosted by the furore around the efforts of his liberal enemies to silence him, Mr Orban got to address his fans, railing against the EU and the very liberal norms that (belatedly) ensured his right to speak."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stuck between the hubbub of police blockading the venue and persecuted conservatives within, your columnist got to chat for a few minutes with the owner of the Claridge.
