But 2084, a plant-based joint in Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories, hopes doing so will help it attract more customers this year. \u201cAll the expats are gone,\u201d says Naz Farah, the owner. \u201cNow a lot of mainland Chinese are coming and they don\u2019t like vegan food.\u201d Across the road a once-popular Western takeaway has already closed. A bustling Chinese restaurant stands in its stead."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The demography of Hong Kong (with a population of 7.5m) is changing as the city tries to reverse a brain drain that has seen around 200,000 workers leave in recent years. In 2023 the government lifted strict pandemic controls and announced a slew of new visa schemes. But this \u201ctrawl for talent\u201d, as the city\u2019s chief executive, John Lee, calls it, has netted a rather homogenous catch. The city granted just 8,000 visas to Westerners between January and November 2023. Ten times as many went to people from mainland China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Westerners appear less interested in Hong Kong as a place to live. Many left because of covid-19. But they also complained of China\u2019s tightening grip on the territory. Those who still desire to move there for work have struggled to find jobs owing to the city\u2019s slow economic recovery and changing language requirements. \u201cEvery job I applied for required Mandarin, especially in law,\u201d says a woman who trained as a lawyer in Britain, but moved to the city to work as a financial analyst. \u201cNow all the business and corporate work is Beijing-focused. Singapore is really the hub for international work in Asia.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "People from the mainland see things differently. To them Hong Kong offers more freedoms and still has an international feel. When his wife became pregnant, Barry He, a trader in Beijing, successfully applied for a Top Talent Pass visa, which aims to entice high earners and graduates of the world\u2019s best universities. \u201cI think this scheme will give me an opportunity to see the international job market,\u201d he says, adding that he hopes his child will also benefit from a better education. Of the 60,000 Top Talent visas approved between January and November last year, 95% went to people from the mainland.

But the latest influx comes from all over the mainland, says Eric Fong of the University of Hong Kong. \u201cIntegration, if it occurs, may take longer than in the past.\u201d Hong Kongers, protective of their distinct identity, are not always the most welcoming bunch. When a group of mainland children was spotted squatting on a train platform last year (as is customary in parts of China), locals poked fun at them on social media."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the environment is changing. Mandarin is increasingly the language of choice in boardrooms and in the street. Yew Chung Yew Wah Education Network, a leading international-school chain, plans to offer the mainland curriculum by 2026. And in more troubling ways Hong Kong is looking more Chinese. A national-security law imposed on the city by the government in Beijing has dismantled local democratic institutions. Some residents think that the authorities are actively trying to replace more liberal residents with mainlanders.

The territory\u2019s appeal is that it is not just another Chinese city. But as the government in Beijing draws it closer, that image is fading.
