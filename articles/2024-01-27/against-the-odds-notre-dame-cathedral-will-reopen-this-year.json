Working on platforms reached by a perilous flight of narrow steps that cling to the soaring spire, they are putting the final touches on a 1,000-piece, solid-oak structure that will soon restore the cathedral\u2019s familiar silhouette.

But five years after the world watched aghast as the gothic cathedral roof was devoured by flames, the project to rebuild Notre Dame is, astonishingly, on schedule. The cathedral doors are due to reopen in December. (Visitors for the Olympics, which Paris will host starting in late July, must wait to glimpse inside.)

Fire engulfed the entire wooden latticework that made up the medieval roof, before melting its lead casing and toppling the spire. The cathedral\u2019s nave, choir and transepts were mostly untouched by flames, thanks to the craftsmanship of the 12th- and 13th-century stonemasons. So were the 8,000-tube great organ and stained-glass windows. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "However, molten lead and charred oak beams crashed through the roof, spreading embers and lead particles. Religious artefacts, paintings and sculptures had to be rescued and cleaned; the organ and 39 stained-glass windows were dismantled and washed. It took two years to stabilise the cathedral\u2019s stone structure."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When a grave-looking President Emmanuel Macron stood outside Notre Dame on the night of the fire, he described it as \u201cthe epicentre of our lives\u201d. The cathedral would be rebuilt, he vowed, within five years. That promise may have sounded \u201ca bit mad\u201d, concedes Philippe Jost, who runs the public body in charge of the reconstruction project. But, he adds, it gave everyone a clear objective. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That the project is on track is also partly due to the commanding style of General Jean-Louis Georgelin, who ran it like a military operation until his death last August. A light management team, freed from bureaucratic excess has helped, too. Gifts from rich French industrialists\u2014the Arnault, Bettencourt and Pinault families\u2014as well as 340,000 smaller individual donations from around the world amounted to \u20ac846m ($921m). Unlike the usual French grands projets, this one is costing the public purse almost nothing."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240127_CUP507.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today the cramped site on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, an island in the River Seine, is a veritable construction village, complete with a canteen, shower block, offices and sculpture-restoration workshop. Last summer the first eight triangular oak trusses, crafted for the new transept roof, arrived by river. Passers-by watched in awe as, one by one, each seven-tonne truss was hoisted by crane from a barge and lowered into place."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The craftsmen working on the project are specialist artisans, drawn from dozens of small firms from around France. Rather than contract the rebuilding to one company, over 140 separate tenders were put out, in order to support traditional craftsmanship. The demands were unusually high: a decision was taken to restore the cathedral to its former splendour while remaining faithful both to its original designs and the construction techniques of the time. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the roof above the medieval nave and choir, 1,200 oak logs were individually selected from forestry plantations in France and hewn by hand into square timber beams. Craftsmen used hand-forged axes, based on late 12th- and early 13th-century models. On the curved apse roof, finished on January 12th, wooden dowel pegs hold the trusses together without a single industrial metal piece. \u201cThe idea was to work with tools that are as close as possible to those used in the Middle Ages in order to give the wood the aspect of the time,\u201d says Valentin Pontarollo, a carpenter from Ateliers Perrault, a firm in western France. One of the joys this brought was that there was often \u201cno machinery noise, just the sound of the axe\u201d, he says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Inside the on-site restoration workshop, sculptors and stonemasons are also working by hand, with chisels and brushes. On the floor stand some of the near-finished new stone chimeras, the grotesque and menacing beasts installed in the 19th century that look down from the cathedral fa\u00e7ade and towers. More than a dozen gargoyles, 80 fleurons, 70 small chimeras and more than 750 crockets (decorative stone hooks) are being entirely rebuilt, as are three cathedral gables. At 96 metres above ground level, a new gilt-covered copper rooster tops the needle of the spire, hoisted into place by a crane in December. It replaces the one that miraculously survived the fire, falling to the ground beneath one of the flying buttresses. (The original is on display at a museum.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Inevitably some modernists decry the project\u2019s conservatism. After the fire, various architects lobbied for an audacious contemporary flourish: a plate-glass spire or roof planted with vegetation. Notre Dame, after all, is an architectural hybrid, the product of different centuries, ransacked during the wars of religion and looted during the revolution. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s spire was added only in the 19th century, not long after Victor Hugo\u2019s novel, \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d, revived respect for what was then an unloved gothic masterpiece. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Today a public debate pits those who contest the authenticity of reconstruction against those who argue that authenticity is guaranteed by respect for the original, with its irregularities as well as its durability. \u201cThis is not a monument like any other, and deserves not being distorted,\u201d says Mr Jost: \u201cWe are restoring a cathedral that is 860 years old so that it can last for at least another 860 years.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Notre Dame\u2019s overseers are trying to strike a balance. The pristine, newly cleaned cathedral may take some visitors by surprise. Inside the nave, where much of the scaffolding has come down, the freshly blond stone of the pillars and vaults, as it would have appeared in medieval times, is breathtaking\u2014and a startling contrast to their previous darkened, partly pitted form. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the cathedral has not rejected modernity altogether. The Archbishop of Paris has chosen two contemporary French designers for the furniture. Guillaume Bardet is making the liturgical furnishings, including the altar, with dark bronze, and Ionna Vautrin the new 1,500 solid-oak congregation seats, which will have slatted backs to suggest openness and light."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The rebuilding of Notre Dame is both a test and a showcase for France: of its ability to meet an ambitious deadline, to satisfy the demanding global gaze of both secularists and spiritualists and to flaunt French craftsmanship. Finishing in time is a matter of \u201cFrench pride\u201d, says Mr Jost. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the artisans, completion will be poignant. Emile-Armand Benoit, an ornamental roofer on the cathedral\u2019s highest point, says that they are working as quickly as possible so that the scaffolding can come down and the city \u201ccan once again see the spire reaching into the sky\u201d. Halfway down, the carpenters contemplate the newly finished roof. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit heartbreaking to leave,\u201d says Mr Pontarollo, \u201cWe\u2019ll never have a project like this again.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 66}
