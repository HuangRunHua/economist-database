In America and Europe we look at the fraught issue of America\u2019s southern border. Since Mr Biden became president over 3.1m border-crossers have been admitted into the United States. At least a further 1.7m have come in undetected or overstayed their visas. Insecure borders weaken support for legal immigration and boost restrictionist parties. Immigration could bring Mr Trump back to the White House. As president he might pull America out of the Refugee Convention of 1951, causing it to collapse. Mr Biden should call the Republicans\u2019 bluff, roll up his sleeves and set out to fix the border. That would be the right thing to do. It would also help his prospects for re-election.

As it spreads, the technology could raise productivity and shrink gaps in human capital faster than many before it. It could help income levels catch up with those in the rich world."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240127_DE_AP.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1684.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Leaders: AI holds tantalising promise for the emerging worldBriefing: Could AI transform life in developing countries?"}], "id": 3}
