But the remake of the film, now out in cinemas, is itself part of the in-crowd: it is one of a spate of films that became a stage musical and is now a musical film.

The book was adapted into a film in 1985 and became a stage musical in 2004. \u201cWicked\u201d, a musical that follows two witches from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d (1939), has been seen by more than 65m theatregoers.

Something like \u201cMean Girls\u201d offered assurance to financial backers, who could count on attracting new viewers as well as people who had seen the original film and musical. But there is more to the trend than financial calculation. As with Disney\u2019s live-action remakes of 20th-century cartoons, retellings offer an opportunity to update a story according to the mores of the moment. When \u201cMean Girls\u201d was first released in 2004, thefacebook.com was just three months old; gossip spread by word of mouth back then, not direct message. In her new version, Ms Fey grapples with Instagram and TikTok. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whether the trend continues depends, of course, on how the current clutch performs at the box office.
