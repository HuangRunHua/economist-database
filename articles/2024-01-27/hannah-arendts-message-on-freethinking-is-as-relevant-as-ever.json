He wrote to her saying that, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he would be most keen to receive a copy of her paper. Such interest says something about the future president\u2019s curiosity\u2014and a lot about the then 68-year-old Arendt\u2019s formidable reputation as a public intellectual. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Arendt was said to be someone you could actually see thinking. Lyndsey Stonebridge, in an absorbing new biography, conjures up the image of Arendt forming her body \u201cinto a single question-mark incarnate\u201d. And the questions she asked were big ones: why did the great evil of the 20th century come about; how could totalitarianism have happened; how can freedom and plurality be protected?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "They are also relevant today, as politics too often threatens to descend again into post-truth madness, even in the democratic West. Might totalitarianism\u2019s horrors return? Exploring the mind of one of the past century\u2019s great thinkers on these matters has, sadly, become a topical enterprise."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Stonebridge, a professor of humanities and human rights at Birmingham University, does an admirable job. She has been reading Arendt for over 30 years, she says, but her approach is not merely bookish. She imagines her way into Arendt\u2019s life, in places literally retracing her subject\u2019s footsteps, sensing the climate and smelling the (typically smoke-filled) air in an effort of understanding. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "She follows Arendt to Hanover, where she was born. She pictures the young Hannah crossing the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) and proudly responding to the boys calling her \u201cJewess!\u201d. She wanders through the university town of Marburg, where as a student Arendt began an affair with her philosophy teacher Martin Heidegger: the combination of Heidegger\u2019s \u201cnarcissism with his Nazism\u201d would drive them apart, Ms Stonebridge writes, though their intellectual friendship resumed after the war. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The author visits the bleak camp in south-west France where Arendt was interned for several weeks (until she escaped); the narrow streets of Montauban, where Arendt ran into the familiar figure of Heinrich Bl\u00fccher, who became her husband; and the \u201cfantastic beauty\u201d of Portbou, near the Spanish border, where Arendt tried to find the grave of her friend Walter Benjamin, a Jewish philosopher who had committed suicide, before she headed on to Lisbon and left the chaos of Europe for a new life in America. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The physical places illuminate the journey of the mind. At the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, for example, Ms Stonebridge marvels, as Arendt did, at its collection of ancient gravestones. The sculptures helped Arendt think the world anew, after being immersed in the gloom of her great work, \u201cThe Origins of Totalitarianism\u201d (a survivor\u2019s narrative that Ms Stonebridge affectionately describes as \u201can act of love disguised as scholarship\u201d). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Arendt\u2019s most testing journey was to Jerusalem, as a dogged observer of the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the main architects of the Nazi genocide of the Jews. In \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem\u201d she stressed \u201cthe banality of evil\u201d, which some interpreted as belittling it. The ensuing backlash (not least among Arendt\u2019s own milieu of New York Jewish intellectuals) was fierce. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To this day, observes Ms Stonebridge, \u201cthe Eichmann affair hangs like a brown cloud\u201d over Arendt\u2019s writing and reputation. Ms Stonebridge is more sympathetic. She reserves her criticism for Arendt\u2019s failure to adequately take on board the racial violence of America\u2019s history. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The core and enduring message, however, is on thinking. In \u201cThe Human Condition\u201d Arendt begins with a simple proposition: \u201cit is nothing more than to think what we are doing.\u201d Thoughtlessness, she concluded towards the end of her life, creates the conditions for evil. \u201cThere are no dangerous thoughts,\u201d she famously wrote. \u201cThinking itself is dangerous.\u201d It is what makes people \u201cfree to change the world\u201d.
