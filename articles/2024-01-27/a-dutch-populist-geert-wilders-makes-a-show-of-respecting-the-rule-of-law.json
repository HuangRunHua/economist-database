But Geert Wilders, whose Party for Freedom (PVV) came first in the Netherlands\u2019 election last November with 24% of the vote, wants it to be seen that way. Mr Wilders, a veteran among Europe\u2019s rising hard-right populists, has a history of bashing Islam, the EU and the courts. He is negotiating to form a coalition with three other parties, who worry about his commitment to the constitution. Mr Wilders now says he wants to be a prime minister \u201cfor all Dutch\u201d regardless of religion. To prove it the PVV on January 8th withdrew three longstanding proposals for unconstitutional laws, including a ban on Muslim religious expression."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was an empty gesture: the laws had no chance of passing. But there are signs that the coalition talks, held in secrecy, are progressing. Mr Wilders is negotiating with the centre-right Liberals (VVD), who have led the country for the past 13 years, and with two upstart parties on the right: the New Social Contract (NSC) and the smaller Farmer-Citizen Movement. The VVD\u2019s leader, Dilan Yesilgoz, has said her party will not join a PVV-led government but could back one in a confidence-and-supply deal. Pieter Omtzigt, who founded the NSC last summer, is a self-proclaimed stickler for the rule of law. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first phase of the negotiations is supposed to establish guarantees that Mr Wilders will respect the constitution. The Netherlands is unlikely to go the way of Hungary or Poland, where hard-right populists took over the courts and crippled democracy. The Dutch judiciary and civil service are strong and independent. With at least four parties needed for a majority, the PVV would surely struggle to make any earth-shaking changes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the country has vulnerabilities. Its courts cannot strike down laws for conflicting with the constitution (curiously, the constitution bars them from doing so). The Council of Europe has called this out, and Mr Omtzigt wants to change it. A big scandal under the previous government over false accusations of child-benefits fraud showed that Dutch bureaucracies can ride roughshod over citizens\u2019 rights, which in populist hands could be scary. Dutch should be wary of \u201cleaning back and arguing that the Netherlands will be different,\u201d says Ronald Tinnevelt, a law professor at the Radboud University in Nijmegen."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One common desire among the four parties is limiting immigration. But this week the VVD split over how to handle refugees. Against Ms Yesilgoz\u2019s wishes, the party\u2019s senators helped to pass a law that forces all municipalities to share the unpopular burden of housing asylum-seekers. The Netherlands\u2019 only reception centre for them is overflowing; getting conservative towns to accept any has proved so hard that it brought down the previous government. The issue pits the VVD\u2019s anti-immigrant wing, which is eager to govern with the PVV, against its centrists, who are not. All of the PVV\u2019s potential allies face such tensions between populism and pragmatism."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile, the country has a caretaker government under Mark Rutte, the outgoing prime minister. Ministers who get better job offers are leaving one by one. On January 24th Mr Wilders posted on X, formerly Twitter, denouncing the VVD for the \u201chorrible law\u201d on asylum housing\u2014not a promising sign of collegiality or respect for the rule of law. Dutch Muslims, too, have their doubts. \u201cYou can\u2019t say one thing for 20 years and then suddenly claim to want something else,\u201d says Mustafa Hamurcu, chairman of the Dutch branch of Milli Gorus, a Turkish Islamic organisation. \u201cThe Muslim community doesn\u2019t believe it.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 38}
