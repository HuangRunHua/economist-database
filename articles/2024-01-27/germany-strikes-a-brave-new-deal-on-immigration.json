The country\u2019s low birth rate and shrinking workforce imply a pressing need to import manpower. Yet much political talk is concerned with how to keep immigrants out. The anti-immigration right is surging in opinion polls. Even otherwise liberal folk are increasingly prone to say that \u201ccertain kinds\u201d of immigrants are alien to the Leitkultur, a fuzzy concept of Germanness. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the past week has seen a turn. Earlier this month German media exposed the proceedings of a recent private conclave of hard-right politicians at a posh hotel near Berlin, where participants discussed expelling millions of aliens. That scandal woke up the left, which has organised a series of big \u201canti-fascist\u201d demonstrations across the country, numbering over a million people during a weekend of protests in scores of towns on January 20th-21st."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile, the governing centre-left coalition has injected some sense into the immigration debate, passing two immigration bills in the Bundestag. The first, pleasing to conservatives, will make it easier to expel asylum-seekers with dubious cases, whose numbers have soared since the end of the pandemic. The second, more significant law will make it easier for legitimate immigrants to gain German nationality.

In some cities the proportion is far higher: 45% of the population of Offenbach, a big satellite of Frankfurt, are foreigners, as well as a third of Munich\u2019s and a quarter of Berlin\u2019s. This number has shot up in the past decade, partly because Germany has failed to naturalise those already there.

Sweden did far better at 10%. The number Germany naturalised rose from 130,000 in 2021 to 168,000 in 2022, the highest in two decades. But the backlog still grew, because of a range of obstacles: restrictions on dual nationality, long residency requirements, tough tests to prove language skills and gainful employment, and a clogged bureaucracy.

Yet nearly half of Germany\u2019s 3m people of Turkish background\u2014easily the largest immigrant group\u2014remain non-citizens. Among the hundreds of thousands of Turkish Gastarbeiter (guest workers) who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s, many assumed they would return to Turkey, so did not apply to become German.

In special cases the wait can now be as short as three. Children who are born in Germany with at least one parent who has lived in Germany for five years will automatically become citizens. Dual citizenship is now generally allowed.
