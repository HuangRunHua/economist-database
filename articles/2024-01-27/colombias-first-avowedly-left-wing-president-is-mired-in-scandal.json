And yet all three appear in the evidence in a criminal case against Nicol\u00e1s Petro, son of Gustavo Petro, Colombia\u2019s first avowedly left-wing president. On January 11th Colombian prosecutors charged Mr Petro junior with illicit enrichment and money laundering. The court rejected his lawyer\u2019s request to scrap the proceedings, and set a trial date for the end of April."}, {"role": "body", "text": "His son\u2019s predicament is part of a constellation of scandals encumbering Mr Petro who, nearly 18 months into office, is facing an uphill battle to win support for his ambitious programme of reforms. As for Colombians, optimism about their leader\u2019s \u201cgovernment of hope\u201d is fading."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Sins of the son"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The case against his son goes like this: according to prosecutors, Mr Petro junior, a former regional deputy, took bribes from notorious figures\u2014including a former drug trafficker and the son of a businessman alleged to have links to paramilitary groups\u2014in return for political favours. The crux of the issue is whether the dirty money helped propel his father to power in 2022. Mr Petro junior admitted he had accepted the funds, but says he kept them for himself. The elder Mr Petro has repeatedly denied any knowledge, which his son corroborates. The trial is likely to drag on. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "All this has sparked a probe into the government\u2019s campaign finances, entangling Mr Petro\u2019s brother and Ricardo Roa, his former campaign manager. Both deny any impropriety. Meanwhile Laura Sarabia, the president\u2019s former chief of staff, was hauled before prosecutors last week in an offbeat case befitting a telenovela. It involves a lie detector, the alleged wiretapping of a nanny, and another bag of cash. Ms Sarabia also maintains her innocence. To top things off, Congress launched impeachment proceedings against Mr Petro in December, to which his son was recently called to testify. The Supreme Court also wants to hear from him, on yet another case about illicit enrichment. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The scandals cast a \u201clooming shadow\u201d over the rest of Mr Petro\u2019s term, says Sergio Guzm\u00e1n of Colombia Risk Analysis, a consultancy in Bogot\u00e1, the capital. Mr Petro\u2019s approval rating hit 33% in December, according to the consultancy\u2019s aggregated polling data. He now lacks the political clout needed to push through reforms. These include expanding the state\u2019s role in health care, pensions and education. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "What happens next depends on what evidence the prosecution presents at his son\u2019s trial. Much also turns on who replaces the outgoing attorney-general, Francisco Barbosa, whose term ends next month. Mr Petro has presented a shortlist of three well-respected women to the Supreme Court. The appointee will oversee the case against Mr Petro junior, as well as others. Legal scrutiny may have compelled the president to offer up a set of nominees pure enough to put him beyond any suspicion of stacking the court in his favour."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Petro\u2019s troubles are not a patch on those of past presidents, however. Prosecutors are still going after former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, for alleged links to paramilitary groups and witness tampering. He maintains his innocence. As long as most of the world continues to criminalise cocaine, the politics of producer countries such as Colombia will remain dirty. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, the saga dents the credibility of a leader who in the past has vociferously criticised the ties between politicians and organised crime. Colombians elected him to put an end to the grubby dealings of the country\u2019s political elite. A whiff of narco-cash in his campaign\u2014proven or not\u2014appears at odds with that goal, and weakens the president. Unless Mr Petro turns things around, his \u201cPacto Hist\u00f3rico\u201d coalition will become just that: consigned to history.\u25a0 "}], "id": 34}
