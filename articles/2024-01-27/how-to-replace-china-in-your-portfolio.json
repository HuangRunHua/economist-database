Others fret about the unprecedented slump in its property market. Many are simply tired of losing money. Rumours that officials are considering steps to stabilise the country\u2019s markets may have brought respite in recent days, but over the past year the CSI 300 index of Chinese shares has fallen by 22% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index by 30%."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As such, optimism about China Inc is an increasingly distant memory. Just five years ago, though, investors clamoured for exposure to the country\u2019s growth miracle and sought diversification from rich-world markets, which often move in sync. Providers of the world\u2019s big stock indices were making adjustments accordingly. Between 2018 and 2020 Chinese stocks listed onshore, known as A-shares, were added to the benchmark emerging-markets index.

In 2022 foreigners owned $1.2trn-worth of stocks, or 5-10% of the total, in mainland China and Hong Kong. One financier describes the challenge of investing in emerging markets while avoiding China as like investing in developed markets while avoiding America. But that is not stopping investors from assessing their options."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some financial firms are eager to help. Jupiter Asset Management, Putnam Investments and Vontobel all launched actively managed \u201cex-China\u201d funds in 2023.

Money has poured into India, South Korea and Taiwan, whose shares together make up over 60% of ex-China emerging-market stocks. These markets received $16bn from foreign investors in the final three months of 2023. Squint and the countries together look a little like China: a fast-growing middle-income country with potential for huge consumption growth (India) and two that are home to advanced industry (Taiwan and South Korea).

Last year foreign investors ploughed \u00a53trn ($20bn) into Japanese equity funds, the most in a decade. For those with broad mandates, different asset classes are an option. Asia-focused funds investing in real assets, including infrastructure, have grown in popularity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet these various alternatives have flaws of their own. Unlike China\u2019s offerings, Indian stocks are expensive. They have higher price-to-earnings ratios than those in other big emerging markets. Although Japan\u2019s stocks look relatively cheap, they make an odd choice for investors seeking rapid income growth. Likewise, Taiwanese and South Korean stocks are included among emerging markets because of the relative illiquidity and inaccessibility of their exchanges, but both economies are mature high-income ones."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Size is a problem, too. Many places benefiting as supply chains move away from China are home to puny public markets. Even after fast growth, India\u2019s total market capitalisation is just $4trn\u2014not even a third of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen combined. When MSCI released its emerging-market index in 1988, Malaysia accounted for a third of its stocks by value. It now represents less than 2%. Brazil, Chile and Mexico together made up another third; today they make up less than 10%.

According to research by UBS Asset Management, Chinese stocks had a correlation of 0.56 with those in the rich world between December 2008 and July 2023 (a score of one suggests the stocks rise and fall in tandem; zero suggests no correlation). By contrast, stocks from emerging markets excluding China had a correlation of 0.84 with rich-world equities."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The emergence and growth of funds that pledge to cut out China will make life easier for investors who wish to avoid the world\u2019s second-largest stockmarket. Without a turnaround in the country\u2019s economic fortunes, or a sustained cooling of tensions between Beijing and Washington, interest in such strategies will grow. They will not, however, evoke the sort of enthusiasm investors once felt about China. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Editor\u2019s note (January 23rd 2024): This article has been updated for market moves."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 56}
