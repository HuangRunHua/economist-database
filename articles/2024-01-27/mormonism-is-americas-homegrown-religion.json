Mormonism\u2019s founder and prophet led his followers through New York, Ohio, Missouri and Illinois. They sought Zion: a place where the faithful could be safe and sovereign. Their ultimate destination, Salt Lake City, became the promised land. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That may sound a little too star-spangled and modern to be properly biblical. But as Benjamin Park, the author of \u201cAmerican Zion\u201d, a new history of Mormonism, argues, that is the point. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as it is officially known, has long defined itself simultaneously as a product\u2014and an opponent\u2014of America. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Park, a historian at Sam Houston State University in Texas and a Mormon himself, traces the faith from its roots in New York in the 1820s to 2022, when TikTokers exposed racist and homophobic attitudes at Brigham Young University (BYU). He argues that Mormonism flourished in the mid-19th century at a time of \u201creligious disruption\u201d. The young country\u2019s individualistic ideals made space for believers, such as Smith, to cultivate their own spiritual visions and seek salvation outside established institutions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Mormonism\u2019s take on Christianity proved too \u201cweird\u201d, even at a moment of religious innovation. The Book of Mormon \u201csacralised American soil\u201d, writes Mr Park, \u201cby making it a Christian land long before European colonisation\u201d. To many this belief, and Smith\u2019s personal revelations, were heretical. But no part of Mormonism was as controversial as polygamy, which was seen as central to eternal salvation. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "By the mid-19th century Mormons had come to believe that America\u2019s promise of religious liberty was a false one. After a mob murdered Smith in Illinois, Mormons sought a new home beyond the reaches of the American government. When Brigham Young succeeded Smith as prophet and decided to build Zion in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah was not yet an American territory. Largely because of the persistence of polygamy, the state would not join the union for nearly 50 years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The history of Mormonism, much like America\u2019s, is one of tepid progress followed by retrenchment. When Mormonism was new, and its members were outcasts, some black believers found a home in the church and women held positions of power in the Relief Society, a church charity. Later, as the church sought acceptance among other American Christians, women and blacks were marginalised. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But church leaders may find it hard to change tack, even if they wanted to. Mr Park argues that the church\u2019s conservatism helped it achieve wider acceptance. Mormons\u2019 devotion to family values aligned them with the religious right. In 2012 they even had one of their own as a Republican standard-bearer: Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and presidential candidate. Christians today see Mormons not as outsiders but as allies in the culture war against liberals and atheists. Not even Donald Trump, a thrice-married reality-TV star, could shake Mormons\u2019 commitment to the Republican Party. In 2020 white Mormons were about as likely to support Mr Trump as white evangelicals. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, Mr Park argues, Mormons\u2019 subsumption into the religious right belies fissures within the faith. Challenges to its white, male hierarchy sprang up during the civil-rights movement, second-wave feminism and protests at BYU in 2022. Gay saints struggle for acceptance within the church. The nation is reckoning with similar questions as the country diversifies. America, and the religion it inspired, remain ever intertwined. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 69}
