The wholesale price of olive oil, at \u20ac9,000 ($9,800) a tonne, has reached an all-time record (the previous peak was $6,200 in 2006).

The cost of sugar and sweets rose by almost 9% in America in 2023, and several confectionery giants have warned that such goods are likely to become still more expensive over the coming year.
