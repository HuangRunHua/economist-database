Pablo Picasso, who died on April 8th 1973 at the age of 91, produced 25,000. Between 1950 and 2021 more than 1,500 notable Picassos were sold at auction in America and Britain, compared with 798 by the next-most-prolific artist, Andy Warhol, according to Sotheby\u2019s Mei Moses, the art-data arm of the auction house. In its recent London sales, Sotheby\u2019s offered a sculpture, an illustrated book, a cubist bronze cast, some gravure prints and several drawings and paintings, all by Picasso. Prices ranged from under \u00a35,000 ($6,200) to more than \u00a318m. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since 1999 prices of Picasso\u2019s works have grown twice as fast as the broader market for 20th-century art. The most expensive Picasso was sold for $180m, reportedly by a Saudi collector to a former prime minister of Qatar. But in the midst of what one commentator calls the \u201cPicassopalooza\u201d around the 50th anniversary of the artist\u2019s death, dealers and auction houses are nervous that the long bull market may be about to turn. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One indication is Picasso\u2019s waning influence on today\u2019s creators. \u201cIt is artists, more than anyone, who propel artists of the past into the future,\u201d says Ben Luke, a critic. Having interviewed dozens of them, young and old, for a podcast, \u201cA Brush With\u2026\u201d, he notes that few cite Picasso as an inspiration. \u201cMarcel Duchamp, yes. Philip Guston, yes. Louise Bourgeois, often,\u201d Mr Luke says. That Picasso no longer features on that list is a \u201cmonumental shift\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another thing that could dampen demand for Picassos is the artist\u2019s abject personal behaviour. He two-timed his wives and sired children with different women at once. He seduced Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, who would become his mistress and his muse, when she was 17. He was 45. In 1932 he painted her dreaming, depicting her left cheek and her eye as an erect penis. In the wake of #MeToo all this is becoming harder to separate from the art. The works of other prominent artists, including Balthus and Salvador Dal\u00ed, have lost value in the eyes of critics and collectors because of how they they acted in private. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dealers and collectors are thus anxiously waiting to see how \u201cCelebration Picasso\u201d, an exhibition which opens at the Brooklyn Museum in June, will be received. It will \u201cengage some of the compelling questions young, diverse museum audiences increasingly raise about the interconnected issue of misogyny, masculinity, creativity and \u2018genius\u2019,\u201d says the museum. One of the exhibition\u2019s curators pulls no punches. Picasso \u201csuffered from the mental illness of misogyny\u201d, said Hannah Gadsby, an Australian comedian and art historian, in a Netflix show. \u201cI hate him,\u201d she confessed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWe will be watching it very carefully,\u201d says Giovanna Bertazzoni, vice-chairman of the 20th- and 21st-century department at Christie\u2019s, another big auction house, of the exhibition. If it is a hit, younger buyers may be put off. With Picasso the artist and Picasso the man falling out of favour, so could his oeuvre. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}]}
