But many more remain in limbo, running up maintenance and harbour fees while they are being investigated. Some of the cost of their upkeep ends up being paid by taxpayers.

There are simply not a lot of potential buyers, and even fewer who might wish to gallivant about in the former property of a Russian oligarch (who might take it rather badly). Given how quickly luxury yachts deteriorate without maintenance, many could end up fetching only knock-down prices."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Frozen yachts have become a potential shipping hazard even in places where the authorities are not enforcing sanctions. The government of Antigua and Barbuda declared in March that it would amend its law to allow it to sell the Alfa Nero, a yacht under American sanctions that has been cluttering up Falmouth Harbour since early 2022. The Alfa Nero allegedly belongs to Andrei Guriev, a Russian billionaire. But the vessel appears abandoned, with fuel, crew and general upkeep going unpaid for. \u25a0"}], "id": 36}
