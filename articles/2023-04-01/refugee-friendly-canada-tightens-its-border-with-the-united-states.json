On the other is a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. \u201cIf you come any further you will be crossing into Canada and you will be arrested,\u201d says the Mountie. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d Mr Jean-Baptiste, an agricultural engineer from Haiti, nods his head and steps forward to be arrested, processed and then admitted into Canada as a refugee. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Jean-Baptiste is one of many asylum-seekers who have crossed Roxham Road, an unofficial border point between Quebec and New York state, in the past year. On March 24th, however, Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, struck a deal with President Joe Biden to curb such crossings. The two leaders amended a \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement, which previously let Canada send back asylum-seekers to the United States only if they crossed at official border points. Now nearly all asylum-seekers crossing the 8,900km (5,525 mile) border can be sent back to the United States, unless they are an unaccompanied child or have relatives in Canada. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last year 40,000 migrants were caught crossing the border\u2014the highest number since 2017, when illegal crossings started to be tracked. Despite the new agreement, Canada\u2019s government remains keen on accepting migrants through legal routes. Mr Trudeau wants the country to welcome 500,000 new permanent residents each year by 2025. That is twice the number admitted on average between 2001 and 2014. It hints at the paradox of Canada: although it has strict immigration laws, it is far more generous than the United States."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It helps that few Canadians are opposed to migrants. Some 85% of those surveyed believe immigration is good for the economy and 69% support current or increased immigration levels. Fully 76% would like to see the country accept more refugees. By contrast, 30 years ago, when half as many immigrants came each year, 70% felt there was too much immigration."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some of this generosity is pragmatic. Around 1m posts are unfilled across the country, about 6% of the total. With an ageing population, things are likely only to get worse. Fifty years ago there were seven workers for every pensioner; by 2035 the ratio is forecast to be 2:1. Already more than 40% of Canadians are 55 or older."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pro-migration sentiment also stems from the fact that a quarter of Canadians today are themselves immigrants. Figures released on March 22nd by Statistics Canada show that the country\u2019s population rose by more than 1m in 2022, or 2.7%, to 39.5m. That is the highest annual population growth rate in 60 years. Nearly all this increase was due to migration."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Partly because of the widespread support for migration, and the fact that several constituencies which determine general elections have large immigrant populations, few opposition politicians have spoken out against Mr Trudeau\u2019s ambitious targets. Quebec is an exception. It is the only province to which the federal government has granted the right to determine how many migrants it admits each year. In 2018 the governing Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec, a conservative party, reduced the province\u2019s immigrant intake from 50,000 to 40,000. Last year Fran\u00e7ois Legault, its premier, equated increased immigration with \u201cextremism and violence\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Legault apologised and has subsequently toned down his language. This is probably because business owners are particularly concerned with the shortage of workers. Quebec\u2019s population is older than elsewhere in the country, says Karl Blackburn, head of the Conseil du patronat, an employers\u2019 group that is calling for higher immigration levels and wants to allow temporary foreign workers to become permanent residents. \u201cThese people aren\u2019t stealing anyone\u2019s job,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are contributing to the growth of Quebec.\u201d As with that province, so too with Canada.\u25a0"}]}
