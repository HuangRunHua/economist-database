But it focuses minds on an extremely important question: what reduces collisions in a big city? Transport for London (TfL), the capital\u2019s road and rail authority, puts its answers into five categories so broad they verge on the insipid: safe speeds, safe vehicles, and so on. But there is real value in the detail. A safety standard for Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs), which harnesses blind-spot cameras and close-proximity sensors, is pioneering. The European Commission has followed it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "TfL has also helpfully identified London\u2019s most lethal places. Half of Britain\u2019s most dangerous roads run through the capital. Research in 2021 found that the A1010, which stretches from Tottenham to Waltham Cross in the north of the city, sees the most accidents per vehicle-miles driven of any in the country. Around three-quarters of collisions that cause death or serious injury happen at junctions; the Holborn gyratory, near the British Museum, has been the site of the most deaths since 2012. Westminster is the most dangerous borough for pedestrians and cyclists: it introduced 20mph speed limits on all its roads in 2021.

Deaths and serious injuries on London\u2019s roads have fallen\u2014by 53% and 40% respectively in 2022 compared with a 2005-09 baseline. But movement is not one-way. Fatalities were record-breakingly low in 2020 and 2021, when lockdowns kept people at home. But in 2022 the death toll rose again. \u201cWe are moving in the right direction\u201d, says Will Norman, London\u2019s walking and cycling commissioner, \u201cbut sometimes we are running to stand still.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bureaucratic obstacles, and a funding crisis for TfL brought about by the pandemic, have impeded work to improve the riskiest spots. Only a few parts of the A1010 have bike lanes with barriers.

Safety is the biggest barrier to people taking up cycling or letting their children walk or cycle. But greener vehicles may be unsafe themselves. E-scooters, suggests Mr Norman, are the latest thing to flummox planners. \u201cOne of those doing 50mph down the A12 is not good for anybody.\u201d\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
