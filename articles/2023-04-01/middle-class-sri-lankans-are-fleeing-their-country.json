The nearly 875,000 passports it issued in 2022 was an all-time high. Most of those outside the nondescript building in Colombo were not looking for a post-pandemic getaway but workers aching to flee shortages, inflation and uncertainty."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Official records suggest that 300,000 of Sri Lanka\u2019s 22m people left for jobs abroad in 2022, most of them low- and semi-skilled workers. From January to March this year, another 73,000 left. And there is evidence that middle-class professionals have now joined the exodus."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Business leaders in many industries say they are bleeding staff, including managers they need to train replacements. Companies are used to churn among those aged 20 to 35\u2014especially in it and other in-demand professions\u2014but now seasoned employees in their 40s and 50s are taking off."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s prolonged crisis gives them many reasons to go. Annual inflation was 50.6% in February. Wages are not remotely keeping up, even as taxes climb. In January, President Ranil Wickremesinghe imposed more hikes to fix what the IMF\u2014which last week approved a long-awaited $2.9bn package for Sri Lanka\u2014called \u201cone of the lowest revenue levels in the world\u201d. At 36%, the highest income-tax rate is still modest. The opposition National People\u2019s Power party may nonetheless be right to predict the tax rises will cause \u201cthe biggest brain drain\u201d in Sri Lankan history."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Foreign recruitment agents are hiring young professionals on social media, says Rajitha Seneviratne, a 37-year-old air-traffic controller mulling an offer from the Middle East. Last month, his union warned that if \u201cfour or five more\u201d of its members left, air-traffic control could break down."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Thousands of young IT workers have also decamped, potentially cramping one of Sri Lanka\u2019s fastest-growing industries. Hundreds of doctors have gone, including 477 from January to August last year. A continuing outflow could cripple rural hospitals. There soon \u201cwon\u2019t be anyone left to serve up a glass of wine in a hotel\u201d, Mr Wickremesinghe is said to have quipped."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the government is actively encouraging the drain, both to lighten the public-sector wage bill and in the hope of increasing remittances, Sri Lanka\u2019s biggest source of foreign currency. The fugitive doctors are availing themselves of a facility for public-sector workers that the government introduced last June: up to five years of unpaid leave provided they remit $100-500 a month if they find work abroad."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The foreign employment minister, Manusha Nanayakkara, is trialling various schemes to push Sri Lankan workers overseas. His office advertises job openings with foreign governments on social media. A WhatsApp group and YouTube channel called \u201cRata Yamu\u201d, or \u201cLet\u2019s Go Abroad\u201d, publicises jobs Sri Lankans can secure through a state-run employment agency."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government is also ramping up training in nursing, care-giving and other professions where Sri Lankans are in demand overseas, especially in Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where over 40% of registered \u00e9migr\u00e9s went last year. New vocational training centres are being opened, some with private-sector support."}, {"role": "body", "text": "These policies seemed to be having their desired effect. Remittances, which slumped last year, have increased over the past four months. Yet there is an obvious danger that, by pushing out its brightest talent, Sri Lanka is depriving itself of the people it needs to rebuild at home."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Nanayakkara admits that skill shortages are already emerging in manufacturing and hospitality. Some private firms have launched modest countermeasures. Several IT companies have introduced, in effect, loyalty bonuses for their employees. A big tea company, Dilmah Ceylon Tea, is covering the recent tax rise for its workers. Even so, says its ceo, Dilhan Fernando, the \u201cuncertainty of not knowing what tomorrow might bring\u201d remains a powerful reason for them to emigrate. \u25a0"}], "id": 14}
