OpenAI\u2019s natural-language system creates recipes, writes computer code and parodies literary styles. Its latest iteration can even describe photographs. It has been hailed as a technological breakthrough on a par with the printing press. But it has not taken long for huge flaws to emerge, too. It sometimes \u201challucinates\u201d non-facts that it pronounces with perfect confidence, insisting on those falsehoods when queried. It also fails basic logic tests."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In other words, ChatGPT is not a general artificial intelligence, an independent thinking machine. It is, in the jargon, a large language model. That means it is very good at predicting what kinds of words tend to follow which others, after being trained on a huge body of text\u2014its developer, OpenAI, does not say exactly from where\u2014and spotting patterns."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Amid the hype, it is easy to forget a minor miracle. ChatGPT has aced a problem that long served as a far-off dream for engineers: generating human-like language. Unlike earlier versions of the system, it can go on doing so for paragraphs on end without descending into incoherence. And this achievement\u2019s dimensions are even greater than they seem at first glance. ChatGPT is not only able to generate remarkably realistic English. It is also able to instantly blurt out text in more than 50 languages\u2014the precise number is apparently unknown to the system itself."}, {"role": "body", "imageURL": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dctcfxw13AQ", "imageWidth": 640.0, "imageHeight": 360.0, "imageDescription": "", "text": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Asked (in Spanish) how many languages it can speak, ChatGPT replies, vaguely, \u201cmore than 50\u201d, explaining that its ability to produce text will depend on how much training data is available for any given language. Then, asked a question in an unannounced switch to Portuguese, it offers up a sketch of your columnist\u2019s biography in that language.

On request, it furnishes a list of 51 languages it can work in, including Esperanto, Kannada and Zulu. It declines to say that it can \u201cspeak\u201d these languages, but rather \u201cgenerates text\u201d in them. This is too humble an answer. Addressed in Catalan\u2014a language not on the list\u2014it replies in that language with a cheerful \u201cYes, I do speak Catalan\u2014what can I help you with?\u201d A few follow-up questions do not trip it up in the slightest, including a query about whether it is merely translating answers first generated in another language into Catalan.

It is too early to say what good the technology will do, but this alone gives one reason to be optimistic.
