She thinks that retirement \u201cat 60 feels right, 64 is too much.\u201d President Emmanuel Macron, Joanna suggested, should come down and try cleaning streets. \u201cI would just like him to understand that the French, Parisians, are tired.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "With 740,000 demonstrators across France, turnout on March 28th was below the level five days earlier. But protests look set to continue. The next national strike has already been scheduled for April 6th. Legislation to raise the pension age may have been pushed through parliament, without a direct vote. But the Constitutional Council still needs to approve the reform. It will also rule on an opposition proposition to hold a referendum on the pension age. Its decision is due on April 14th.

His relationship with Mr Macron, which started well in 2017, has soured. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal,\u201d Mr Berger told The Economist at the protest march this week. \u201cBut for two and a half months there have been millions of people in the street, week after week, and his response has been: no meeting, no phone call, nothing.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The political fallout from this episode looks dark. If Mr Macron were to call fresh elections, nobody would win a majority. His centrist alliance would lose five points, getting just 22% of the first-round vote.
