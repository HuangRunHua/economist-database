It is hardly the kind of language to set the pulse racing\u2014unless you are an employee on the receiving end of it. On March 14th Meta, the tech giant Mr Zuckerberg runs, announced it would fire 10,000 staff\u2014on top of the 11,000 it laid off last November. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meta is not alone. On March 20th Amazon, another tech behemoth, said it would cut a further 9,000 corporate employees, having already sacked 18,000 white-collar types. So far this year American tech firms have announced 118,000 sackings, according to Crunchbase, a data provider, adding to the 140,000 jobs cut last year.

The companies are hearing the market\u2019s message loud and clear. On March 24th the chief operating officer of Salesforce, a business-software firm, hinted that the company would soon add to the 8,000 lay-offs it announced in January.

Because tech companies continued to hire throughout 2022, lay-offs have only just begun to reduce total industry employment (see chart 1).

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Between the depths of the pandemic in the spring of 2020 and peak employment at the start of 2023, the tech sector added around 1m workers.

Many of those same recruiters may now be surplus to requirements. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the specialists are not immune to the efficiency drive. As part of its lay-offs, Meta will restructure its tech functions in April. Releasing talented tech workers back into the wild could be a boon for other sectors wrestling with digital reinvention. For years unsexy industries like industrial goods have struggled to compete with the tech industry for talent. Now they are pouncing. John Deere, an American tractor-maker, has been snapping up fired tech workers to help it make smarter farm machinery. Last year the firm opened an office in Austin, a thriving tech hub in Texas. Carmakers, increasingly focused on software, are also hungry for technologists. So are banks, health insurers and retailers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some of the laid-off techies are helping fuel a new generation of startups.

The new AIs may in time mean even less need for, say, human marketers.
