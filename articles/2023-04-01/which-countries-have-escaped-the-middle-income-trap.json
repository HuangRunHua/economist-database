To help its biggest client avoid this fate, the World Bank published a flagship report ten years ago entitled \u201cChina 2030\u201d. The publication warned of the \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d, a term to describe the phenomenon. \u201cOf 101 middle-income economies in 1960, only 13 became high-income by 2008,\u201d it claimed. This striking statistic was illustrated with a chart similar to the one below. A decade later, how has the picture changed? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Answering the question depends on the definition of middle-income employed. According to the World Bank\u2019s official classifications, a country becomes high-income only when its gdp per person exceeds around $13,200. By that standard, China looks set to escape the middle-income trap in a year or two. But for the purposes of the \u201cChina 2030\u201d chart, the bank adopted a more stringent definition: middle-income countries have a gdp per person, at purchasing-power parity, of between roughly 5% and 43% of America\u2019s.

Malaysia has joined the Asian tigers in the high-income bracket. The Seychelles, an island nation off Africa, has also crossed the threshold.

Seven countries that are now high-income by the \u201cChina 2030\u201d definition did not exist as sovereign nations in 1960, so do not appear on the chart.
