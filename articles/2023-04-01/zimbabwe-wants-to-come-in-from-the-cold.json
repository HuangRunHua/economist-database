On February 23rd Zimbabwe\u2019s government welcomed a group of mostly Western and multilateral creditors to discuss its roughly $17.6bn of external debts. Until these are restructured the country cannot get an IMF loan and will remain largely locked out of international capital markets, as it has been since it began defaulting in 1999. That was the start of a decade of economic madness, invasions of white-owned farms and hyperinflation, complete with paper notes each worth 100trn Zimbabwe dollars. Real GDP per person fell by a half in US-dollar terms; today it is still lower than it was at independence in 1980 (see chart).

Some in the West would like to give the country another chance, partly out of resignation and partly because of shifting geopolitics. But the problem remains Zanu-PF, the ruling party. After an internal coup in 2017 that toppled Robert Mugabe, there were several attempts to offer his successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, a road map to normal relations. Every time, repression or tales of corruption on a massive scale torpedoed the efforts. So long as his regime meddles in the economy and is accused of rigging elections, which are due to be held by August, it will struggle to come in from the cold. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To avoid that, Zimbabwe must show Western governments progress in two areas. The first is the economy. Zimbabwe\u2019s government pretends that it has an orthodox approach to macroeconomics. Official figures suggest a narrow fiscal deficit. It has its own currency, the Zimbabwe dollar. Like any central bank, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe uses a benchmark interest rate to tame inflation. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The reality is more eccentric: call it Zimbonomics. The country\u2019s debts are larger than they seem. The IMF last year estimated that \u201cunfunded liabilities\u201d amounted to $5.75bn, including $3.25bn in compensation owed to white farmers. Then there is what technocrats call the bank\u2019s \u201cquasi-fiscal operations\u201d: in plainer language, printing money. This is used to subsidise farmers and miners or to buy American dollars to keep up payments on the few foreign loans still being serviced. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most worrying is the interference in currency markets. Rather than leaving the value of the Zimbabwe dollar to the whims of the market, the central bank confiscates a portion of exporters\u2019 hard-currency revenues, then auctions greenbacks to a select group of buyers at a cut-price rate. The de facto subsidy is worth the equivalent of 2.5% to 5.25% of GDP a year. As well as depleting trust in the local currency\u2014and keeping annualised inflation at more than 200%\u2014Zimbonomics creates arbitrage opportunities for a lucky few."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Airing dirty laundry"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such shenanigans reinforce the idea that well-connected elites and ordinary people play by different rules.

And in March the central bank threatened to sue Al-Jazeera, a Qatar-based network, over a documentary about gold-smuggling. The bank said in a statement that the film falsely created the impression that it was \u201cSouthern Africa\u2019s laundromat\u2026for an alleged African gold mafia involved in illicit gold dealings, corruption and money-laundering\u201d.

Under the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act, legislation first passed in 2001 and renewed by Congress in 2018, American support for financial assistance by multilaterals such as the World Bank depends on, among other things, evidence that the government is serious about the rule of law.

The notionally independent election commission refuses to hand over an electronic file of the voters\u2019 roll and charges $187,000 for a hard copy.

Independent judges are hounded. \u201cThe judiciary is worse than it has ever been,\u201d says Beatrice Mtetwa, a human-rights lawyer.

Even South Africa, whose ruling African National Congress has long propped up its fellow liberation party, may one day rethink its indulgence of Zanu-PF, if only for cynical reasons. It is losing votes to opposition parties that want it to send back the possibly millions of Zimbabweans who have fled penury and persecution at home.
