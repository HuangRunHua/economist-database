At home, the thoughts of some Chinese nationalists were focused on another Russian city\u2014one famous for its sea cucumbers, a popular Chinese delicacy. In China, the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok has been known traditionally as Haishenwai, meaning \u201csea-cucumber bay\u201d.

It repeated an edict of 2003 requiring that maps in Chinese featuring any of eight listed Russian places must show their historical Chinese names in brackets after their names in Russian. The places, most of them cities, are in former Chinese territory. One is Vladivostok, the biggest Russian port in that region.

An academic in Beijing with some 5,000 Baijiahao followers suggested Russia was right to be anxious about China taking back the territory\u2014at least if China\u2019s giant neighbour \u201cfalls into chaos\u201d.

Since 2021 its English edition has often used the Chinese word for the region, Xizang (see chart). Some Chinese diplomats have adopted it, too. China Media Project, a research group in Hong Kong, says this may have begun in 2021, when a statement about a meeting of then foreign minister, Wang Yi, and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, noted that \u201cRussia firmly supports China\u2019s positions on issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Xizang and human rights.\u201d In that list, the anglicised Cantonese name Hong Kong (\u201cfragrant harbour\u201d) is a colonial-era anomaly. Perhaps Hong Kongers should prepare for a rebranding as Xianggang, as the Mandarin pronunciation of the name is transliterated. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}]}
