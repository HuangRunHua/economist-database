First, you tell us that plenty of people \u201cin Britain\u2019s former colonies have long regarded the British Empire as racist and exploitative, even genocidal\u201d. Sure, but the subjects of British rule didn\u2019t all think the same thing.

Of course, my prime exhibit is the fact that Britain was among the first states in the world\u2019s history to abolish the trade and slavery itself. You then emphasise the role of slave rebellions in bringing about abolition. I acknowledge that on page 56. But until you can present a cogent argument that the humanitarian revolution in British mores, which gathered steam decades before the 1791 slave-revolt in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), did not play a leading role in securing abolitionist victories in Britain\u2019s Parliament in 1807 and 1833, my case stands. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Correctly, you point out that \u201cin some analyses\u201d Britain\u2019s subsequent investment in suppressing slavery worldwide was intended to stop slaveholding economies undercutting British exporters, now reliant on free labour.

That concludes that the British Empire wasn\u2019t \u201cessentially\u201d racist and murderous and that it contained growing humanitarian and liberal elements, which found climactic expression when, between May 1940 and June 1941, the empire stood alone (with Greece) as the only military opposition to the massively murderous racist regime in Nazi Berlin."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nigel BiggarOxford"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230304_LDP001.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "second", "text": "Paying people to plant trees"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The notion of paying the owners of rainforests not to destroy them (\u201cCash for climate services\u201d, March 4th) brought to mind the late, great Wangari Maathai, a Kenyan environmentalist. It was while visiting some of Kenya\u2019s poorest areas that Maathai saw how environmental degradation had affected the lives of rural women. In 1977 she founded the Green Belt Movement. Women were brought together to plant seeds, store rainwater, reduce soil erosion and provide food. For each tree planted, they would earn a small allowance. By 2004, the year Maathai became the first African woman to win the Nobel peace prize, the movement had planted more than 30m trees. It shows that empowering a community can achieve a lot.

The island has rushed headlong towards adopting natural gas to power its electricity grid, spurning coal and nuclear power. For all its economic advantages, natural gas presents grave risks to Taiwan because of the country\u2019s precarious geopolitical status. All of its natural-gas supply is carried by tankers that dock at two terminals on its exposed west coast. A third terminal is due to be completed by 2025. A fourth location is under discussion; fulfilling Taiwan\u2019s electricity-generation needs would require that fourth terminal, and possibly a fifth."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Natural gas is dependent on just-in-time delivery, exacerbating the island\u2019s vulnerability to a blockade that many military experts now consider to be China\u2019s most probable method to subdue Taiwan.

Some historical background may explain this equivocal attitude. The people of Taiwan have been forced to identify with different nationalities over the past two centuries. As a colony of Japan from 1895 to 1945 the Taiwanese were coerced into identifying as Japanese. Then came the Chinese nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek, who, defeated by the Chinese Communists, ruled Taiwan under martial law for nearly four decades. During this time the Taiwanese had to learn a new language, Mandarin, and identify as Chinese. Only after the lifting of martial law in 1987 did the idea of a Taiwanese identity start to circulate, and it took time to be adopted.
