Progress is so rapid, in fact, that on March 29th an open letter signed by more than 1,000 tech luminaries called for a six-month pause in work on models more advanced than GPT-4. Whether or not such a moratorium is put in place, big tech is taking no chances. All five giants claim to be laser-focused on AI. What that means for each in practice differs. But two things are already clear. The race for AI is heating up. And even before a winner emerges, the contest is changing the way that big tech deploys the technology.

These analyse content on the internet and, in response to a request from a user, predict the next word, brushstroke or note in a sentence, image or tune. Many technologists believe they mark a \u201cplatform shift\u201d. AI will, on this view, become a layer of technology on top of which all manner of software can be built.

In 2022, amid a tech-led stockmarket rout, the big five poured $223bn into research and development (R&amp;D), up from $109bn in 2019 (see chart 1).

According to data from PitchBook, a research firm, around a fifth of the companies\u2019 combined acquisitions and investments since 2019 involved AI firms\u2014considerably more than the share targeting cryptocurrencies, blockchains and other decentralised \u201cWeb3\u201d endeavours (2%), or the virtual-reality metaverse (6%), two other recent tech fads.

It is more than six times that of Meta, and infinitely more than Apple, which has made no such investments. Microsoft\u2019s biggest bet is on OpenAI, whose technology lies behind the giant\u2019s new productivity features and powers a souped-up version of its Bing search engine. The $11bn that Microsoft has reportedly put into OpenAI would, at the startup\u2019s latest rumoured valuation of $29bn, give the software giant a stake of 38%. Microsoft\u2019s other notable investments include D-Matrix, a firm that makes AI technology for data centres, and Noble.AI, which uses algorithms to streamline lab work and other R&amp;D projects.
