Under New start, which came into force in 2011 and which includes caps on long-range nuclear weapons, there were 2,000-odd such notifications in 2022. No longer. The half-yearly updates on warhead numbers have stopped, too. And there have been no on-site inspections since March 2020. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For now, Russia and America still abide by the treaty\u2019s confines on warhead numbers.

They brought down the global nuclear stockpile from 70,400 warheads in 1986 to 12,500 today (see chart). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That era is ending, for four main reasons: America\u2019s abandonment of agreements, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China\u2019s nuclear build-up and disruptive technology. Begin with America. In 2002 President George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (which limited anti-missile defences), pointing to the dangers from North Korea and Iran. And in 2019 another Republican president, Donald Trump, pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (which eliminated that category of missiles), citing cheating by Russia and China\u2019s rise. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Democratic presidents have been keener on arms control. New start was negotiated by Barack Obama and then renewed for five years by Joe Biden in 2021. It limits each side\u2019s \u201cstrategic\u201d nuclear weapons (long-distance arms with high destructive power) to 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), bombers and submarine-launched ballistic missiles."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But New start does not control \u201cnon-strategic\u201d or \u201ctactical\u201d weapons, usually smaller ones for battlefield use. Russia is thought to have 1,800 of them and America just 200. Nor does it capture Russia\u2019s work on things such as nuclear-propelled cruise missiles and torpedoes. In turn, Russia complains that the nuclear arsenals of Britain and France, American allies with more than 200 warheads each, are excluded. New start is set to expire in February 2026, and there is little prospect of a follow-on deal. In less than three years, the last major restraint on the world\u2019s nuclear stockpile may well be removed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For that blame Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and its repeated threats to use nuclear weapons. Western countries have armed Ukraine, but have not sent their own troops, in part for fear of \u201cworld war three\u201d. In February Russia said it would \u201csuspend\u201d New start, halting notifications. America responded in kind in March and June. Each side has since become ever less certain about the other\u2019s posture, magnifying the risk of nuclear brinkmanship\u2014especially at a time when the Kremlin is at war. Poland says Russia has started moving tactical weapons to Belarus. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then there is China, which is already racing to build up its nuclear force. Unconstrained by treaties, it has long observed a \u201cminimal deterrence\u201d policy with a few hundred warheads. But the Pentagon estimates its stockpile will grow to perhaps 1,500 by 2035. That is close to New start\u2019s deployed limit."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nuclear tensions could spread further and unpredictably. India, which has an unresolved border dispute with China, may feel compelled to increase its stockpile, currently estimated at more than 160 warheads. That in turn may prompt Pakistan, with a similar number, to build up. North Korea, with perhaps 30 warheads, is intensively testing ICBMs. And Iran has become a threshold nuclear state."}, {"role": "body", "text": "New technologies could aggravate matters. Hypersonic missiles are harder to detect and shoot down than ballistic ones. Improvements in sensors and accuracy heighten worries about a disabling surprise attack. And the spread of artificial intelligence (aI) raises questions of how far nuclear war might be fought by computers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In response, America has been flashing its nuclear sabre, if not quite rattling it. Its ballistic-missile submarines, which usually lurk unseen for months-long patrols, have been surfacing around the world of late. In July the USS Kentucky moored in the South Korean port of Busan, and the USS Tennessee called at Faslane in Scotland. In May naval commanders from Japan and South Korea embarked the USS Maine off Guam. Last October the USS West Virginia popped up in the Arabian Sea, in an apparent signal to Iran, for a visit by the head of America\u2019s Central Command."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The \u201csilent service\u201d is no longer silent. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a credible deterrent without communicating your capabilities,\u201d Rear Admiral Jeffrey Jablon, commander of America\u2019s submarine force in the Indo-Pacific, told Breaking Defense. \u201cIf the adversary doesn\u2019t know anything about that specific deterrent, it\u2019s not a deterrent.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "America wants to reassure allies that its \u201cextended deterrence\u201d\u2014the promise to defend them from nuclear attack even if they eschew nuclear weapons\u2014remains strong.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "America is busy modernising all three legs of its nuclear \u201ctriad\u201d with new ground, air and sea systems. An unspoken aim is to rev up the nuclear industrial base to be able to produce more weapons in future, should they be needed. Some want to go further. A paper in March by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, a government-funded institute that among other things designs nuclear warheads, said America\u2019s current nuclear force is \u201conly marginally sufficient\u201d. America should expand it when New start expires by \u201cexpeditious uploading\u201d, deploying weapons currently held in reserve, for instance as multiple warheads on icbms; before then, it should demonstrate the ability to do so."}, {"role": "body", "text": "America has a greater \u201cupload capacity\u201d than Russia. The Federation of American Scientists, which campaigns to minimise global risks, calculates that from the current total of about 1,670 deployed strategic warheads each (it uses different counting rules from those for New Start), America could within a couple of years deploy 3,570 compared with 2,629 for Russia. Some experts worry that big powers might also resume testing nuclear weapons, an idea discussed in the Trump years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Talking of an \u201cinflection point\u201d in the nuclear balance, Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden\u2019s national security adviser, declared in June that America was ready to discuss arms control with Russia and China \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d. Neither is rushing to take up his offer. Given its heavy losses in Ukraine, Russia is either too aggrieved or too reliant on nuclear weapons to consider a new accord. China, for its part, seems uninterested in limits, possibly until it achieves parity with America. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indeed, parity has been the basis of arms control between America and Russia. But it is harder to agree on when three powers are involved. America, in particular, worries that Russia and China might ally against it, given that they have declared a \u201cfriendship without limits\u201d and conduct joint air and sea patrols. Mr Sullivan insists that America does not need \u201cto outnumber the combined total of our competitors\u201d to deter them. Yet the pressure for America to increase its numbers may prove irresistible, says James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank. As long as America\u2019s targeting policy rests on \u201ccounterforce\u201d\u2014aiming nuclear weapons at the other\u2019s nuclear sites to neutralise them\u2014more weapons in the hands of rivals will mean that America will need more, too.

Mr Sullivan proposed, for instance, extending the system of hotlines and notifications with Russia to all five permanent members of the un Security Council.

He summarised it thus: \u201cIf you wear a seat belt in a car, you\u2019re going to be incentivised to drive faster and more crazy, and then you\u2019ll have a crash. So, in a way, better not to have the seat belt.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Controlling the use of artificial intelligence is even harder, given that it cannot be seen and counted as ICBMs can.
