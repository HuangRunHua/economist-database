Tanks patrol the surrounding streets as soldiers dragoon hundreds of civilian prisoners, hands on their heads. Salvador Allende, the elected Socialist president, in tweed jacket and tin helmet, brandishes a pistol in La Moneda. By 2pm, he would die by his own hand.

An attempt by Mr Boric\u2019s government to rewrite Chile\u2019s constitution, which in part derives from Pinochet, was rejected by a whopping 62% of voters last year.

One, which has bedevilled the left in Chile and elsewhere for half a century, is whether Allende\u2019s overthrow was simply a crushing military defeat or whether it was above all a political failure.

To answer them, one must start by looking back at the thousand or so days of Allende\u2019s government that preceded its overthrow."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Elected in 1970, Allende had proclaimed \u201cthe Chilean road to socialism\u201d, an attempt to carry out a revolution by peaceful parliamentary means.

Pinochet\u2019s junta murdered 2,130 people and tortured at least 30,000, many cruelly, according to investigations under later democratic governments. The second was Allende\u2019s defiant final speech to the nation, broadcast from La Moneda at 9.10am. It lasted less than seven minutes, his voice calm and measured even amid shouting in the background. \u201cI will not resign,\u201d he declared. \u201cI will repay the loyalty of the people with my life...

A medical doctor, he was a self-declared \u201cMarxist Socialist president\u201d but also a bon vivant, a man with many lovers. He rejoiced in the friendship of Fidel Castro, inviting the Cuban revolutionary leader to Chile and allowing him to tour the country for 20 days. Allende\u2019s idea of socialism was the dismantling of the existing socioeconomic order and its replacement with state control. It was revolution and class struggle, not Scandinavian social democracy. But he was also an experienced Chilean parliamentarian, a former president of the Senate, a man of courtesy and charm who prided himself on his political mu\u00f1eca, his talent for negotiating and getting his way. He insisted that he would make his revolution within the law."}, {"role": "second", "text": "A cold-war confrontation"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chile stood out in Latin America because it had enjoyed stable civilian government since 1932. But its economy was dependent on American-owned copper companies; farming was dominated by large, inefficient estates. Allende\u2019s predecessor, Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat, had made a determined effort to change that, with land reform and the partial nationalisation of copper. Allende\u2019s election in 1970, at the fourth attempt, did not represent a big underlying shift to the left. He won just 36% of the 3m votes, only 39,000 more than a conservative rival.

Congress confirmed him as president."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As well as several small groups, the UP coalition was made up of two large parties, the Communists and Allende\u2019s own Socialists, a majority of whom at their congress in 1967 had declared the party Marxist-Leninist and endorsed revolutionary violence.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In office Allende implemented the UP programme: he completed the nationalisation of copper with opposition support, but resorted to legal chicanery to decree state takeovers of more than 150 large firms. \u201cWere changes on this scale possible? At first, yes, but it spun out of control,\u201d says Sergio Bitar, the mining minister at the end of Allende\u2019s government. Party militants simply seized scores of businesses, farms and even houses. Macroeconomic policy was recklessly populist, with big wage increases and an expansion of public jobs financed by printing money.

By 1973 Chile was at breaking point. Allende\u2019s measures and utopian vision forged a strong link with many Chileans: the UP won 43% of the vote in a legislative election in March 1973. But many others were alarmed. Mismanagement prompted inflation (which peaked at an annual rate of 600%), shortages and rationing. Allende brought military commanders into government, but did nothing to halt political polarisation and growing violence from extremist groups on the left and right. \u201cFor half of Chile, at least, it was a very scary time,\u201d notes David Gallagher, a Chilean banker and diplomat."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Allende was hostage to the UP, and it was split. For tactical reasons, and because this was Moscow\u2019s line, the Communists were cautious. The Socialist leadership, which was influenced by the MIR, wanted to accelerate. Allende vacillated. The best course was an agreement with the centrist Christian Democrats (DC). In a posthumous memoir published this year Patricio Aylwin, the DC party chief and later the first president of Chile\u2019s restored democracy, recounts three meetings with Allende. \u201cYou have to choose,\u201d Aylwin urged him. \u201cYou can\u2019t be on good terms with us and with the MIR\u201d. Allende reassured him that while he was president \u201cthere will be no dictatorship of the proletariat\u201d, which many in the UP were working towards.

On September 10th Mr Bitar attended a private lunch with Allende at which the president said that he had decided to call a plebiscite on the future of his government. It was too late. Senior military leaders were set on a coup, which Pinochet joined at the last minute.

There was some of that but not much\u2014and not as much as some in the media, including The Economist, feared. (Our coverage in 1973 gave too much credence to the claims of the right that the country was close to a civil war, and appears to have exaggerated the scale of far-left armed groups. However, our initial approach to Allende\u2019s government featured scepticism rather than outright rejection. We thought the coup was a \u201cregrettable inevitability\u201d, a view which some have criticised, although it was shared by many Chileans.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFor all practical purposes, fighting lasted four hours,\u201d Pinochet later declared.

It came as a total shock,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s Velasco, a former finance minister. Pinochet swiftly sidelined his fellow junta members and established a personal dictatorship. He was determined to liquidate Marxism in Chile, and the democracy he believed had enabled it to flourish. He was ruthless, turning his secret police into an instrument of state terror. Several rival generals died in mysterious circumstances. The secret police murdered Orlando Letelier, Allende\u2019s defence minister, with a brazen terrorist attack in Washington, DC. Libraries were purged not just of Marxist authors but also of works by liberals such as J.K. Galbraith. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pinochet\u2019s economic policy was another shock. Most Latin American armies believed in state-led industrialisation. But Pinochet was persuaded to hire the \u201cChicago boys\u201d, a group of young technocrats trained at that city\u2019s university under an exchange programme run by Chile\u2019s Catholic University. They were free-marketeers, disciples of Milton Friedman. They tore down tariff barriers and controls and privatised everything except the copper industry (the revenues of which went partly to the army). They made mistakes: a fixed and overvalued exchange rate and rampant insider lending by financial conglomerates crashed the economy in 1982. It recovered under more pragmatic management."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pinochet placed Chile \u201con track to sustained economic growth\u201d, legitimising entrepreneurship, the profit motive, market mechanisms and exports, Mr Mu\u00f1oz recognises. But he criticises Pinochet\u2019s creation of a \u201cmarket society\u201d, in which basic services were governed by profit, which has become a source of recent discontent in Chile. And Pinochet, like many dictators, would prove to be personally corrupt. He made history once again in 1998, when a Spanish judge issued an arrest warrant for the retired general while he was in London for medical treatment. The British government eventually sent him back to Chile, where he was charged and placed under house arrest for the disappearance and torture of political prisoners. This case was a milestone for the idea of universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity.

The Communist Party blamed its own caution and failure to arm the UP for what it saw as a military defeat. It began to pursue violent revolution. It set up a guerrilla group which came close to killing Pinochet in 1986 (which prompted another round of repression). Many Socialists engaged in a different kind of self-criticism. They identified crucial mistakes in the UP\u2019s strategy. The first was pursuing such a radical programme without a political or popular majority. A second was having scorned and lost the middle classes. That stemmed from a rigid Marxist outlook which failed to recognise that Chilean democracy had achieved social reform and a more egalitarian society. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another mistake was the UP\u2019s failure to grasp the realities of the cold war, notes Mr Bitar, who spent more than a year as a political prisoner in one of Pinochet\u2019s concentration camps. Faced with the implacable opposition of the United States, the Allende government assumed that the Soviet Union would bail it out. The Soviets did finance Allende\u2019s election campaign and the Chilean Communist Party. But they balked at Allende\u2019s demand for massive aid. They were already spending more than they could afford to keep Castro\u2019s Cuba afloat. Maoist China, preoccupied with Vietnam, turned Allende down as well. Despite the armed forces\u2019 constitutionalist tradition, which meant that they were reluctant to intervene, once they did so they were guided by the cold-war \u201cnational security doctrine\u201d under which they saw the left as an enemy to be exterminated."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230902_AMC371.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 1164.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Out of these reflections came an alliance between the Socialists and the Christian Democrats which had proved impossible in 1973.

The Concertaci\u00f3n governed, with much success, for the next two decades. Its leaders kept Pinochet\u2019s market economy, adding fiscal rigour and more social provision. That was particularly the case under Ricardo Lagos, the first socialist president since Allende. He reformed Pinochet\u2019s constitution of 1980, removing undemocratic clauses. Chile struck free-trade agreements with much of the world. Between 1990 and 2012 the economy grew at an average annual rate of over 5%.
