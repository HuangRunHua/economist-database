Although there is no full public record of Wagner\u2019s activities, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (acled), a research group, has sought to catalogue them using a patchwork of news articles, social-media posts and reports from human-rights groups. Since upping their presence in the CAR in 2020 and Mali in 2021, Wagner forces have been involved in some 35% and 10% of recorded violent events there, respectively."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230902_WOF906.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 3006.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Far from just fighting rebels, data from ACLED highlight Wagner\u2019s propensity for targeting civilians. Attacks on ordinary people\u2014which include abduction, sexual violence and torture\u2014account for almost half of Wagner\u2019s documented clashes in the CAR, and 60% in Mali.

Each Wagner attack on non-combatants recorded in the CAR led to four deaths on average, compared with just one in attacks involving the state or rebels.

There are reports of Wagner forces killing hundreds of people in single attacks, razing entire villages, and setting fire to homes with women and children trapped inside."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In total ACLED counts 1,800 deaths resulting from the group\u2019s attacks on African civilians.

Heavy-handed security makes them hotspots for violence against civilians."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is not yet clear what Mr Prigozhin\u2019s death will mean for Wagner or Russia\u2019s influence abroad (see Middle East & Africa section).
