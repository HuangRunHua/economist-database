The statistics are messy, but in some countries the trend is clear. In 2013-22 the number of Americans in the Netherlands increased from about 15,500 to 24,000; in Portugal it tripled to almost 10,000; and in Spain it rose from about 20,000 to nearly 34,000. In other places, such as France, Germany and the Nordic countries, the number grew moderately or held steady. Britain thinks the number of resident Americans rose from 137,000 in 2013 to 166,000 in 2021 (the latest estimate)."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230902_EUC327.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 739.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile, more and more Americans say they want out of their own country. Few of those who vowed to leave if Donald Trump were elected in 2016 actually did so. But Gallup, a pollster, found in 2018 that the share of Americans who said they would like to move permanently to another country had risen from 11% under Barack Obama to 16% under Mr Trump; by 2022 it was 17%, Joe Biden\u2019s election notwithstanding. The follow-through rate remains tiny: a few tens of thousands of \u00e9migr\u00e9s out of a population of 330m.

American workers toil for 1,811 hours a year, Europeans just 1,571; the well-rested Dutch put in a mere 1,427. The Netherlands once attracted Yanks seeking to smoke marijuana or marry same-sex partners. Now the attractions are more mainstream, Ms Metz says. The rise of international English makes things easier for Americans, who are notoriously bad at languages: 28% of the bachelor\u2019s programmes at Dutch universities are in English.

For Ms Johnson and her family, who are black, the central issues were racism and violence. She had been trying for years to persuade her husband Stanley, a lawyer, to move abroad. The strife after the murder of George Floyd in 2021 brought him around. He recalls saying: \u201c\u2018I think we need to get a gun.\u2019 When I said that out loud, I was like, if I have to live in a country where I need a gun to protect my family, then this is not the country for me.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stanley had a cross burned on his lawn while growing up in Virginia.

The huge increase in remote working during the pandemic made living abroad more feasible. And the European countries that lure the most Americans have set up tempting deals for foreigners. The Netherlands lets companies exempt 30% of skilled foreign workers\u2019 income from taxes. In Portugal a residential visa requires income of just 150% of the national minimum wage, or about \u20ac1,100 ($1,190) a month\u2014an easy hurdle for American retirees. Foreigners can pay a 10% flat tax on \u201cpassive income\u201d, such as investments or a pension. Spain\u2019s \u201cBeckham law\u201d offers a 24% flat tax for income earned in the country.

Many travel for education or work, fall in love and settle down. Still, she says, there has been a change. Americans once felt that their country was the ultimate immigrant nation; leaving seemed odd.

Instead they admire Europe\u2019s universal health care, efficient public transport, lower crime and lower income inequality. In a way, they envy the Europeans\u2019 liberty. \u25a0"}], "id": 35}
