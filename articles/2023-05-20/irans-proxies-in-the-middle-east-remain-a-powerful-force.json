This is a small radical group funded by Iran, which had been firing rockets at Israeli towns. Israel\u2019s strategy was clear. It wanted Hamas, the larger Islamist movement that controls Gaza, to stay out of the fight. This is because it has a much larger arsenal of rockets, many provided by Iran, which can paralyse life in Israel much more effectively. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The strategy worked. Hamas stayed on the sidelines until a ceasefire was brokered by Egypt. Israel hopes that it has driven a wedge between two Iranian allies on its borders. The deal has set back Iran\u2019s efforts to use its proxies to advance its regional ambitions and to attack\u2014albeit indirectly\u2014its chief enemies: Israel and America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Iran\u2019s proxies have always been a key part of its push to assert itself as a regional force. Since the early 1980s, groups backed by Iran such as Hizbullah, a militia-cum-party in Lebanon, and the Badr Organisation in Iraq have played big roles in the Islamic Republic\u2019s foreign policy. It has also projected its power through its support for the Houthis, who have menaced the Saudis in Yemen, as well as Hizbullah and the Palestinian factions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Iran\u2019s proxies both fulfil the ideological mission of exporting the Islamic revolution and serve as tools of diplomacy and coercion, says Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, a think-tank in Washington, dc. They have become ever more relevant as Israel\u2019s relations with its neighbours have improved through the Abraham accords, whereby in 2020 it agreed to establish formal ties with four Arab countries."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Israel has largely succeeded, through persistent air raids, in denying Iran a permanent military foothold in Syria. It has, however, failed to prevent Iran\u2019s proxies, Hizbullah and Hamas, from building up sizeable arsenals in Lebanon and Gaza. These may not represent an existential threat to Israel. But they do pose enough of a danger for it to have sought unofficial truces with them. In three of Israel\u2019s recent operations in Gaza, it has not targeted Hamas. Likewise, since the end of its war in 2006 with Hizbullah, the two seem to have agreed that though they can confront each other in Syrian territory, they will refrain from doing so in Lebanon. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are limits, anyway, to the power of Iran\u2019s proxies. \u201cUltimately Hizbullah and the other Shia militias were not enough to save Assad in Syria,\u201d says Raz Zimmt, an Iran-watcher at Israel\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies affiliated to Tel Aviv University. Iran had to deploy its own forces and in 2015 begged Russia to help prevent Syria\u2019s regime from falling. In Yemen, too, although Iran\u2019s supply of missiles and drones helped the Houthis harry the Saudis and their allies, some of the more sophisticated attacks, such as the ones on the Saudis\u2019 oil-processing facilities in September 2019, are believed to have been carried out by Iran itself.

These do not always align with those in Tehran. Such groups naturally consider their own local constituencies\u2019 interests. So they are not always prepared to do Iran\u2019s bidding. In recent weeks Israel has exploited this dynamic in Gaza. Iran wants its Palestinian clients there to act as a constant thorn in Israel\u2019s side. But as Israel\u2019s most recent strikes make clear, that is not necessarily to the good of the local population. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like the pij, Hamas gets funds from Iran. Unlike the pij, however, it is responsible for actually running Gaza. It also hopes one day to lead the broader Palestinian movement. As a result Hamas is split when it comes to Iran. Some members openly support the Islamic Republic. Others, including Yahya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019s chief in Gaza, are trying to stay less obviously aligned. Israel has encouraged this division by somewhat relaxing the blockade it has imposed in Gaza, with Egypt\u2019s co-operation. It has allowed 20,000 day-labourers to enter Israel, where they earn desperately needed money. Because Mr Sinwar is loth to jeopardise this, he is reluctant to join the joint command structure Iran seeks to establish for its proxies on Israel\u2019s borders."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The biggest weakness of Iran\u2019s proxy strategy lies closer to home. As the country\u2019s economy teeters, investing scant resources in arming foreign militias is feeding resentment among Iranians. And ironically, though its proxies have been central in Iran\u2019s foreign policy, its position in the Middle East has been bolstered by more conventional means. On March 10th Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia, hoping this will go some way to ending its economic isolation. Still, others will keep up the pressure against Iran as long as it destabilises the region elsewhere. Rather than enhance Iran\u2019s geopolitical might, the proxies risk becoming a major obstacle. \u25a0"}], "id": 26}
