A Kabul-based animal-rescue charity called Nowzad, run by a former British soldier, created such a fuss in the British press that Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, permitted it to load 94 stray dogs and 68 cats onto one of the last flights out of the country. They were the lucky ones. Kabul\u2019s street-dog population ballooned as Afghans abandoned their pooches before fleeing the country."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWe found lots of well-trained, rare breeds in the early days,\u201d says Mohammed Ismail, a vet with another British animal charity, called Mayhew. When Kabul fell, Mayhew told its Afghan staff to stay at home. As a British organisation, it feared reprisals. It also assumed the Taliban hated dogs, which pious Muslims consider impure. But it was not long before Mayhew was asked by the Taliban to get back to work."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Every day at dawn, the charity sends its vets out with dog-catchers from Kabul\u2019s Taliban-controlled administration. Armed with giant nets, most days they nab about 60 strays, which they neuter and inoculate against rabies. After a few days\u2019 recuperation at the charity\u2019s facilities, the curs are returned to the streets. The Taliban mayor of Kabul is said to be delighted with this work. His administration recently chalked up Mayhew\u2019s vaccination of around 30,000 stray dogs as one of its successes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nowzad has also now returned to Kabul, where its activities include running a small-animal clinic. The Taliban have permitted the NGO to \u201ccontinue with our mission objectives\u201d, says Nowzad\u2019s founder, Pen Farthing, a former Royal Marine. During his five recent visits to Kabul, he found the Taliban amenable and \u201calways polite and friendly\u201d. He thinks the international community should stop shunning them. \u201cThey are back in power because we put them back in power,\u201d he suggests, a tad cynically."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mayhew says it fully complies with the Taliban\u2019s rules, including an order banning NGOs from employing women. \u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d says Caroline Yates of Mayhew. \u201cBut we are first and foremost an animal-welfare organisation.\u201d\u25a0"}], "id": 12}
