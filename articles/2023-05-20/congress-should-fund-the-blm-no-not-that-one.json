Greg Hunt (Jon Gries) is bewildered. Tanya, like many Americans, assumes that the initials stand for Black Lives Matter, an anti-racism group. \u201cBlack Lives Matter? I\u2019m not involved in that,\u201d he replies. Now it is Tanya\u2019s turn for bewilderment. Finally, Greg reveals that he works for a distinctly different BLM: America\u2019s Bureau of Land Management. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Bureau of Land Management (the BLM from here on) is not one of America\u2019s better-known federal agencies. It is just one of 11 bureaus within the Department of the Interior, and is responsible for managing 10% of America\u2019s lands, or more than 245m acres, mostly in the western states. It issues permits for development on the country\u2019s public lands. For a long time, that meant approving oil and gas drilling. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But under President Joe Biden, it increasingly means granting permits for renewable-energy projects. The Biden administration aims to approve at least 25 gigawatts of solar, wind or geothermal energy on federal lands by 2025, and so the BLM finds itself at the very centre of America\u2019s clean-energy transition. But the bureau will struggle to thrive in the limelight. When asked about the state of the BLM, current and former staffers describe an underfunded agency tormented by an increasingly difficult mission and hobbled by staffing shortages. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1976 Congress passed the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, or FLPMA. The agency was tasked with balancing extraction, recreation and conservation, in perpetuity. Land-use conflicts are multiplying as the agency tries to deploy renewables, protect critical habitat, respect tribal sovereignty and manage a boom in outdoor recreation all at the same time. \u201cI\u2019ve been in a lot of angry public meetings,\u201d says Linda Price, the BLM\u2019s field manager in Salmon, Idaho. \u201cThey don\u2019t get any more angry than when there\u2019s renewable energy involved.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Idaho is a case in point. The proposed Lava Ridge Wind Project in the state\u2019s Magic Valley, near a Japanese prison camp from the second world war, has united greens, history preservationists, tribes, local officials, ranchers and farmers in opposition. Not only are locals sceptical of these specific turbines; some reject the idea that renewables belong on public lands at all. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The BLM is used to getting beaten up at public meetings. But the listening tours needed to solicit local input and dispel disinformation take time. That is something America does not have in abundance if it wants to decarbonise fast enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Last month, for example, the BLM approved the construction of a high-voltage transmission line from Wyoming\u2019s High Plains to southern Nevada. The project was first proposed in 2007, but was delayed by a legal battle over whether the line could traverse ranchlands that were also protected habitat for the ever-imperilled sage grouse. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Grousing sagely"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The bureau\u2019s broad mission also makes it vulnerable to big political swings. The Trump administration, for example, prioritised fossil-fuel development over other land uses. \u201cThe last administration didn\u2019t want you to even think about conservation,\u201d says Mary Jo Rugwell, who retired as the BLM\u2019s Wyoming boss in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for employees to make that pivot all the time,\u201d she adds wearily. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second reason the BLM is struggling is because the agency was crippled by President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d. In 2019 Mr Trump announced that the agency\u2019s headquarters would move from Washington, DC, to Grand Junction, Colorado, ostensibly so the BLM\u2019s bureaucrats would be closer to the lands they managed. More than 300 jobs were reassigned to western field offices. Just 41 people moved and only three ended up in Grand Junction. The rest quit or retired. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Baby-boomer retirements and a national labour shortage aren\u2019t helping things. Tracy Stone-Manning, the agency\u2019s director under Mr Biden, argues that too few people, and the loss of expertise that accompanied the headquarters move, explain the BLM\u2019s inefficiency, not an over-onerous permit process. When your correspondent asked which projects had suffered for lack of bodies, Ms Stone-Manning was not picky. \u201cI\u2019d point to 120 projects that are waiting in line, they\u2019re literally sitting on desks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say to a company \u2018See you in two years\u2019.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is not hard to find specific examples of pain caused by the labour crunch. Agents working on the Lava Ridge wind-farm proposal say the controversial project is sucking up all their time and resources. They want to hire more people to focus entirely on renewables. Farther north in Salmon, Ms Price is trying to prioritise. \u201cIf you doubled my staff, we would not run out of things to do,\u201d she says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The BLM is dreaming of a bigger budget, too, and has asked Congress for more funding to hire nearly 500 employees. Its headquarters is moving back to the Beltway. But some of the bureau\u2019s far-flung agents think the agency\u2019s redemption will happen in the valleys and the mountains of the West, rather than in Washington. \u201cThe number and diversity of conflicts is growing,\u201d says Ms Price. \u201cOn the ground, in the little immediate field offices, we try to work through them one by one.\u201d\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 23}
