Covering more than 43 acres, it will be the second-biggest diplomatic outpost in the world, surpassed only by America\u2019s embassy in Baghdad. It is set to cost $1bn, about the same as the United States\u2019 mission in London, the costliest the country has ever built. The immenseness of its scale suggests America has no plan to abandon its role in the Middle East. But it also highlights the superpower\u2019s difficulties."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The new embassy in Beirut will be surrounded by towering concrete walls and barbed-wire fences. \u201cIs that an embassy or a military base?\u201d asked people on Twitter when photographs of the development were shared. Like the existing embassy, it sits in Akwar, a leafy suburb, far from the city centre. Security is plainly the dominant factor, as it now is across the world. Even in London, considered a lot less dangerous than capitals such as Baghdad or Beirut, a moat runs around the embassy. America\u2019s ten-storey embassy in Cairo, built in 1980, is now surrounded by a cordon of concrete blast shields."}, {"role": "body", "text": "America\u2019s emphasis on security when it comes to building embassies has its roots in Lebanon. In April 1983 the Islamic Jihad Organisation, a forerunner of Hizbullah, bombed the American embassy in Beirut. The attack killed 63 people and destroyed much of the building. Next year Hizbullah set off a car-bomb that killed 23 people at an annex of the embassy. Those attacks prompted America to focus overwhelmingly on security when designing and building its embassies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That principle was codified in 1985 by Bobby Ray Inman, a recently retired admiral, in a report for the State Department. It included a series of guidelines for American diplomatic buildings and for those working in them. The facilities, it was argued, should be located within a single, well-defended perimeter far away from heavily populated areas."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The threat of terrorism is a real problem for American embassies, says Elliott Abrams, a former assistant secretary of state, but the isolation and fortress-like appearance of American embassies give a bad impression. And local Beirutis do not expect to benefit from the new edifice. \u201cPeople from the embassy don\u2019t buy things here,\u201d says a chemist whose shop abuts the site. \u201cThey bring everything with them\u2014they fly it in by helicopter.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Suspicion of America already runs deep in the Middle East, so cutting its diplomats off from the local populace hardly improves things, especially in places such as Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, where relations with America have generally been friendly. Nowadays embassy staff are barred from using public transport or living outside official residences. It is a real loss, says Mr Abrams, if American diplomats cannot travel freely within the country or mix with the locals. The size of the new embassy in Lebanon suggests a worthy commitment to remain engaged in the Middle East. But the diplomats who work there will need to find a way to sally beyond its walls. \u25a0"}], "id": 27}
