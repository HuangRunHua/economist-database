So more than a year ago he left his wife and baby son at home and walked for three months, dodging immigration patrols and predatory smugglers, before fording the Rio Grande and requesting asylum. Unable to work legally, he said he considered returning home, but as a police officer who had left his post, he would be in danger. Mr Rivas, a tall man with an aristocratic bearing, held himself together until he showed a picture of his son, now two. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to leave your family behind,\u201d he said, taking off his glasses to wipe away tears.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Adams has accused Mr Abbott, who is white, of targeting \u201cblack-run cities\u201d. But he has also excoriated President Joe Biden. In April he said Mr Biden had \u201cfailed\u201d the city, and warned it was \u201cbeing destroyed by the migrant crisis\u201d. More than 60,000 people seeking asylum have arrived in New York since last spring, only some on Mr Abbott\u2019s buses. Roughly 41,000 are in shelters operated or paid for by the city.

They say their shelters and schools are already strained by asylum-seekers who came on their own. Mr Adams is doing far more than Mr Abbott in promising to support the people on his buses for four months, but upstate officials wonder what will happen after that. They are suing to block the buses."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWe can\u2019t operate this way,\u201d says Thomas Humbach, the Rockland county attorney, who successfully sought a temporary restraining order to stop Mr Adams from sending migrants there. \u201cYou have jurisdictional borders, you have territorial borders for a reason, so that people can run their areas the way they think they should be run.\u201d Like Mr Adams and Mr Abbott, Mr Humbach believes the federal government should rationalise immigration rather than leave each state, county or city struggling to harden its own borders. Some New York officials also want expedited permission for asylum-seekers to work."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After Title 42, a pandemic-era border restriction, expired earlier this month, officials feared a surge of migrants. But new penalties for illegal crossings imposed by the Biden administration, combined with new mechanisms for receiving asylum requests, appear to have headed that off. Mr Biden, who has shifted to the centre on immigration as he runs for re-election, has come under criticism from his left for the restrictions and from his right as not being tough enough. The White House rightly says immigration reform requires action from Congress, where many representatives seem to prefer to have the problem to campaign on.

Leaving a two-year-old son behind, Mrs Ramos left Honduras in the late 1980s and crossed the border with a coyote. She made her way to New York state, held down two jobs, and was later joined by her husband, who also crossed illegally. The couple was later able to gain legal status and bring their son, by then nine, from Honduras. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "They had a daughter in America in 1992 and called her Genesis.
