Just ask George Santos. The impossibly industrious congressman from New York chose Melbourne as the headquarters for his company, Devolder Organisation, LLC, which, federal prosecutors allege, he used to defraud campaign donors. The Middle District of Florida, Melbourne\u2019s federal court, could have lassoed its jurisdictional powers onto this geographical hook. Instead, on May 10th, Mr Santos walked into a courthouse on Long Island. He pleaded not guilty to charges filed by the Eastern District of New York (EDNY), as so many extraordinary defendants have done before him. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "EDNY\u2019s jurisdiction covers Brooklyn (where its main courthouse sits), Queens, Staten Island and Long Island\u2014a diverse constituency of 8m people plus an international airport.

Brooklyn\u2019s eagle logs serious miles. Carlos Watson who ran Ozy, a scandal-ridden media company, lives in California. But from an inopportune outing Mr Watson took to the US Open, a tennis tournament in Queens, enterprising EDNY lawyers found legal jurisdiction, or \u201cvenue\u201d, to indict him for fraud."}, {"role": "body", "text": "R. Kelly, a singer convicted of sex abuse, committed most of his crimes in Chicago, but EDNY scored the first trial.

In such investigations, venue is often unclear. There is no default court to try the murder of an American diplomat in Niger by a man from Mali, as was done in Brooklyn in 2016. Since 2003 EDNY\u2019s prosecutors have tried more international terrorism cases than any other district court, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a database.

After September 11th, Kelly Currie, the former deputy chief of the department overseeing terrorism investigations, says that a \u201csea change\u201d in resources allowed EDNY to focus on disrupting plots.

Another, Shreve Ariail, travelled to Sicily in 2011 after getting a tip that an al-Qaeda operative had turned up on a passenger ship from Libya.

FBI agents around the country began to approach EDNY with their cases."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Brooklyn\u2019s reputation for treating the FBI almost like a client is one reason agents bring their high-profile cases to EDNY.

As for EDNY\u2019s hustle, Mr Santos harbours a similar complaint.
