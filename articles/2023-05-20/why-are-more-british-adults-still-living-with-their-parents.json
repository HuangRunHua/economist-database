You might suppose that the covid-19 pandemic had caused more youngsters to stay or return home. Perhaps, but the ONS says that around 90% of adults living with their parents had done so for at least a year, the same as in 2011. Nor does ethnicity seem to explain the shift. The share of multi-generational Asian households, the highest among any ethnic group, fell. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The likeliest explanation is that many young adults cannot afford to buy or rent their own homes. In the first 20 years of the century, according to The Economist\u2019s house-price index, British property prices almost doubled. According to Halifax, a lender, the average age of first-time buyers is now 32. Not surprisingly London, which has the priciest housing, also had the highest proportion of households with grown-up children: 26.8%. In the borough of Brent, in the north-west of the city, the share was almost one in three. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The squeeze on housing costs and living space is tightest in poor households. Not only are rents high, says Molly Broome of the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, but for many years the provision of social housing\u2014for which many young people on low incomes would have been eligible in the past\u2014has failed to keep pace with demand. Local Housing Allowance (a rent subsidy), which was increased at the start of the pandemic in 2020, has been frozen since then."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lone parents were likelier than couples to have adult children at home. In London, more than half did. Homes with grown-up children are more likely to be classed as overcrowded\u2014meaning, for example, that adults not in a couple, or more than two teenagers of the same sex, share a bedroom. In London almost one in four families with adult children was overcrowded, against one in 15 in north-east England."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since the census was taken, double-digit inflation, and especially rising rents and mortgage rates, have added to young people\u2019s incentive to stay in the parental home while they save.
