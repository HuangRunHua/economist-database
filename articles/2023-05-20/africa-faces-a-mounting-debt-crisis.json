Ghana will get a first tranche of $600m immediately, though further infusions will probably require progress on cutting its debt burden. Zambia, which like Ghana is in default on its sovereign loans, has struggled to agree to detailed terms for restructuring its debt. But it hopes to achieve a deal next month.

The first was in the 1980s and 1990s, which led to a crisis that eventually resulted in big write-offs by rich countries. It was exacerbated by weak commodity prices and slow economic growth. Average real GDP per person in Africa shrank in both decades."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second period of rising debt was in the 2000s and 2010s, when African countries looked beyond aid and cheap loans from multilateral institutions. From 2007 to 2020, 21 of them borrowed on global capital markets, many for the first time. China\u2019s financiers lent $160bn to African governments from 2000 to 2020. Domestic capital markets were increasingly tapped, too. Between 2010 and 2020, African government debt that is held domestically increased from an average 15% of GDP to 30%.

One Zambian source recalls that in 2014 officials sought to sell only a $500m Eurobond (a bond in a currency other than your own) but yield-hungry investors coaxed them into doubling the issuance. \u201cWe did it because we could,\u201d he says.

Public debt as a share of GDP reached an average of 56% in sub-Saharan Africa in 2022, the highest level since the early 2000s, exacerbated in part by covid-19 and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. That may not look high by rich-world standards, but it is barely affordable in Africa, where interest rates are much higher. Moreover, 40% of Africa\u2019s debt is denominated in foreign currencies, making countries prey to the vicissitudes of exchange rates. This year sub-Saharan African countries\u2019 spending on servicing external debts (both interest and principal repayments) will reach 17% of government revenues, the highest level since 1999, according to Debt Justice, a British NGO.

These are either too well-run to have racked up high debt levels (eg, Botswana) or too badly run to have attracted mainstream commercial creditors (many of the rest).

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "China is far from the only headache for debt-laden African countries. Before it defaulted last year, Ghana had almost as much domestic debt as foreign debt.

Part of the problem is that the government has collected little money from oil recently due to rampant oil theft, low production and the cost of fuel subsidies, which are deducted before oil proceeds reach the treasury. Bola Tinubu, Nigeria\u2019s incoming president, promises to fix the oily mess, but so have many past presidents of his country.
