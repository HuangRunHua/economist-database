Hopes for renewed artistic freedom have been dashed by political caution. This month, some in China have reminisced about an event 40 years ago that came to symbolise the dream of openness: the visit in 1983 of Arthur Miller to direct his play \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The country Miller visited that spring was still emerging from the wreckage of Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution. But it already crackled with the electricity of creative experiments. Though a campaign would soon be launched to control \u201cspiritual pollution\u201d, artists sometimes enjoyed a surprising and exhilarating leeway. Gao Xingjian, a playwright who had translated avant-garde Western work in secret, began staging his own absurdist plays in the early 1980s. (He left China in 1987 and won the Nobel prize for literature in 2000.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, two film-makers, would in 1984 release the first of a new wave of Chinese films, \u201cYellow Earth\u201d, which, as well as being visually rich and beautiful, took a nuanced view of life in China. The new freedoms extended to some foreign artists, too. After arriving with 60 musicians and 15 tonnes of stage kit in 1981, Jean-Michel Jarre dazzled the emerging Chinese music scene\u2014and strained the power grid\u2014with the five concerts he played in Beijing and Shanghai."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Into this ferment stepped America\u2019s greatest living playwright. Long fascinated with China, Miller first visited as a tourist in 1978. This time he had six weeks to direct a Chinese cast, in a language he did not speak, performing his critique of the American dream of 1949. (Beset by failure and frustration, and haunted by his past adultery, Willy Loman, the salesman of the title, retreats into fantasy and ultimately kills himself.) Many Chinese artists look back at the production as a high point of cultural engagement with America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At its heart was Miller\u2019s partnership with Ying Ruocheng, a celebrated Chinese actor who translated the script and played Willy. \u201cI have never had this kind of relationship with an actor,\u201d Miller said of Ying. Born into a prominent family in Beijing, Ying first read \u201cSalesman\u201d as an undergraduate in 1949, just as Communist China was closing to the world. It stuck with him through the turmoil of the Mao years, during which he was imprisoned. He and Miller discussed working together in 1978. Miller had wanted to stage \u201cThe Crucible\u201d, his allegory of the McCarthyite witch-hunts that also echoed the Cultural Revolution. Ying persuaded him that \u201cSalesman\u201d would be \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d, looking forward, not back. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Miller kept a diary, published in 1984 as \u201cSalesman in Beijing\u201d. In it he records how, at the first rehearsal, he told the actors that he wanted to discuss \u201cthe problem of how to act like Americans\u201d. The answer was simple: \u201cYou must not attempt to act like Americans at all.\u201d This meant ditching the Chinese convention of actors donning blond wigs and heavy make-up to try to look like Westerners. As Ying later put it, he and Miller wanted audiences \u201cto know the pulse of [the characters\u2019] hearts, not the colour of their hair\u201d. Slowly, the cast adapted. \u201cIt soon turned out that the Moon is the Moon and actors are actors,\u201d Miller wrote; \u201cthe same everywhere.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some cultural divides were harder to bridge. \u201cThere were not many salesmen in Beijing in those days,\u201d recalls Li Shilong, who played Biff, one of Willy\u2019s sons. More fundamentally, Chinese audiences were not used to moral ambiguity. The scene in which Willy\u2019s affair is revealed was a worry. Miller realised that one of the virtues of \u201cSalesman\u201d was its invitation to sympathise with a flawed man\u2014in other words, that it \u201clet the real world into Chinese art\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Opening night on May 7th, attended by the American ambassador and other dignitaries, was a triumph. \u201cThe audience rushed forward to the edge of the stage, shouting and pointing,\u201d Ying would recall. \u201cWe have very few dramas like this, and none of this intensity,\u201d a young Chinese man told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe are very big on politics, the problems of the society, on history and so forth, but very rarely does one deal with the problems of the person, of the individual in society.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "What recommended the play to Chinese audiences, agrees Mr Li (now 77), was its focus on relationships. \u201cChinese are keen on families,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone has parents. Everyone has siblings.\u201d In cultural terms, the production was \u201ca watershed moment\u201d in Sino-American relations, says Claire Conceison of MIT, who co-wrote \u201cVoices Carry\u201d, Ying\u2019s autobiography. \u201cIt brought in a new type of play that blended realism and Expressionism, and also a new approach to depicting foreigners onstage.\u201d Chinese officialdom made surprisingly little use of Miller\u2019s critique of capitalism: the post-Mao urge to re-engage with the world was still strong. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Miller left straight after the premiere. The play ran for over 50 performances in Beijing, then toured Hong Kong and Singapore. Ying went on to translate and direct other Western plays, such as, in 1986, \u201cAmadeus\u201d by Peter Shaffer. The next year he was cast in Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s film \u201cThe Last Emperor\u201d. By then his skill in navigating tricky political terrain had earned him an appointment as the country\u2019s vice-minister of culture. He helped bring Charlton Heston to Beijing to direct \u201cThe Caine Mutiny Court-Martial\u201d in 1988. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Things changed, though, with the killing of hundreds of protesters in Beijing the next year. Ying resigned from the government in 1990 (he did not stop acting and directing). For years, experimentation became rarer and riskier. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the episode continues to resonate. Ying died in 2003, Miller in 2005, but the collaboration between the two artistic giants is an enduring source of fascination for Western Sinophiles. The story of \u201cSalesman\u201d in Beijing is the focus of two separate plays currently in development, one in New York, the other in Canada. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Theatre professionals in China have had to battle with a difficult system. \u201cChina is not lacking in good writers,\u201d says Mr Li, the actor, but \u201cwriters cannot write what they want.\u201d Nevertheless, the influence of \u201cSalesman\u201d lingers. Western shows (if only the uncontroversial kind) draw crowds today. In Shanghai \u201cThe Woman in Black\u201d, a ghost story adapted from London\u2019s West End, recently played to packed houses. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Attention must finally be paid"}, {"role": "body", "text": "And as China\u2019s economy and society have evolved, some art forms have been reinvigorated (even if political themes remain off-limits). Critics in Beijing praised a recent production of \u201cSunrise\u201d, a penetrating drama set in the 1930s by Cao Yu, who met Miller on both his visits. New experimental work is emerging too, says Professor Conceison. She points to Meng Jinghui, a director who mixes \u201cplayfulness with social commentary and dystopian elements\u201d and whose shows have toured America, Europe and Australia. \u201cThere is a vibrant theatre scene in China,\u201d she says, \u201cand it is gaining traction globally.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Flawed heroes are now familiar on the Chinese stage. Another well-known director, Li Liuyi, put on a revival of \u201cSalesman\u201d in 2012 and says it felt much more relevant in 21st-century China than it did in 1983. These days middle-class audiences can sympathise with the struggles and fears Miller depicts. Four decades ago, Willy Loman was an ambassador from an alien world; today he is no longer a stranger. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 73}
