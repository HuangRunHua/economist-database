Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, went to open doors to his country\u2019s trade. Emmanuel Macron ostentatiously sought to strike a partnership with Xi Jinping.

They also need to decide what they would do if America became more demanding. In an extreme case, in the event of a war over Taiwan, Europe might be expected to impose sanctions on China like those it has slapped on Russia, and to back a military campaign.
