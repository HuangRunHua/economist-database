Often it refers to tales of humdrum lives that lack the hoopla of seismic themes, exotic settings, twists and gore. A quiet book, in literary-speak, is one that doesn\u2019t sell. More than ever, a quietly humane film is likely to be shouted down by superheroes. That is a shame, as quiet art can be moving and profound."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWestern Lane\u201d, a debut novel by Chetna Maroo, is audacious in its quietness. Gopi, its 11-year-old narrator, is the youngest of three Gujarati sisters in southern England whose mother has died. Their bereft father gets them to take up squash; Gopi aims to play in a tournament. She befriends a boy called Ged, visits relatives, goes to a funfair."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This restrained plot is related in a boldly understated style. Tune into its wavelength, though, and you hear a symphony of emotion. Through the half-understood exchanges and scenes her narrator recounts, Ms Maroo beautifully conveys the eddies of guilt and recrimination in a bereaved home, and the way feelings can be experienced as physical sensations (proximity to Ged \u201cmade my heart stand up\u201d). She shows how thoughts can be expressed without words: Gopi reads her father\u2019s despair in \u201chis shoulders, his throat, the white bones visible under his skin\u201d. Squash embodies her struggle to contain the turmoil of grief and growing up."}, {"role": "body", "text": "William Wordsworth made the case for a similar approach to art in 1800. His poetry would describe \u201csituations from common life\u201d, he avowed, and employ \u201clanguage really used by men\u201d; feelings would take precedence over action. In a lament that is eerily apposite in the lurid age of social media, Wordsworth decried the \u201ccraving for extraordinary incident, which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies\u201d. He was sure \u201cthe human mind is capable of being excited without the application of gross and violent stimulants\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cOne Fine Morning\u201d, a new film by Mia Hansen-Love, is exciting in the way Wordsworth meant. Its opening sequence is screamingly quiet. Sandra, a widowed mother played by L\u00e9a Seydoux, goes to see her father in his Paris flat. He is losing his memory and sight and has trouble letting her in. Next she picks up her daughter from school and takes her to a park. Her job as a translator, including at a ceremony on Omaha Beach, offers fleeting glimpses of wider issues. But her own quiet dramas are defiantly the main event."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cYou must show you\u2019re there,\u201d another infirm relative tells Sandra, explaining why she still ventures outside. \u201cThat you\u2019re a living person.\u201d This is the film\u2019s philosophy: depicting a quiet-seeming life, it insists that lives are rarely quiet for the people who are living them. Sandra\u2019s commitments pile up and collide, as they often can. Her father has to be institutionalised, her child develops phantom aches, she begins an affair with a married friend. In a quietly exquisite moment, she is taking a bus back from a harrowing old-people\u2019s home when a text from her lover arrives; she looks over her shoulder, abashed in her joy, then starts to cry. Her happy-sad tears are reflected in the bus\u2019s darkening window."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Your reflection is everywhere in Yayoi Kusama\u2019s immersive \u201cInfinity Mirror Rooms\u201d at Tate Modern in London.

Two floors down, a show devoted to Magdalena Abakanowicz is quieter and deeper."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though she eventually made some grand public sculptures, the Polish artist worked principally with textiles, a medium liable to be dismissed as antiquated or (chauvinistically) as feminine and domestic\u2014in other words, quiet. Abakanowicz declared that she was \u201cinterested in the path of a single thread\u201d. In the late 1960s, that path veered off the walls on which textiles traditionally hung, and her sisal, burlap and horsehair threads took on three dimensions.

They look as if they could cradle or entomb you. Rope spills like entrails from one; another resembles a heart, with openings that might be arteries.
