Of the passengers who aren\u2019t soldiers on their way to nearby Bakhmut, almost all on board are the wives and girlfriends of those already fighting. Viktoria, 27, and Karolina, 29, have travelled to see their men Alexander, 32, and Vladimir, 33, who are waiting for them on the platform. A day before, Alexander and Vladimir were fighting fierce battles in Bakhmut. Now they have swapped their rifles for roses. The couples embrace silently, and depart for rented apartments on the outskirts.

On the front line since 2014, Russia\u2019s renewed onslaught in February 2022 brought its very existence into question. Within a few weeks, Kramatorsk\u2019s factories shut down and most of its civilian population fled. Now the city is profoundly militarised. But it exudes a new kind of energy as a romantic hub for soldiers who aren\u2019t allowed to travel far from fighting in Bakhmut and Avdiivka. There may be no hotels\u2014they closed after one was bombed last summer\u2014but a network of apartments, rentable by the day or hour, fills the gap. The city\u2019s tourist infrastructure\u2014flower shops, gift shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s\u2014has prospered.

At 1,000 hryvnia ($27) for 24 hours, Artyom\u2019s going rate is twice the pre-war level, and as expensive as in parts of Kyiv. But demand is strong, fuelled by good military salaries. The women usually arrive on the express train on Saturday, he says, and stay for a day or two. \u201cThe town comes to life at weekends, with couples walking arm-in-arm through the park, even with the booms and sirens of war.\u201d The nearest Russian positions to Kramatorsk are 20km away, putting the city within easy range of multiple-rocket systems and S-300 missiles.
