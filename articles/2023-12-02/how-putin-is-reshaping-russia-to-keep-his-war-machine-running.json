The original, inaugurated in 1939 just weeks before Germany and Russia invaded Poland, papered over the famine and terror of the preceding years. Instead, displays extolled the wonders of Soviet science and the virtues of collectivisation; a special ice-cream hall doled out treats to the masses and a 25-metre statue of Stalin gazed down munificently.

A pavilion celebrating Russia\u2019s regions features Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhia, four provinces the Russian army is currently attempting to seize from Ukraine. The only hint of the continuing bloodshed is a flower composed of bits of shrapnel. The initiation of the biggest war in Europe since 1945, the re-imposition of a police state within Russia and the categorical reversal of the reforming and Westernising trends of the early post-Soviet period are nowhere to be seen."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is an especially far cry from the shock and confusion of the early days of the war, when the rouble plunged, hundreds of thousands fled the country and protests rocked Russia\u2019s cities. Mr Putin has since succeeded in stabilising the economy, thanks to the high price of oil, and in squelching dissent, thanks to fierce repression. That has allowed him to retain the allegiance of the elite, who in turn are helping the country adapt. The new equilibrium is unstable, however, with the economy and military recruitment, in particular, threatening further upheaval."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Unsheepish sheep"}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the face of things, most Russians have meekly accepted the war in Ukraine, which will soon be two years old.

Despite their professed support for the war, the respondents to Russian Field\u2019s polls are firmly against a further round of mobilisation, even if Mr Putin himself calls for it. In October, for the first time during the war, a majority of respondents expressed support for peace talks over continued fighting (see chart 1).

More strikingly, however, the richer and more educated people are, the more supportive they are (see chart 2). As an anonymous Russian academic explains in a recent article in Meduza, an online publication, there is a big class of bureaucrats and businessmen who have attained their status through patronage and who will uphold the regime to protect it. \u201cThey number millions and they have fitted into the moral economy of military aggression,\u201d the academic writes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In part, such people are kept in line by fear, like everyone else. In the first months of the war a spate of mysterious deaths of businessmen and managers at state-owned firms helped to instil fealty. The chairman of the board of Lukoil, Russia\u2019s biggest private oil firm, fell to his death from a hospital window in Moscow a few months after the board issued a statement calling for a ceasefire.

Andrei Yakovlev of Harvard University, who has conducted a survey of Russian entrepreneurs, says that having lived through several financial crises and done constant battle with predatory bureaucrats, they put a premium on preparing for the worst. The disappearance of Western imports and the closure of Western firms, meanwhile, has opened new niches for Russian companies. At the same time, the capital controls imposed by the central bank have left them with few options but to invest in Russia. The government has offered loans and even ordered bureaucrats not to harass them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It helps, of course, that vast quantities of petrodollars have been sloshing around the economy. In the first year of the war Russia earned $590bn in export revenues\u2014most of it from oil and gas. According to calculations by Re: Russia, a network of experts, that is $160bn more than the annual average over the prior decade. In the second year, revenues should still be some $60bn above the average. Re: Russia believes that the war costs at least $100bn a year\u2014so the extra income from oil covers most of the expense of waging it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government\u2019s budget increased by 26% last year and will rise by another 16% next year. Defence spending will almost double next year, to 6% of GDP\u2014the highest it has been since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It now accounts for a third of all government expenditure. Spending on health and education, meanwhile, is falling in real terms. As Anton Siluanov, the finance minister, recently declared, \u201cThe main emphasis is on ensuring our victory. The army, defence capability, armed forces, fighters\u2014everything needed for the front, everything needed for victory is in the budget.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such lavish outlays will not be sustainable indefinitely. The central bank is struggling to restrain rising inflation, which reached 12% year on year in the third quarter of this year. It has raised interest rates to 15%. The authorities, meanwhile, are forcing exporters to convert their revenues to roubles to stave off further devaluation, which would exacerbate inflation. Some 43% of Russians expect their economic situation to worsen in the next year or two, while only 21% expect it to improve, according to Russian Field."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the moment, however, there is a bonanza, especially in certain parts of the economy and certain segments of Russian society. \u201cUnlike oil, guns drive industrial growth,\u201d argue Alexandra Prokopenko and Pavel Luzin at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, a think-tank. Construction, consumption and services are growing in regions close to the war zone or with lots of munitions factories. In the far east there is heavy investment in infrastructure to expand trade with Asia, since ties to Europe have withered. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Moscow and St Petersburg do not benefit much from the new order, but depressed industrial regions\u2014Mr Putin\u2019s heartland\u2014are living better than they have for years. In Izhevsk, a poor city close to the Ural mountains which produces guns, missiles and equipment for electronic warfare, the average salary has gone up by 25% since the start of the war. An organic supermarket, VkusVill, and a pan-Asian restaurant, Royal Rolls, recently opened. In Rostov-on-Don, the headquarters of the military district encompassing the front, catering businesses are seeing a 77% increase in turnover. \u201cA lot of men with good appetites have arrived there,\u201d says Ms Zubarevich. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s vast and poor hinterland has also benefited from the cash the authorities are dangling in order to secure more recruits to the army. Those who volunteer are paid around 195,000 roubles a month, four times the newly increased average salary in Izhevsk, and a one-off bonus on enlistment of 195,000 roubles. The families of those killed in battle receive generous payments, too. Vladislav Inozemtsev, a Russian economist at the Polish Institute of Advanced Studies in Warsaw, estimates that the family of a soldier who gets killed after five months\u2019 service would receive about 15m roubles in total, including pay and compensation. It would take an average Russian man 30 years to earn as much. Life expectancy for a Russian man is only 65. Mr Putin\u2019s regime is trying to turn getting killed into an economically rational choice, argues Mr Inozemtsev."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nonetheless, Russia appears to have a manpower problem. The forced mobilisation announced a year ago\u2014the first since the second world war\u2014caused panic and anger. Enlistment commissions were set ablaze and hundreds of thousands of young men fled the country or hid within Russia. Those who were called up then remain at the front, despite promises that they would serve for only six months. That has spawned a protest movement led by their wives and mothers called Voina Zaebala (Fucked off by the war). \u201cWe don\u2019t give birth for our children to be killed,\u201d complains an agitated mother in a video that has circulated widely on social media."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The police are searching energetically not only for draft-dodgers, but also for migrants from Central Asia, whom they seem to be press-ganging into military service.

There are often raids on student dormitories, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile the Duma, Russia\u2019s parliament, is preparing for more rounds of mobilisation. The maximum age subject to conscription has been raised from 27 to 30 years. The time former servicemen remain reservists has been extended by five years, to 60 in the case of junior officers. The law has been changed to require employers to turn in their staff for military service. As Andrei Kartopolov, chairman of the Duma\u2019s defence committee, explained, \u201cThis law was written for a big war, for a general mobilisation. And you can already smell that big war in the air.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "But a shortage of manpower is not the army\u2019s only problem. Aleksandr Golts, author of \u201cMilitary Reform and Militarism in Russia\u201d, argues that it is also short of junior officers, training capacity and equipment. The higher military spending is, in all likelihood, wildly inefficient. Russia\u2019s arms industry is notoriously corrupt: kickbacks are estimated by some to double the cost of procurement. It is also starved of skilled labour. Yuri Borisov, the deputy prime minister, says it needs another 400,000 engineers, IT specialists and managers."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20231202_FBD002.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is talk of increasing state control over the economy, to abet the war effort.

Eighteen big companies have been nationalised in 2023, many of them in the name of restoring looted property to the state.

New history textbooks explain to pupils that Russia has always been and will always be in a state of war with the West. This narrative allows Mr Putin to depict everyday activities as a triumph. \u201cEnabling Russian companies to successfully tap the market is a victory\u2026Building cutting-edge factories and kilometres of new roads is a victory\u2026Scientific discoveries and new technologies\u2014these are also victories,\u201d he boasted in a speech on the anniversary of the invasion."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such talk hints at the contradiction at the heart of Mr Putin\u2019s approach to the war. He wants both to mobilise ever more manpower and money for the fight and at the same time to secure Russians\u2019 acquiescence by disrupting their lives as little as possible. As ever more power and resources are redistributed within Russia, this contradiction will become even more glaring. His regime\u2019s wobbliest moment yet came in June, when bickering between the army and Wagner, a mercenary group led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close friend of Mr Putin, escalated into outright mutiny. Although Mr Prigozhin quickly backed down and later died in a convenient plane crash, it was a reminder that it is not easy to balance the competing interests within Russia\u2019s elite. As economic dislocation increases and resources get more scarce, those conflicts will only grow. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 12}
