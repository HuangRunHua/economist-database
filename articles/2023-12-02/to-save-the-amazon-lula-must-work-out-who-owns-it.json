Scientists fear it may hit a tipping-point when 25% has gone: the sky river may fail and the forest will no longer be able to sustain itself. That would be a global catastrophe. So reducing the pace of deforestation, though welcome, is not enough. The chainsaws are still biting: 3,700 km2 (1,400 square miles) of Brazil\u2019s rainforest vanished in the first eight months of 2023.

But most of all he must grapple with a systemic problem: lawlessness. Brazil has many sensible federal rules to protect the rainforest, but they are woefully enforced. In areas that rely on mining, ranching or farming to put food on the table, state and local officials often quietly overlook environmental crimes, or issue permits for illicit activities.

He is probably wrong\u2014but he may have convinced himself that he is right. In the Amazon, even the basic question of who owns what is maddeningly unclear. At least 22 federal and other government agencies can register land claims. These agencies \u201cdon\u2019t really talk to each other\u201d, says Brenda Brito of Imazon, an NGO.

In a recent report, the World Bank cites a number of distortions that make it harder. One is \u201cundesignated land\u201d. Roughly 42% of the Brazilian Amazon is classified either as a protected area or as an indigenous reserve. Another 29% is privately owned, with owners required to conserve 80% of the forest on their land. However 29% (1.2m km2, or almost twice the area of Texas) is \u201cundesignated\u201d, meaning it is public land but has not been confirmed as a reserve or designated for any other purpose. Such lands are \u201cthe main deforestation hotspots\u201d, says the bank. Some 116,000 km2 of undesignated terrain had been claimed as private property as of 2020, though this is not legal. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Land tenure is weak more or less everywhere in the rainforest. Private owners often lack title deeds, even for land the government designated to them back in the 1970s (when it was a military dictatorship). This makes it tougher to enforce environmental laws, since it is often unclear who is responsible for a given slice of forest. It also invites land-grabbers to use brute force. At least 47 people were killed in rural clashes in 2022, according to the Pastoral Land Commission, another NGO."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another distortion is a perverse system of taxes and handouts. A complicated land tax called the ITR is easy to cheat and encourages farmers to cultivate more of their land than they otherwise would, even if that means clearing forest. Farm subsidies are smaller in Brazil than in many other countries, at 0.35% of GDP, but go disproportionately to cattle ranchers in the Amazon. World Bank number-crunchers have shown that the more forested a state is, the higher the share of credit subsidies that goes to cattle-farmers. Such handouts make farmland more valuable, and so offer an incentive for people to create more of it by slashing and burning the forest.

Even the federal government charged only 26%, according to a paper by Dr Brito and others. The state of Tocantins sold land that year for an average of about $1 a hectare, when it was worth more than $2,000. In the past, people who have illegally occupied land have been allowed, after a number of years, to obtain formal title at giveaway rates like these. This encourages small-time squatters and big ranchers to move onto unclaimed or thinly populated land, in the hope that the state will let them buy it cheaply. Many officials in the Amazon approve.

Certainly, supermarkets in Europe are wary of Brazilian beef. But most of it is sold in Brazil, where the illicit variety is easy to launder.

Marina Silva, his environment minister, says the first step is to study all the undesignated land and work out which parts should be indigenous reserves or conservation areas.

Some 30,000 km2 are on the verge of being designated, she says, and another 68,000 km2 are being evaluated. Since January Lula has issued decrees recognising eight indigenous reserves.

The Supreme Court ruled this clause unconstitutional, and Lula vetoed it. But Congress may yet overturn his veto. The politicians blocking reform are responding to economic forces.
