Even in Germany, land of harmonious relations between workers and bosses, the powerful metalworkers\u2019 union, IG Metall, has no say at the company\u2019s local plant in Gr\u00fcnheide, near Berlin. Mr Musk\u2019s latest challenge\u2014a strike by some 130 mechanics at ten Tesla service workshops in Sweden\u2014looks like a trifle. But it may yet prove consequential."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Swedish strikers are members of IF Metall, which represents the country\u2019s metalworkers. They downed tools on October 27th, demanding collective-bargaining rights. Mr Musk ignored them at first. That dismissive stance became harder to maintain as other workers joined them in sympathy strikes. Postal workers refused to deliver licence plates for Tesla cars, dockers to unload Teslas from ships and cleaners to scrub the firm\u2019s showrooms. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On November 27th Tesla filed lawsuits against the Swedish Transport Agency and the national postal service over their workers\u2019 refusal to deliver licence plates for its cars. On the same day the court ruled that Tesla would be allowed to collect the plates directly from the transport agency\u2019s offices. But the strike continues. IF Metall vows to pay the strikers\u2019 wages for months, even years, if that is what it takes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cMy guess is that the Swedish unions will win,\u201d predicts Jesper Hamark of the University of Gothenburg. For IF Metall this is a much bigger fight than a walkout by 130 car mechanics. The union does not want to set a precedent that could inspire other companies to operate in Sweden without accepting collective bargaining. Today around 90% of workers in Sweden are covered by such agreements; 69% are union members."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A face-saving solution for Mr Musk could be to set up a Swedish subsidiary under a different name that would run the workshops and allow collective bargaining. Tesla\u2019s bigger worry is that the plucky Swedes embolden workers at its German factory, which manufactures 60% of Teslas sold in Europe. That share is likely to increase should European countries impose tariffs on electric cars from China, where the remaining 40% currently come from. To serve Europe\u2019s growing EV market, the world\u2019s second-biggest behind China, Tesla plans to double its German workforce from around 11,000 to 22,500. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Sweden is encouraging for us,\u201d says Markus Sievers of IG Metall. Swedish comrades\u2019 fight for better working conditions is its fight, the German union has declared. It claims that Tesla\u2019s German workers are paid a fifth less than those at carmakers covered by the industry\u2019s collective wage agreement. And it has already set up an office near Gr\u00fcnheide to win Tesla employees over. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 52}
