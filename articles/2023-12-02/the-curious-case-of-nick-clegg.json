There, a little before \u201cclematis\u201d and \u201cclemency\u201d, you will find the entry \u201cCleggmania\u201d (NOUN, informal). Its definition is \u201cthe brief surge in popularity for the leader of the Liberal Democrat party, Nick Clegg\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Nick is a funny mixture. He feels both very successful (he has his own dictionary entry) and not that successful (read it). He charms many people (see \u201c-mania\u201d, not to mention its cognate, \u201cCleggstasy\u201d) but irritates others (the surge was, after all, \u201cbrief\u201d). Before he led the Liberal Democrats into a coalition government with the Conservatives in 2010 he was so popular that T-shirts were printed bearing the logo \u201cI agree with Nick\u201d. After it he became so unpopular that the T-shirts vanished and a mocking song about a policy U-turn on tuition fees appeared in their place. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In person he offers that same odd blend. His anecdotes are peopled by bigwigs from both sides of the pond. \u201cJohn\u201d (Major) offers avuncular advice; \u201cSheryl\u201d (Sandberg) rings while he is on holiday; \u201cMark\u201d (Zuckerberg) is a close colleague. But what he talks about most is not success but failure\u2014of his \u201ccatastrophic\u201d loss in the 2015 election, when his party slumped from 57 seats to eight (he lost his own job as an MP in 2017); of his \u201cterrible\u201d defeat; of looking disaster \u201csquarely in the face\u201d. All political careers end in failure. Few ex-politicians talk about it as openly as he does."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet he is clearly not a failure. Look at the \u201cExecutives\u201d page of Meta\u2019s website, and you find him near the top, with the title \u201cPresident, Global Affairs\u201d. Most of the other executives look like superannuated students; Sir Nick wears a grown-up, collared shirt. In both clothes (in an interview in the Meta offices in London, then on Zoom, he wears similarly sensible things) and manner (he is one of those rare, appealing sorts who doesn\u2019t merely speak but listens), he feels less like an international whizz and more like someone\u2019s nice dad. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Which, you suspect, is why Meta wanted him\u2014and why he bothers people. Many politicians (and tech bros) are so odd that they are beyond envy; Sir Nick seems a superior sort of everyman. Which means that every man can look at him, feel envious and ask: what does he have that they don\u2019t? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One answer is a phone call from Ms Sandberg in 2018. Facebook (as it was then) was leaving behind its adolescent beanbag-and-ballpit phase and entering some very grown-up controversies about everything from the disruption of democracy to worsening mental health. Mr Zuckerberg went from being \u201chero to villain in the blink of an eye\u201d, says Sir Nick, but being a \u201crelatively sort of introverted\u201d engineer type wasn\u2019t entirely ready to cope. Sir Nick was familiar with ebbs and flows in popularity. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He was on holiday in Switzerland with his sons when Ms Sandberg, then the firm\u2019s chief operating officer, asked if he wanted to work at Facebook. He promptly said: \u201cNo. Not on your nelly. Absolutely not.\u201d Not for ideological reasons, he says, but because \u201cI just couldn\u2019t imagine decamping the whole family to California.\u201d She persisted; he wavered. It was a good time for a change. He had lost his seat in Parliament, his family seemed keen to go (though they are now back in Britain) and he had an appetite to try something completely new. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It helped that Britain\u2014which by 2018 had voted to leave the EU\u2014was much less appealing. He describes himself as \u201cEuropean\u201d, which might sound like an affectation but is almost an understatement. His mother is Dutch, his father is half-Russian, his wife is Spanish and he speaks five languages. He loathed the \u201cswivel-eyed\u201d populism that led to Brexit and had no desire, at 50, to rot away in the House of Lords (\u201ca truly absurd institution\u201d) or, the modern equivalent, to produce political podcasts. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In joining Meta, however, Sir Nick was plainly not after the easy life. For there are actually two reasons people are bothered by him. The first critique sees him as not quite good enough to do all that he does: an ordinaryish man enjoying extraordinary success. The second is that he is too good to do what he does, that he is a moral man who makes compromises\u2014first in coalition with the Tories, then inside Meta\u2014and himself becomes compromised. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Nick himself says that he has always liked \u201dgetting my hands dirty on difficult issues, difficult dilemmas\u201d. The most obvious such issue in Meta was over whether to suspend Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram in 2021. \u201cAs an old-fashioned liberal I felt pretty queasy about it. Because we are a private-sector company wielding immense power over speech in the public realm.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "If such decisions are hard, one benefit of his previous career is that everything else feels easier. Leaving politics, he says, had been \u201chugely liberating\u201d. He did things that he hadn\u2019t done for years: going to the theatre, listening to music, bingewatching TV. He felt like \u201ca pot plant that was suddenly being\u2026properly watered again\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The schedule in politics had been punishing, the sheer volume of reading overwhelming. Politicians are \u201cforce-fed\u201d information from the civil service like \u201cproducing the political equivalent of foie gras\u201d. When various \u201cNick Clegg looks tired\u201d memes were doing the rounds, he had pneumonia. If people ask him now what is needed for a career in politics, he says: \u201cPure physical resilience.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "After the election in 2015 Sir John Major warned him that it would take \u201cat least two years\u201d to recover. Arguably, despite all Sir Nick\u2019s subsequent success, it took longer. \u201cIt was by a long, long way the most sudden, brutal and public failure that I\u2019ve ever had to endure. I actually wouldn\u2019t wish it lightly on any of my erstwhile opponents.\u201d A nice sentiment. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
