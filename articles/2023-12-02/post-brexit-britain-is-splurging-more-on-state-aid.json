Figures on the Thatcherite right imagined a smaller state of low taxes and lower subsidies. The Eurosceptic left hoped that junking the EU\u2019s state-aid rulebook would allow the government to back favoured industries. Things are not going the Thatcherites\u2019 way. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Brexit has coincided with a dramatic rise in the use of government aid to businesses, according to a new analysis commissioned by The Economist from Shearman &amp; Sterling, a law firm. In 2015 British government aid amounted to 0.35% of GDP, compared with an EU-wide average of 0.67%. That surged to 2.71% in Britain and 2.39% in the EU in 2020, as covid-19 prompted bail-outs of stricken firms.

In the EU the commission must vet the largest subsidies before they are given. In Britain the regulator\u2019s advice to the government is non-binding; cash awards can be clawed back only after the fact by a court. Historically Britain was a frugal user of state aid.
