Cars and the extensive road network in America have always been about culture as well as mobility. Principles such as freedom, independence and autonomy are reflected in the scale, character and abundance of the infrastructure. Unlike much of Europe, where small cars were designed to accommodate intimate existing streets, America paved its roads and later built its communities around cars. Americans drive larger vehicles than the rest of the world, in part because wide American roads allow for such largesse. With their disjointed urban design, American suburbs can be characterised as a space without place. Roads and the associated infrastructure, such as large shopping malls, calcify a car lifestyle."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The self-driving revolution will have an impact on this culture, especially in the North American suburb. Make the car do the driving and the expanded cabin space has significant implications for the behaviour of drivers, who will be free to work, play and perhaps enjoy a drive-through meal with a knife and fork in their cars. In an autonomous-burb, cars will function more like small buildings on the move. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This will have profound implications on the suburban cultural landscape that should be considered alongside the development of self-driving technology itself.

Urban planners from across the country frequently sought his consultation, and his vision of a city that was traversable by cars, criss-crossed by roads and highways and parkways ultimately influenced the designs of countless others."}, {"role": "body", "text": "AUBREY PERONANew York"}, {"role": "body", "text": "I was surprised that your article disregarded the basic externalities of cars. The lower housing costs of the suburbs are achieved at great personal cost, both in terms of the dollars that go towards owning and operating a car and because of the cost of time. You neglected the burden that America\u2019s car addiction places on individuals, particularly those on low incomes. On average, car expenses stack up to $1,000 a month. That is a huge cost for most families\u2019 budgets. The farther out you live the more likely you are to own more than one car. Our car-driving landscape often makes that cost unavoidable (going to a supermarket for example). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then there are the environmental costs, in terms of air and water pollution, that our car dependence creates.

This deficit in supply caused prices to rise to the point that people can no longer afford to live there. Moreover, our roads may be 27% faster than our foreign counterparts, but our cities are 72% larger. This road infrastructure also comes at a direct expense to every other form of transportation. Rail, bus, biking and walking all require a certain degree of density that is incompatible with suburbia. And while the average American household may have two cars, what does that mean for those who can\u2019t afford the car payment, taxes, gas, and insurance that comes with owning a car?
