Oneworld, which published it in Britain, employs 25 people and is led by Novin Doostdar and Juliet Mabey, a husband-and-wife team. In addition to this year\u2019s prize, the independent firm published Booker winners in 2015 (by Marlon James) and 2016 (Paul Beatty). In America \u201cProphet Song\u201d is published by Grove Atlantic, another independent, with a staff of 30."}, {"role": "body", "text": "These houses are tiny compared with the juggernauts that dominate the book trade. The world\u2019s largest publisher, Penguin Random House (PRH), employs 10,000 people. PRH, along with HarperCollins, Hachette and Macmillan\u2014known as the \u201cBig Four\u201d\u2014account for 51% of sales in Britain.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "But a large staff and large budgets do not always translate into quality. When it comes to the world\u2019s most important literary prizes, small publishers are outperforming bigger ones. Last year\u2019s Booker prize went to \u201cThe Seven Moons of Maali Almeida\u201d by Shehan Karunatilaka, which had been rejected by larger publishers before being issued by Sort of Books in Britain and W.W. Norton in America. American indies also published Booker prizewinners in 2019, 2020 and 2021. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Independently published books have done particularly well with the Nobel. This year\u2019s laureate, Jon Fosse, is published in America by Transit Books, a minuscule outfit. (Its headquarters are the publishers\u2019 home, making it literally a \u201cpublishing house\u201d.) Last year\u2019s Nobelist, Annie Ernaux, is published by Seven Stories in America, which has a dozen full-time employees. Mr Fosse and Ms Ernaux are both published in Britain by Fitzcarraldo Editions, perhaps the pre-eminent small press, which has issued books by four of the past nine Nobel laureates. Its team is made up of seven people."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What is the secret to big success for small presses? Nothing new, the editors say, but rather something as old as the book trade: picking worthy titles, editing them carefully and promoting them well. It often comes down to money\u2014in particular, not thinking too much about it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Big publishers have to produce quarterly profits for shareholders, which means they need commercial titles that will reliably sell. (That means celebrity memoirs, pulpy romance novels and predictable action thrillers.) They strive to post ever higher returns: in 2021 Simon &amp; Schuster boasted a 21.4% profit margin.

Financial considerations are \u201conly one of the factors involved in selecting books\u201d, says Morgan Entrekin of Grove Atlantic. He describes his firm\u2014whose rich back catalogue includes works by Samuel Beckett and Jack Kerouac, among others\u2014as a \u201cnot for loss\u201d business.

Good books, if they are taught in schools, can sell for years and make a profit in the long term. Prizes provide another lift. \u201cThe Seven Moons of Maali Almeida\u201d has sold roughly 20 times more copies than Mr Karunatilaka\u2019s other novel."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indie companies are willing to take chances on authors whom bigger publishers consider too risky. Mr Entrekin bought the American rights for Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d after corporate publishers dropped the mid-career novelist. (It won the Booker in 2019.) Independents are also willing to stick with authors who may be writing well but selling modestly, publishing the third and fourth novels that may lead, as in Mr Lynch\u2019s case, to a prizewinning fifth. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Publishing is, by its nature, a gamble. The recent renaissance of independent presses may fade with the changing tastes of prize committees or the fickle fancies of readers. \u201cSometimes you catch a thermal,\u201d Ms Mabey says, and a book soars. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t.\u201d But small publishers can adapt to changing winds.
