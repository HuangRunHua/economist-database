Chinese authorities tolerated this \u201cDemocracy Wall\u201d at first. But they soon clamped down. A curious inversion of this episode unfolded in London around August 6th when Chinese art students daubed Communist Party slogans on a wall in Brick Lane, a street famed for its curry houses and arts scene. Spray-painted in bright red paint against a white background were 24 large Chinese characters outlining the party\u2019s 12 \u201ccore socialist values\u201d. They included \u201charmony\u201d, \u201cpatriotism\u201d and \u201crule of law\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The slogans are widely displayed across China as part of a campaign launched by its supreme leader, Xi Jinping, to popularise party ideals. But they are rarely seen abroad. Their sudden appearance in Brick Lane sparked an immediate backlash\u2013including from many Chinese. Within hours, the slogans were covered in more graffiti. The word \u201cno\u201d was added before the Chinese characters for \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d. Above the word \u201cequality\u201d, someone wrote \u201cBut some are more equal than others.\u201d Others decried the Chinese government\u2019s recent crackdowns in Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Images of the wall soon spread on Chinese social media, triggering debate. Some nationalists hailed the artists as patriots while others suggested they had conceived an indirect form of protest, knowing the slogans would be defaced. The artists themselves added to the confusion. In a printed statement on the wall, they said their work was \u201ca silent reminder\u201d of the lack of free speech in China. But on Instagram, one suggested the aim was \u201cto decolonize the false freedom of the West\u201d. He later denied any political intent and expressed concern for his family\u2019s safety."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Tower Hamlets, the London council that oversees Brick Lane, said it removed the graffiti after being alerted by security-camera operators. It warned that graffiti were punishable with fines starting from \u00a380 ($102). The Democracy Wall protesters did not get off so lightly. Their figurehead, Wei Jingsheng, was jailed for almost 15 years.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 19}
