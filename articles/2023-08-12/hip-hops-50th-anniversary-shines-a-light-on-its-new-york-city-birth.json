He repeated instrumental breaks to lengthen the most danceable part of songs. The \u201cbreak\u201d dancers became known as b-boys and b-girls. A friend, Coke La Rock, hyped up the crowd. It was not called hip-hop yet, but that \u201cjam\u201d is widely recognised as the start of a culture and society-changing type of music that became more than just a genre."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Bronx was the centre of the new movement. DJs played on the city\u2019s streets and in its parks, siphoning electricity from lamp-posts to pump up the volume.

Before he was even a teenager, Grandmaster Wizzard Theodore invented record \u201cscratching\u201d. Most songs were party anthems until Melle Mel\u2019s \u201cthe Message\u201d, hip-hop\u2019s first socially conscious song and one of the best hip-hop singles ever.

At first the MC (master of ceremonies) amped the crowd, but eventually took centre-stage with rhymes and witty lyrics. The b-boys and b-girls popped and locked during the DJ\u2019s breaks. Modern graffiti, which began in Philadelphia, became an art form in New York City. Eric Felisbret, author of \u201cGraffiti New York\u201d, says that graffiti is often the \u201cstepchild\u201d of hip-hop, probably because it was difficult to commodify.
