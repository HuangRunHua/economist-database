At least that is how his neglectful mother and a farmhand on his parents\u2019 Irish estate recalled it. Wrong, insists Mr Macarthur: he tripped and fell on a rock.

As the disputed horse-kick shows, he is careful to separate fact from rumour or surmise. His is a scrupulous, thoughtful work in the ubiquitous, often ghoulish genre of true crime. Yet despite his exacting standards, or because of them, readers may reach a harsher verdict on the genre itself."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The modern true-crime fad is generally traced to \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d, Truman Capote\u2019s landmark, fabrication-riddled book of 1966; but the idea can be tracked through Victorian \u201cpenny dreadfuls\u201d to early-modern murder ballads and beyond. In the 21st century it has been supercharged by cable television, streaming and podcasts, the bingeable formats fitting the suspenseful narratives like a felon\u2019s glove.

A bow-tied dilettante with academic airs, he resolved to rob a bank and so preserve his \u201clanguid liberty\u201d. While stealing a getaway car and a gun, he needlessly killed Bridie Gargan, a nurse, and Donal Dunne, a farmer. He was caught in the home of a pal\u2014Patrick Connolly, Ireland\u2019s attorney-general.

Mr O\u2019Connell tracked him down on the streets of Dublin and weaves together an account of the murders, a chronicle of his talks with the killer and his own reflections. It is not only factual rigour that distinguishes his book from many true-crime tales on page and screen. He is respectful of the horror at its heart, eschewing cliffhangers and gore, and is straight with Mr Macarthur about his plans\u2014rebutting Janet Malcolm\u2019s famous claim in \u201cThe Journalist and the Murderer\u201d that, because they deceive their subjects, the work of reporters like him is \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d.

More commonly it risks distressing victims\u2019 relatives (who, as here, often decline to speak to writers or producers). It blurs reality with fiction, not least among the amateur sleuths and vigilantes who obstruct some police inquiries. It services, but never satiates, grisly instincts of Schadenfreude and prurience. Bending the mess of life to fit the arc of a character or an episode, it mines suffering for entertainment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For all the author\u2019s tact, Mr Macarthur does not give him what he wants, at vital moments retreating into creepily impersonal evasions (he refers to his murders as \u201cthe criminal episode\u201d).
