Three forces are pushing the region to become this century\u2019s commodity superpower. The green transition is increasing demand for metals and minerals that Latin America has in large supply, as well as the renewable energy to process them. The region already supplies more than a third of the world\u2019s copper, used in wiring and wind turbines, and half of its silver, a component of solar panels. Its fertile land produces enough grain, animals, coffee and sugar to help feed a growing global population. And lastly, geopolitical tensions between the United States and China are causing countries to look fondly upon investing in a relatively neutral region. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Latin America\u2019s experience with raw materials is as chequered as it is long. Argentina owes its name to the Latin for the silver shipped from its ports after it was extracted by conquistadors in Bolivia and Peru; Brazil\u2019s descends from the brazilwood tree, exploited by Europeans in the 16th century. The countries\u2019 vast riches subsequently helped spark coups, populist takeovers, crime and corruption.

By contrast, the energy transition is global and requires investment over decades. Low-carbon technologies are much hungrier for minerals than their dirtier equivalents.

But that is elusive. It is not just the fiery rhetoric of the raft of left-wingers and nationalists in Latin America that is causing jitters. Governments are looking to get more value from their materials by imposing more rules. In May Chile voted to raise the top tax rate on copper miners from 41-44% to nearly 47%, among the highest in the world. SQM paid fully 60% of its profits to the state in 2022.

Buoyed by current-account surpluses, domestic currencies appreciate, making non-commodity exports less competitive. Labour and capital flow to extractive industries, depriving others of scarce resources. Both make the domestic economy more dependent on a volatile sector. Following the end of the most recent commodities boom in 2013, regional economies grew at an average annual rate of only around 1% compared with 4.1% in the decade before. Swings in commodity prices loom: the green transition is likely to advance in fits and starts, and geopolitical rifts can stem exports overnight."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Tools exist to mitigate such threats. Central banks can intervene in foreign-exchange markets to keep a lid on the currency. Exporters can hedge against price fluctuations by buying futures and options on derivatives markets. Smart fiscal rules can dictate that a share of proceeds be saved when prices are high. Yet governments in the region are more focused on grabbing a share of the proceeds than on planning for the risks. Many lack the technocratic nous to implement fixes. Fiscal rules are often ignored. Only six countries have non-partisan public-finance watchdogs. Save for Chile\u2019s, Latin America\u2019s 24 sovereign funds lack serious guardrails against raids by governments.
