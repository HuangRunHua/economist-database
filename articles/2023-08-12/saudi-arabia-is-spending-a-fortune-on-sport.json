Last season\u2019s tournament did not exactly set pulses racing. Just 9,300 fans attended games on average. For three of the past five seasons the top scorer has been Abderrazak Hamdallah, a Moroccan who has not played for any of the world\u2019s top clubs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But this season may be different. Mr Hamdallah\u2019s team, Al Ittihad, has just signed Karim Benzema, winner of the 2022 Ballon d\u2019Or award for best player in the world, from Real Madrid, and N\u2019Golo Kante, a star midfielder from Chelsea. Cristiano Ronaldo, a five-time winner of the Ballon d\u2019Or, moved to Al Nassr, another Saudi club, in January from Manchester United. Former Liverpool winger, Sadio Man\u00e9, joined him there, while Liverpool\u2019s captain, Jordan Henderson, signed for Al Ettifaq. The list goes on. Teams in the Saudi league have spent more than $480m on fees this summer, catapulting them among the biggest spenders in global football. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Pro League\u2019s moves are just one part of a multi-billion dollar push by Saudi Arabia into global sports, backed by Muhammad bin Salman, known as mbs, the country\u2019s crown prince and de facto ruler. It goes far beyond football and is roiling global golf, Formula 1 motor racing, boxing and more. mbs\u2019s ambition is to use sport to modernise Saudi Arabia, and to transform the outside world\u2019s perception of the desert kingdom of 36m people. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Saudi splurge is happening just as the global sports industry is being shaken by digital disruption and a new wave of private-equity investment. Cynics accuse mbs of vanity projects and \u201csportswashing\u201d\u2014using sport to whitewash the country\u2019s reputation for human-rights abuses. Saudi officials bridle at such criticism. Fahad Nazer of the Saudi embassy in Washington, dc, says the idea that the country is sportswashing \u201ccould not be further from the truth\u201d. He says such claims reek of \u201cethnocentricity\u201d: everything has been done with Saudi Arabia and its citizens\u2014not Westerners\u2014in mind, he says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many observers believe the moves will change not just Saudi Arabia, but global sport itself, wresting the initiative from stuffy Western guardians of teams and tournaments and introducing a dynamic new force. The spending has been going on for several years but until recently its full scope was obscured by a scatter-gun approach. Investments and negotiations have taken place in multiple layers of the sports industry, including buying players, purchasing foreign clubs, developing domestic clubs and buying or developing tournaments at home and abroad. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These deals have been pursued by a squad of Saudi entities including the government itself, the Public Investment Fund (pif), a sovereign wealth fund, and even Saudi Aramco, the oil firm that is the world\u2019s most profitable company. The scope is impressive, with at least $10bn spent across half a dozen major sports.

As well as developing its domestic league, there is intense speculation that Saudi Arabia will launch a bid to host the World Cup, perhaps in 2030, following in the footsteps of neighbouring Qatar in 2022. Gulf money is thought to have supported a 2021 attempt to create a European super league, which collapsed after opposition from fans.

Vanity and envy play a part. Many Saudi royals are fans. They have invested in teams elsewhere and now want some of their own. They also want to be taken seriously among the global sports elite. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the pif, is a golf nut. Documents released as part of recent congressional hearings into the pga Tour-liv deal suggest that one idea proposed as part of the transaction was that he might gain membership of Augusta, America\u2019s most exclusive club."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Saudis have watched as their neighbours have stepped up. The race began in 1993, says Danyel Reiche of Georgetown University in Qatar. That was when Qatar first hosted an atp men\u2019s tennis tournament (Boris Becker won). It spent $200bn preparing to host the 2022 World Cup. One of its royals also owns Paris St Germain, a top French club. Manchester City, owned by an Abu Dhabi royal, is now the world\u2019s most valuable football brand."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the Saudi plan goes far beyond perks for its elites and keeping up with the neighbours. Buoyant energy prices and production mean that its oil exports are expected to surpass $166bn this year, or 16% of gdp. With a global energy transition looming, the kingdom\u2019s \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan aims to diversify its economy away from oil by developing new industries and liberalising the economy, including by getting more women into the workforce. The pif is a key player, using its more than $700bn of funds to redeploy capital into new areas of the economy and make strategic investments in brands and technology."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The kingdom wants the Saudi Pro League to attract investment and fans. It aims to welcome 100m visitors a year by 2030 (there were 64m in 2021). Officials hope the league will quadruple its revenue to $480m by then, though that still pales beside, for instance, the epl, which generated ten times as much last year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sport, it is hoped, will have a spillover effect on the rest of the economy. Part of this is a rebranding exercise in a region known for religious strife, extremism and war. \u201cIt is better for everyone to be working together for prosperity in the region, not in conflict, and the Saudis want to be seen at the forefront of it,\u201d explains Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank in New York. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A better brand and more events can boost the tourism sector, which the government hopes will increase from 3% of gdp in 2019 to 10% in 2030. When you want to become a holiday hotspot, star-power helps: Lionel Messi, perhaps football\u2019s greatest player, is a Saudi tourism ambassador and posts sun-drenched snaps to his 482m followers on Instagram. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sport may even be useful as a mechanism to complement social reform. The Saudi government has in recent years become more accepting of the sexes mixing in public and has taken some steps to rein in its over-zealous religious police. Women were finally allowed to drive in 2018. Now it is backing women\u2019s sports as well as men\u2019s. The Saudi women\u2019s football team gained its first ranking from fifa in March. All of this may make the country more attractive to female tourists. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Across the region, hosting sports events has \u201cgenerally been positively perceived by residents,\u201d says Wadih Ishac, an assistant professor in sport management at Qatar University. Mr Nazer of the Saudi embassy in Washington points out that 70% of the Saudi population is under 35 and that young people love the sporting events. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The master plan faces two big risks. The first is that its business models may not work. Gulf owners can clearly run sports businesses well. Manchester City has thrived under its uae investor (though in February the epl accused it of allegedly breaking financial rules, a charge the club denies). During the first year of Saudi ownership, Newcastle United spent around \u00a3100m ($126m) and moved out of the relegation zone. In the second, the club came fourth, qualifying for the Champions League, Europe\u2019s main club competition, for the first time in 20 years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, within Saudi Arabia, sport is a state-backed, rather than an entrepreneurial, concern, with the problems that can entail. In June some top football clubs, previously under the control of the Ministry of Sports, were notionally privatised. But pif has a 75% stake in four teams. Aramco, the oil firm, has another team and neom, a metropolis being built in the desert, has one in the second division, too. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like football clubs have become quangos in Saudi Arabia,\u201d says Simon Chadwick of Skema Business School in Paris. Rather than a new dynamic engine of the economy, sports could become a manifestation of its old, state-run patronage system. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In order to attract stars, salaries must be huge. Mr Benzema reportedly signed a two-year contract worth $440m and Mr Ronaldo is rumoured to be earning $200m per year. Al Hilal this summer offered a record-smashing bid of \u20ac300m ($330m) to Paris St Germain for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, a French star, who so far has declined. Phil Mickelson, a golfer, pocketed $200m from liv Golf despite once describing the Saudis as \u201cscary motherfuckers\u201d (he later apologised). Colossal wage bills mean even the most successful European teams struggle to make money. Over half of the teams in the epl made losses in 2022, and overall the leagues in Italy, Germany and Spain are in the red. (Exor, which has a stake in The Economist\u2019s parent company, is also an investor in Juventus, an Italian football club, and Ferrari, an Italian carmaker.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Thanks to its oil wealth, the Saudi experiment will not break the bank. According to pif\u2019s annual report in 2021, leisure and entertainment accounted for just 1.6% of its assets. But the combination of low domestic revenues and high costs may mean many Saudi sports ventures cannot sustain themselves or compete globally without subsidies. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Saudi Arabia may face some of the same issues with football as China, which tried to raise the fortunes of its Chinese Super League in the past decade. Expensive imported stars may grumble about the standard of football and there will be plenty of scepticism about the sustainability of the current level of spending. But the state\u2019s backing for the league will negate the financial problems and political scrutiny which have hampered the Chinese project. The Saudis are also trying to attract younger talent, and not just be like the United States, where many top players from European clubs have traditionally gone to play out their twilight years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Saudi\u2019s smallish domestic audience may also impede its ambitions. There is an example of an emerging economy taking a dominant role in the business operations of a global sport. In 2008 India launched the Indian Premier League (ipl), a cricket tournament. Last year the rights to show matches over the next five years were sold for more than $6bn, making it the world\u2019s second-most lucrative sports league per game after the nfl, an American-football competition. India\u2019s financial clout has given it a powerful voice over cricket worldwide. But the foundation of India\u2019s success has been the sheer scale of the audience there, with 1.4bn cricket-mad citizens. Saudi cannot rival that."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230812_FBD002.jpg", "imageWidth": 1844.0, "imageHeight": 1139.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second big danger is that the surge triggers a backlash. Sport can be a sensitive industry in which to invest and Saudi Arabia\u2019s status as an autocratic state does not help.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is a new spin on an old idea, of nasty regimes using sports to show off their political models, as Mussolini did with the World Cup in 1934 and Hitler with the Olympics in 1936.
