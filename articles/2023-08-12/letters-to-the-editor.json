This misrepresents the process. The CPIB does not require the prime minister\u2019s permission for its investigations. It sought his concurrence before initiating a formal investigation of the minister for transport, S. Iswaran, because it involved a cabinet minister. The prime minister concurred within a day of receiving the director of CPIB\u2019s report."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No prime minister of Singapore has ever prevented the CPIB from investigating anyone. But even if the prime minister does not consent to CPIB investigations, under the constitution the director of the CPIB can still proceed with the investigations if he obtains the concurrence of the president. This is a constitutional provision unique among Westminster-style democracies. There are also safeguards for the appointment or removal of the director of the CPIB which require the concurrence of the president."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the case of two ministers renting state-owned bungalows in Ridout Road, it was the prime minister himself who asked the CPIB to investigate the matter. It conducted a thorough examination and found no evidence of wrongdoing or corruption. The Attorney General\u2019s Chambers (AGC) concurred with the finding."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The leader of the opposition accepted the CPIB\u2018s finding, stating in Parliament that he did not believe anybody was making an allegation that the ministers were corrupt. When the CPIB completes its investigation of Mr Iswaran, its findings will be submitted to the AGC, which will decide what to do with them. Such is the CPIB\u2018s fearsome reputation for thoroughness, few Singaporeans doubt its ability to see any case of corruption to its logical conclusion."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is why The Economist\u2019s charge that simply because the CPIB reports to the prime minister it can\u2019t be independent strikes many Singaporeans as deeply offensive and uninformed. Would The Economist suggest that the head of Scotland Yard is not independent because he is appointed on the advice of the home secretary, in consultation with the mayor of London?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If indeed the CPIB is so lacking in independence as The Economist makes out, how could it be possible that Singapore has consistently ranked high in Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index. In the latest 2022 index, Singapore was ranked fifth, behind only three Scandinavian countries and New Zealand, and ahead of every other Asian country. Britain was ranked 18th."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The prime minister, as well as his successor, Lawrence Wong, the deputy prime minister, are as determined as their predecessors were to investigate any case of corruption, no matter whom it involves, thoroughly and transparently.
