As the USS Harnett County, she became a base for river boats and helicopter gunships during the Vietnam war. Later as South Vietnam\u2019s My Tho, she carried refugees fleeing the fall of Saigon in 1975. Now a rusting hulk named the BRP Sierra Madre, she is serving in what may be her most celebrated role yet\u2014as a Philippine outpost defying mighty China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A small band of Philippine marines have been living in her carcass since 1999, when she was deliberately run aground on the Second Thomas Shoal, part of the Spratly \u201cislands\u201d around 200km from Palawan, the nearest big Philippine island. The point was to assert the Philippines\u2019 claim to the reef and portions of the South China Sea. For its part, China claims almost the entirety of the sea, and has built up several reefs into military bases. The Sierra Madre, though it sits more than 1,000km from China\u2019s Hainan, is a persistent thorn in its side, and a potential flashpoint for wider Sino-American rivalry."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On August 5th Chinese ships prevented Philippine boats from resupplying the Sierra Madre, not least by using water cannon. The Philippine government summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest against its \u201caggressive\u201d behaviour. China, which suspects that the ship is being repaired to ensure its longevity, accused the Philippines of having violated its sovereignty for the past 24 years and demanded the removal of the ship."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In doing so, China is disregarding a ruling made in 2016 by an international arbitration court, which dismissed most of its claims to \u201chistoric rights\u201d as invalid under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea. The Spratlys were not islands, it found, so could not generate exclusive economic zones. The Second Thomas Shoal lay within the Philippines\u2019 zone.

China\u2019s military build-up gives it a greater presence around disputed features such as rocks and atolls, notes Harrison Pr\u00e9tat of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, an American think-tank. The Philippines has become more vocal about China\u2019s bullying and has moved closer to America under President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. America is strengthening its various security accords with countries across the region."}, {"role": "body", "text": "America has warned China that \u201can armed attack on Philippine public vessels, aircraft, and armed forces\u201d\u2014including coastguard ships\u2014would trigger the mutual-defence treaty with the Philippines. What America intends to do is less clear. Its warships conduct \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d patrols to challenge Chinese claims. Its coastguard is training local forces in the western Pacific. Joint naval patrols with the Philippines are expected soon, but Ian Storey of the ISEAS-Yusof-Ishak institute in Singapore thinks they will probably be symbolic. China will be hoping that, if it prevents repairs long enough, the Sierra Madre will soon collapse into the reef. \u25a0"}], "id": 13}
