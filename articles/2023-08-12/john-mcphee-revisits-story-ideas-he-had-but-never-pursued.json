Attend the doctors\u2019 doctor, seek counsel from the lawyer other lawyers retain. So it goes with journalism. John McPhee, aged 92, is a writer\u2019s writer. A father of literary non-fiction, he has tackled subjects as varied as fishing and oranges in his 32 books and 60 years writing articles for the New Yorker. His book on geology, \u201cAnnals of the Former World\u201d, won the Pulitzer prize for non-fiction in 1999. (He has been a finalist for the prize four times.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cTabula Rasa\u201d, Mr McPhee\u2019s latest book, is different from what has come before. It is a compilation of the many \u201csaved-up, bypassed, intended pieces of writing\u201d he flirted with but did not pursue. At the outset, he compares the project to Mark Twain\u2019s autobiography, a series of anecdotes and ruminations dictated in his crepuscular years. Mr McPhee calls his and Twain\u2019s efforts \u201cold-people projects\u201d: attempts to fight mortality by tackling something that defies completion. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "As a young writer, he marvelled at this sort of quest, when Thornton Wilder, an older playwright who left Mr McPhee \u201cmoon-, star- and awestruck\u201d at a lunch meeting, described his latest venture. Wilder was cataloguing the 431 surviving plays of Lope de Vega, a Spanish playwright born in 1562. \u201cWhy would anyone want to do that?\u201d a perplexed Mr McPhee asked Wilder. Only now, later in life, does he understand: it was something \u201cto do, and do, and do. It beat dying. It was a project meant not to end.\u201d That is why Mr McPhee specifies that \u201cTabula Rasa\u201d is only \u201cvolume one\u201d. He is already working on the next instalment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Death appears many times in the book, often in the form of people\u2019s near-misses. At the age of 12, he tried to go ice skating with a young friend, Julian, but his mother forced him to attend church instead. Julian and a friend died that day: their corpses were found with their arms outstretched, frozen in place as they tried to climb out after the ice had shattered beneath them. For many years Mr McPhee tried to work out how to write about Julian, \u201cwhose future has remained beside me through all my extending past\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not all the almost-never-told stories are so sombre. In \u201cZoom Laude\u201d, Mr McPhee writes amusingly about his time teaching his writing course at Princeton at the start of covid-19, with his students forced to do their \u201cfree choice\u201d journalism assignments during lockdown. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Reading Mr McPhee\u2019s discarded ideas is both informative and personal, a bit like riffling through the waste bin at his desk. Younger journalists will enjoy his chapter on how he finally got started at the New Yorker, suffering 15 years of rejections before his first article was accepted. He evokes a bygone era of journalism, when businessmen, such as the publisher Henry Luce, were more accessible to the press. Contracts at magazines like the New Yorker specified that staff writers were simply expected to give their \u201cbest efforts\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cKill your darlings\u201d is an often-repeated admonition offered to aspiring writers: authors should cut the phrases and characters that delight them yet are not essential to making a point. Deciding which \u201cdarlings\u201d of story ideas should be killed off is rarely discussed when teaching writing, however, even though subject choice is surely the most important decision a writer can make. In \u201cTabula Rasa\u201d Mr McPhee demonstrates why ideas that animate writers often never lead to anything, perhaps wisely. But, as he explores what might have been, Mr McPhee also proves how enjoyable it can be to spend time with such an expert storyteller\u2014even on short journeys that never led anywhere. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 61}
