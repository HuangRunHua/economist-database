People strip off their clothes and flock to parks and swimming pools. And they buy ros\u00e9. According to Majestic, Britain\u2019s largest wine retailer, 26\u00b0C is the exact point at which sales of the pink stuff outpace those of red and white. During a heatwave last year, the company sold one bottle every 12 seconds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ros\u00e9 is the ultimate summer tipple. Like a strong, zesty margarita, a chilled glass of pale ros\u00e9 makes a perfect aperitif. (Unlike a margarita, you can probably enjoy more than two without disgracing yourself.) People have been drinking versions of ros\u00e9 wine for millennia, starting with the ancient Greeks. More than 2,000 years ago the ancient Romans started cultivating vineyards in Provence, in south-eastern France. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Provence remains ros\u00e9\u2019s heartland. With 35% of the output, France is the world\u2019s leading producer of ros\u00e9. It is also its leading consumer: a third of the bottles of wine drunk there are pink in colour. In the past 15 years, exports of Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 have increased by around 500%. Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Esclans sells an eye- and mouth-watering 10m bottles every year. LVMH, a luxury group that owns a number of revered champagne houses and wineries, has in recent years bought Ch\u00e2teau Galoupet and acquired stakes in Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Esclans and Ch\u00e2teau Minuty, ros\u00e9 juggernauts. In America, Whispering Angel, a pink wine produced by Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Esclans, sells the most bottles of any French wine of any hue. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Travel and social media help explain the wine\u2019s global spread. Before the pandemic, France was the world\u2019s leading tourist destination. The pale wine came to be seen as sophisticated thanks to glitzy events such as the Cannes Film Festival. Social-media tributes like #ros\u00e9allday (a celebration of day drinking) and #bros\u00e9 (a hashtag used by men who enjoy the wine) have brought attention to the drink. Consumers have also realised the wine\u2019s versatility, agreeing with Julia Child, a popular television cook, that \u201cros\u00e9 can be served with anything.\u201d Dry ros\u00e9s, pleasantly acidic and refreshing (unlike the cloying notes ros\u00e9 is infamous for, which are common in cheaper varieties), can accompany many cuisines well."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ros\u00e9 still remains a target of derision among oenophiles. It has earned the offensive moniker \u201cbitch diesel\u201d (so named because it is pink and has been marketed to women). According to Sacha Lichine, the president of Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Esclans, when he first approached potential distributors he would get the door slammed in his face: traditional folk \u201cthink that it\u2019s not a real wine. They think that it\u2019s a Coca-Cola wine,\u201d he explains. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Barbara Drew, a master of wine at Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, Britain\u2019s oldest wine merchant, suggests that the dismissal of ros\u00e9 as \u201cnot a serious wine\u201d is partly because it generally does not age as well as red, so is not of interest to some collectors and investors. But such squabbles over value ignore ros\u00e9\u2019s central role in summer culture.
