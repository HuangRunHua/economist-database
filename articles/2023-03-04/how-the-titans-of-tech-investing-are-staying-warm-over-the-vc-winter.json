Between 2012 and 2021 annual global investments grew roughly ten-fold, to $638bn.

Dealmaking turned frenetic. In 2021 Tiger Global inked almost one new deal a day. Across VC-dom activity \u201cwas a bit unhinged\u201d, says Roelof Botha, boss of Sequoia Capital, \u201cbut rational\u201d, given that low interest rates made money virtually free.

This group, which includes everyone from family offices and university endowments to industrial firms and pension funds, is growing nervy. And stingy: lower returns from their current investments leave LPs with less capital to redeploy, and collapsing stockmarkets have left many overallocated to private firms, whose valuations take longer to adjust and whose share of some LPs\u2019 portfolios thus suddenly exceeds their quotas.

All nine whales have been badly damaged by last year\u2019s crash. Sequoia\u2019s crossover fund, which invested in both public and private businesses, reportedly lost two-fifths of its value in 2022. Temasek\u2019s listed holdings on American exchanges shrank by about the same. SoftBank\u2019s mammoth Vision Funds, which together raised around $150bn, lost more than $60bn, wiping out their previous gains; in a sign of just how bad things were, its typically garrulous boss, Son Masayoshi, sat out the latest earnings call on February 7th. Tiger reportedly lost over half the value of its flagship fund and marked down its private investments by a quarter, torching $42bn in value and leading one VC grandee to speculate that it might turn itself into a family office.

In October Phillipe Laffont, Coatue\u2019s boss, said the hedge fund was holding 70-80% of its assets in cash. It has raised $2bn for its \u201ctactical solutions fund\u201d, designed to give mature startups access to debt and other resources, as an alternative to raising equity at diminished valuations.

Last April Andreessen Horowitz launched an \u201caccelerator\u201d programme to nurture startups.
