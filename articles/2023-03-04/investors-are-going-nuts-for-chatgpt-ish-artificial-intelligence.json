Not a week goes by without someone unveiling a \u201cgenerative\u201d artificial intelligence (AI) based on \u201cfoundation\u201d models\u2014the vast and complex algorithms that give ChatGPT and other AIs like it their wits. On February 24th Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, released a model called LLaMA. Elon Musk, boss of Tesla and Twitter, reportedly wants to create an AI that would be less \u201cwoke\u201d than ChatGPT. One catalogue, maintained by Ben Tossell, a British entrepreneur, has just grown to include, among others, Isaac Editor (which helps students write essays), Pickaxe (which analyses your own documents) and Ask Seneca (which answers questions based on the stoic philosopher\u2019s writings). ChatGPT may be much talked about and, with over 100m users, talked to. Yet Mr Tossell\u2019s database hints that the real action in generative AI is in all manner of less chatty services enabled by foundation models.

This allows them to interpret instructions in natural language and respond with text, art or music. Though such systems have been around for some time, it took a consumer-facing service such as ChatGPT to capture the world\u2019s\u2014and investors\u2019\u2014imagination. As Mike Volpi of Index Ventures, a venture-capital (VC) firm, says, this happened just as his fellow tech backers, burned by the cryptocurrency crash and the empty metaverse, were on the lookout for the next big thing. In addition, even more than web browsers and smartphones, foundation models make it easy to build new services and applications on top of them. \u201cYou can open your laptop, get an account and start interacting with the model,\u201d says Steve Loughlin of Accel, another VC firm.

In January it was reported that Microsoft poured $10bn in OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, on top of an earlier investment of $1bn. Pete Flint of NfX, another VC firm, now counts more than 500 generative-AI startups. They have so far collectively raised more than $11bn\u2014and that is excluding OpenAI (see chart). Mr Volpi talks of a \u201cCambrian explosion\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So which generative-AI platforms will make the big bucks? For now, this is the subject of head-scratching in tech circles. \u201cIt\u2019s just not clear if there will be a long-term, winner-take-all dynamic in generative AI,\u201d wrote Martin Casado and colleagues at Andreessen Horowitz, one more VC firm, in a recent blog post. Many startups offer me-too ideas, often more feature than product. Even the resource-intensive foundation models may end up as a low-margin commodity: though proprietary ones such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 are ahead, open-source alternatives aren\u2019t far behind.

The models often get things wrong. And they can go off the rails. Sydney, the chatbot Microsoft is developing for its Bing search engine using OpenAI\u2019s tech, has insulted a few users and professed its love to at least one (it has since been reined in). AI platforms may not enjoy the legal protection from liability that shields social media. Copyright holders of web-based content on which existing models are being trained without asking permission or paying compensation are up in arms. Getty Images, a repository of photographs, and individual artists have filed lawsuits against AI art-generators such as Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion says, \u201cWe take these matters seriously. We are reviewing the documents and will respond accordingly.\u201d News outlets fear text-gobbling AIs, too (see subsequent article).

It won\u2019t temper VC types\u2019 appetite for generative AI. For more risk-averse investors, the safest bet at the moment is on the providers of the ample processing power needed to train and run foundation models. The share price of Nvidia, which designs chips useful for AI applications, is up by 60% so far this year. Cloud-computing services and data-centre landlords are rubbing their hands, too. Whichever AI platform comes out top, you can\u2019t go wrong selling picks and shovels in a gold rush. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 49}
