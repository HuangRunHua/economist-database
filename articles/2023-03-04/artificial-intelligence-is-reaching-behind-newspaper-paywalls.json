On February 22nd it emerged that Google was blocking access to news content, in a five-week trial affecting about 4% of users in the country. The measure comes as Canada\u2019s Senate considers a bill that would force big internet companies to pay publishers for displaying links to their stories. Google says it may simply block them instead; Canada\u2019s government says the search engine\u2019s actions amount to intimidation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is the latest episode in a worldwide dispute between new media and old. News organisations, which in the past two decades have seen most of their advertising revenue disappear online, accuse search engines and social networks of profiting from content that is not theirs. Google and Facebook, which have come in for most of the flak, retort that they merely display links and a few lines of text, rather than articles themselves, and that by doing so they drive traffic to publishers (who in any case can opt out if they choose). Facebook estimates that it sends 1.9bn clicks a year to Canadian media, publicity it values at C$230m ($170m)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The online platforms\u2019 arguments have mostly fallen on deaf ears. Cheered on by their domestic press, governments in countries including Australia, Britain and Spain have passed or proposed laws aiming to squeeze money out of Silicon Valley and into local media companies. Australia\u2019s law, passed in 2021, prodded tech firms to make payments to Australian media reportedly worth about A$200m ($135m) in the scheme\u2019s first year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To ward off similar legislation elsewhere, Google and Facebook have set up mechanisms for funnelling \u201csupport\u201d to media companies. Google\u2019s \u201cNews Showcase\u201d will spend about $1bn in 2020-23 on licensing content from more than 2,000 news organisations in more than 20 countries. Facebook\u2019s News Tab (in which The Economist has participated) does something similar, but has lately been scaled back. Unlike Google, Facebook can live without news, which makes up only 3% of what users see in their feed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The laws have sometimes had the feel of a shakedown of the wealthy foreign tech firms by governments. But developments in the search business mean that the publishers\u2019 complaints seem increasingly justified. Search engines have been getting better at displaying information without referring visitors to external sources. Ask Google the size of Canada\u2019s population and it simply tells you that it was 38m in 2021 (followed by its usual list of suggested websites). About a quarter of desktop Google searches now end with no onward clicks, according to Semrush, an online marketing company."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve this capability dramatically. Google\u2019s AI helper, Bard, is still under wraps. But its rival, incorporated into Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine, is already resolving queries. Ask the old Bing for a summary of Canada\u2019s last election results and it points to sites including CBC News and the Globe and Mail. Ask the new Bing and it gives a decent account by itself (along with footnoted links to sources). AI assistants can even reach behind paywalls. A user trying to find the New York Times\u2019s recipe for macaroni and cheese will be stopped by a demand for payment and subscription. But ask Bing\u2019s AI and it serves up a paraphrased version of the whole recipe, complete with a licking-lips emoji."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The search companies admit they are still finding their way with new technology, which is mostly not yet on general release. That is unlikely to satisfy publishers\u2019 lawyers. The chief counsel at one large media company argues that AI-search companies should be made to license the content they regurgitate, just as Spotify has to pay record labels to play their songs. AI\u2019s use of others\u2019 material is \u201cthe copyright question of our times\u201d, he says. For years the complaints of publishers against platforms have rung somewhat hollow. Now they have a real story on their hands. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}]}
