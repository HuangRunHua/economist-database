Yet when Germany\u2019s Olaf Scholz arrives in Washington for talks with Joe Biden on March 3rd, it might not even count as the American president\u2019s most important contact with Europe that fortnight. During a trip to Poland last week, Mr Biden met leaders of the EU\u2019s eastern fringe, heaping praise on them for their help with the war in Ukraine, from which he had just returned. The sense that the war has rejigged the map of who matters in Europe was palpable."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The countries on the eastern fringe of the EU feel their time has come.

The war is an opportunity for fresh thinking and new leadership. \u201cThis is an existential moment for Europe as a whole,\u201d says Pawel Jablonski, a Polish deputy foreign minister.

Of course, Ukraine matters a great deal there as well: many billions are being spent on aiding the country, EU members\u2019 armed forces are being upgraded and the war has roiled the continent\u2019s economy.

In its view, the government is packing courts with politicised judges, and seeking to undermine the primacy of EU law.

Taken together, the Bucharest Nine have a population of 95m, around a fifth of the EU total; their combined GDP is only about a tenth of the EU\u2019s total at market rates.

More broadly, only in some fields are the interests of Romania aligned with those of Estonia, or those of Slovakia with Bulgaria. Extending the EU to Ukraine or the western Balkans would boost the figure, and the region\u2019s importance.
