The auditorium, filled with shareholders, analysts and media attending the firm\u2019s investor day at its headquarters on February 28th, stiffened."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The tense exchange reflects frustration inside Goldman. Mr Solomon can point to some success. Since he took over in 2018 the company has posted an annualised total return to shareholders of 13%\u2014better than the overall market and almost all of its competitors, apart from Morgan Stanley, its major rival, which managed to return 21% over the same period. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Solomon argues that this success is because the firm has followed through on promises made at its first-ever investor day three years ago, such as growing market share in investment banking, and beefing up assets under management. From this view, the critics\u2019 obsession with losses in platform solutions, which remains a tiny part of the firm, is unmerited. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the skirmish was also a sign of investors\u2019 frustrations. Although Goldman\u2019s core businesses have done well, it has been such a strange time for capital markets that it is hard to tell how much of the success can be replicated. The firm has struggled to lower the value of investments it makes using its own balance-sheet, which cause wild swings in earnings. Platform solutions may be a small part of the business, but costs are piling up. Losses doubled from 2021 to 2022, shaving two percentage points off returns on equity last year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At its investor day Goldman tried to reassure shareholders. This included a mea culpa from Mr Solomon, who said Goldman did \u201ctoo much too fast\u201d and grew into areas where it \u201cdid not have a competitive advantage\u201d. Fresh promises were also made. Stephanie Cohen, head of platform solutions, said scale would help the business reach profitability by 2025. Mr Solomon teased a sale, saying Goldman was exploring \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d. Later Bloomberg reported that the firm might sell GreenSky, a home-improvements lender it acquired only a year ago. These mixed messages\u2014vowing to grow the business and get rid of parts of it\u2014seem to have confused investors. The share price sagged. On a day when the s&amp;p 500 index of large American firms shed just 0.3%, shares in Goldman fell by nearly 4%.
