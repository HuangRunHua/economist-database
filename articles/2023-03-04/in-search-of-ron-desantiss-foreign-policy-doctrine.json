As far as we can tell. Maybe", "hashTag": "United States", "authorName": "The Economist", "publishDate": "2023-03-01T20:24:05Z", "contents": [{"role": "body", "text": "One sign of an impending presidential campaign is the appearance of a memoir marketed as a tell-all that, in fact, tells little. On February 28th Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, who many donors think is the party\u2019s best chance to thwart Donald Trump\u2019s re-run for the White House, gave his entry to that literary tradition when he published his book, \u201cThe Courage to Be Free\u201d. Mr DeSantis owes his status among Republican primary voters, who are torn (early opinion polls suggest) between him and the former president, to his bare-knuckled prosecution of domestic culture wars around the teaching of critical race theory, covid-19 lockdowns and censorship of conservatives on social media. But while an ambitious governor may concern himself only with a war on wokeness, a president must manage war."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Already, foreign diplomats in Washington have been scouring Mr DeSantis\u2019s scant public comments and past political record to guess how he would remake America\u2019s foreign affairs and trade relations. Some are cosying up to the Israelis, with whom Mr DeSantis has been close since his days as a congressman, in the hope that they have the scoop. The book might have helped fill in some gaps, they thought. Unfortunately for them, the queries will have to continue for a while longer. The book is not a deep meditation on international affairs but a positioning document for the bruising primary election to come\u2014offering only some clues and few details on how a President DeSantis might manage policy on China, Ukraine and trade."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Despite the book\u2019s title, Mr DeSantis does not yet have the courage to criticise Mr Trump, whom he praises lavishly throughout. Whereas the governor takes the time to disparage the \u201cmessianic impulse\u201d of the neoconservatives who dominated during the presidency of George W. Bush, the nationalism and protectionism of the Trump era earn warm praise. Mr DeSantis writes that, along with rightly building the wall on the Mexican border, Mr Trump \u201calso rightly ripped American failures at home, notably the outsourcing of manufacturing from our heartland to mainland China; and abroad, the endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Questionable moments like the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, or from the Paris climate accords, or the Doha Agreement in 2020\u2014which set into motion the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021\u2014are not discussed much and certainly not criticised. He takes some credit for Mr Trump\u2019s decision to relocate the embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, saying that the warnings about the cataclysmic consequences of doing this confirmed \u201cthe bankruptcy of our bureaucratic \u2018expert\u2019 class\u201d. (The rottenness of the deep state and the \u201cnational legacy press [that] is the praetorian guard of the nation\u2019s failed ruling class\u201d are recurring themes.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Foreign policy is of so little concern to American voters in the abstract that presidential candidates tend to describe their stances in domestic terms. Mr Trump wanted to return to an era when America was first, which meant slapping tariffs on allies and competitors alike and threatening to leave NATO. President Joe Biden\u2014who said that \u201cthere\u2019s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy\u201d\u2014has alternated between describing his ideas as a pedestrian \u201cforeign policy for the middle class\u201d or as a grand, existential contest between democracies and authoritarians. That framing, which annoys China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, is meant to evoke the shameful attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6th 2021. This is true of Mr DeSantis, too, who views America\u2019s foreign and domestic blunders as the result of the same phenomenon: a reliance on a decadent, globalist elite who \u201cembrace policies that ignore the importance of national sovereignty, favouring open borders and a \u2018global economy\u2019\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As a congressman, Mr DeSantis was a noted Russia hawk, who urged the Obama administration to provide lethal aid to the Ukrainians after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. As he contemplates a presidential run, Mr DeSantis is a critic of Mr Biden\u2019s \u201cblank-cheque\u201d policy on Ukraine which does not have a \u201cstrategic objective\u201d. This is not quite the same disengagement as that of Mr Trump, who now seems to want to cut support, but is out of line with the views of other mooted Republican contenders\u2014like Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo\u2014who are more staunchly supportive of Ukraine. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "While in Congress, Mr DeSantis voted to expedite the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade initiative launched by Barack Obama, which floundered. Now, in line with his party, Mr DeSantis is quiet about trade deals. Like almost all Republicans and most Democrats, he is hawkish on China and in 2021 signed legislation aimed at cracking-down on theft of corporate secrets and intellectual property in Florida."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr DeSantis is a shrewder politician than his pugilistic reputation may suggest. He has managed to appeal to all the factions of his party\u2014the MAGA diehards, the cosmopolitan donor class and the religious right\u2014by hewing to a strict policy of strategic ambiguity. Abortion is mentioned only in passing in his new book, for instance; January 6th, not at all."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although Mr Trump has been itching for a fight, searching for provocations in Mr DeSantis\u2019s public statements, the governor has refused to punch back. The other anticipated contenders for the nomination are also refraining from attacking Mr Trump, who remains popular with the base. Nikki Haley, a former governor and member of the Trump cabinet who has declared her candidacy, recently dodged a question on how she differed from her former boss. The Foreign Affairs essays on how the Florida governor\u2019s worldview differs from Trumpism can wait until after the nomination contest, it seems. Until then the placeholder DeSantis doctrine will be to say little and change the subject.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more coverage of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, visit our dedicated hub and follow along as we track shifts in his approval rating.
