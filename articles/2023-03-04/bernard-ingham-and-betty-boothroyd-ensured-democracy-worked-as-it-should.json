It is also home to a breed of folk who judge themselves tougher, blunter, more hard-working and more bloody-minded than the average Briton, and often this is true. Bernard Ingham and Betty Boothroyd, both natives of the industrial West Riding, might have come from Yorkshire central casting: she glamorous and loud, once described as a cross between a diva, a headmistress and a barmaid; he resembling the permanently narked referee of a small-town football match, with only his huge eyebrows to keep him from the nithering rain. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Both, however, followed the Yorkshire tradition of seeking fame and fortune in the soft south; and there, having climbed up patiently through the ranks, both forged stellar political careers. Mr Ingham became, in 1979, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s press officer, and thus\u2014because his boss took no interest in presenting policy, dealing with media or even reading the papers\u2014the chief explainer and defender of Thatcherism as it evolved. He stayed to the bitter end, and she said she could never have done without him. Miss Boothroyd became the first female Speaker of the House of Commons and the first elected since Parliament was regularly televised, serving from 1992 to 2000 and keeping her boisterous charges in better order than many men had managed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Both understood\u2014and would be stupid not to, Miss Boothroyd said\u2014that they were public performers. She began by declaring \u201cCall me Madam!\u201d and rejecting the Speaker\u2019s traditional long wig for her own perfectly good hair, to be comfortable. She designed her robes herself, gold Tudor roses on navy silk, to look the part. In a voice made deep and lovely by moorland water and 20 a day, she would cry: \u201cOrder! Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat immediately! Immediately! Immediately!\u201d When members wasted time she would yawn, or fan herself with her order paper, or, on one occasion, snap \u201cCome on, Mr ---! Spit it out!\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Ingham, too, relied on anger. His volcanic soul exploded regularly down the phone or at the twice-daily unattributable briefings he gave to the lobby, the band of journalists covering Parliament. Trick questions and attempted traps drove him mad. Conspiracy theories made him furious. They were \u201cBunkum and balderdash!\u201d \u201cA load of rubbish!\u201d or simply \u201cCodswallop!\u201d The least quiver of those eyebrows would send a thrill of fear through some reporters. Yet the crimson fury would subside quickly enough, with no grudges borne. He saved himself a deal of stress by insisting that all information given to the press went through him, not via random ministers and departments. Ministers grumbled about a power grab. He called it simple professionalism. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lurking behind these shows was plenty of human sympathy. Both performers knew what it was to struggle, whether to make a point in Parliament or to get a good story. Mr Ingham had worked from 16 on the Hebden Bridge Times and later the Yorkshire Post, covering perishing funerals and sodden agricultural shows, doggedly doorstepping for details of some tragedy. Even at the Guardian in the 1960s and 1970s he had felt unappreciated. Miss Boothroyd, once her ambitions rose beyond dancing with the Tiller Girls or window-dressing a draper\u2019s shop, contested four seats until she succeeded in 1973 in West Bromwich. Selectors and voters alike thought she stood no chance, as a woman, unless she was married, had children and peeled potatoes every day. She never married, instead treating her constituents as family for 27 years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mill-town unemployment had scarred both of them. They knew about poverty, and imbibed staunch Labour politics from their cloth-worker parents. Both joined the Labour Youth League and ran for council seats. This politics bug was like miner\u2019s coal-dust under her fingernails, said Miss Boothroyd; you couldn\u2019t scrub it out. It drove her into campaigning, in America for Kennedy as well as at home, and spurred Mr Ingham to make his way steadily up through the civil service in Whitehall. At different points both of them worked for Barbara Castle, a stalwart of mid-century Labour governments. But at the peak of their careers both took on jobs that, at least on paper, demanded impartiality. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This was far harder for Mr Ingham. He was not a political appointee, but a career civil servant who now found himself voicing the opinions of a most determined Conservative. And voice them he did, reading Thatcher\u2019s mind like a book. He explained it thus. First, she was his boss, to whom loyalty was owed. Second, she was another abrasive outsider, like himself. Third, her love of country inspired him. He had also soured on the trade unions, and thought her economic plans were worth at least a try. Lastly, it was time for Britons to rediscover good old-fashioned personal responsibility. As folk said in Hebden Bridge, they should \u201cbuckle to\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He also set strict rules. To the lobby he offered facts, not spin. Spin, to him, was a black art. He controlled the flow of stories, as was sensible. But he did not analyse, comment or influence policy, and only occasionally let slip something that undermined a minister, because Thatcher intended to. Those who thought him a tub-thumping Thatcherite, and many did, were mistaken. Facts were his watchword; as, in the House of Commons, parliamentary rules were for Miss Boothroyd. She too was accused of party favouritism, for Labour, when choosing whom to call. But all she cared to do, in the place she loved best in the world, was to impose on that unruly bunch the code of practice laid down in 1844 by Erskine May, with strictures of her own: no clapping, no pagers, no bad language. Between them, they kept democracy briskly flowing. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In retirement both remained bossy: she privately, upbraiding her successors by telephone, and he publicly, with increasingly intemperate columns in the Yorkshire Post and the Daily Express. His chief joy was his county, which he extolled in several books. In 2005 he included her in \u201cYorkshire Greats: The County\u2019s Fifty Finest\u201d. She was flattered to have been included among the few living subjects and the mere five women. She was less thrilled, though, to find herself keeping company with Guy Fawkes. \u25a0"}], "id": 74}
