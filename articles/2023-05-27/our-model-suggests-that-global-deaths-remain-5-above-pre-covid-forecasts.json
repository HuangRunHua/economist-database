However, excluding the recent surge in China, its best guess for the past year is around one of every 1m people per day. As a share of people aged at least 65, excess-death rates in rich countries are three times lower than elsewhere. But because such places have older populations, their overall mortality rate is similar."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Covid is not the sole cause of this change. Many countries\u2019 health-care systems remain strained, meaning people miss out on care. Cases of other diseases that went untreated in 2020-21 are raising death rates today.
