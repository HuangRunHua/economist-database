Since 2010 the NHS has done better than other departments but, save for a pandemic-related spike, the flow of money from central government has slowed (see chart 1). That has badly dented the finances of many NHS trusts, the organisational units which run health-care services. They balanced their books by raiding their capital budgets and by forgoing investment in medical equipment, buildings maintenance and digital records.

The underfunding has been most apparent in general practice, the first point of contact for most patients and the most cost-effective part of the system. \u201cGeneral practitioners are paid \u00a3160 per year per patient: that is less than it costs to insure a gerbil,\u201d points out James Morrow, a GP in Sawston, in Cambridgeshire.

At \u00a3160bn ($198bn) the annual budget the government gives NHS England to commission health services is already larger than the economies of all but four African countries.

But by the 2060s Britain\u2019s ageing population will resemble an ice-cream cornet rather than a pyramid. A narrowing cone of younger people, rather than a broad base, would not be able to provide that amount of labour and taxes. Resources are already being wasted. A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, found last year that, despite getting more money and more staff, the NHS is less productive than it was before the pandemic.

Last September minutes leaked from a secret meeting between the chiefs of Scotland\u2019s National Health Service showing that they had discussed the possibility of a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system in which the wealthy would pay for their care. The introduction of small co-payments for overstretched services like general practice and accident &amp; emergency (A&amp;E) departments has also been mooted. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To the charge that rationing has no part in a universal health-care system, proponents riposte that it already exists. Prescriptions are free for some patients, for example, but not for others. And whereas other health-care systems rely on price to manage demand, the NHS uses hidden mechanisms: administrative hoops, snarling receptionists and endless waiting lists. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Co-payments might curb demand, but they would do so by deterring patients from seeking care. Some people, particularly the poor, would not seek treatment when they need it. In dentistry, where patients are already charged for appointments (with some exemptions), the government has ramped up patient charges while reducing its own funding over the past decade. England now spends the lowest share of its health budget on dentistry of any country in Europe. The underfunded dental contract has pushed thousands of dentists into private practice. That has created a two-tier system in which the rich go private and those who cannot afford or find an NHS dentist resort to DIY treatments involving pliers and alcohol."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another suggestion for fundamental reform is that Britain should switch to a social-insurance model, similar to that operating in France, Germany or the Netherlands. At the moment the NHS is funded out of general taxation. Under a social-insurance model, employees and employers pay contributions into a not-for-profit fund which is then used to purchase health care. Advocates suggest that by earmarking money for the NHS, this system might make people feel more responsible for their own health. And by taking responsibility for financing health care away from the government, it might also reduce the temptation for politicians to meddle."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet meta-analyses suggest that there is no relationship between a country\u2019s choice of funding system and its health outcomes. And all health systems have their own challenges. In the Netherlands GPs spend almost three times as much of their time on admin as their British counterparts, who already feel they are drowning in paperwork. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Making changes of this magnitude would be a huge political gamble, too. A recent survey by Ipsos, a pollster, found that 90% of Britons believe the NHS should be free at the point of delivery, and 84% think the NHS should be funded primarily through taxation. Such consensus is not found on other issues. Trying to switch to a new model would be \u201clike throwing rocks at Everest\u201d, says Alastair McLellan, who edits the Health Service Journal, a website. \u201cThe NHS is a fixed fact. Clever policymakers work with that, not against it.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If ripping up the NHS\u2019s founding principles is not an answer, radicalism is nonetheless required. That is because the NHS is far too focused on one element of the health-care system\u2014hospitals. Aneurin Bevan, the Labour politician who was the architect of the NHS, called hospitals the \u201cvertebrae of the health system\u201d. It is more accurate to think of them as sponges.

By current prices, 47% of all central- and local-government spending on health care in Britain goes on hospitals, compared with 44% of funding from comparable schemes in France, 36% in the Netherlands and 33% in Germany. Within the OECD, when comparing government-funded or compulsory schemes, only America spends a bigger share of its GDP on hospitals (see chart 3). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A hospital-focused model worked well enough when the NHS was mainly there to provide urgent treatment for infections and injuries. Those days are long gone. The latest available data showed that half of all GP appointments and 70% of inpatient bed days were taken by those with long-term conditions, such as diabetes. Family doctors and community nurses are best-placed to manage these chronic conditions, yet only 8% of the NHS budget goes to general practice, down from 11% in 2005-06. Hospitals are plainly not the places to prevent things which contribute to ill-health, like obesity. Britain is the third-fattest country in Europe; if everyone was a healthy weight, a recent study found, the NHS could save up to \u00a314bn a year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It gets worse. Hospitals are primarily paid on the basis of \u201cactivity\u201d, which at times incentivises them to perform unnecessary treatments and not collaborate with other bits of the NHS. An estimated 10% of the cost of inpatient care in hospitals is spent looking after those in the final year of life, often on ineffective tests and treatments. Meanwhile, general practice and community services are often funded by fixed budgets in exchange for broadly defined services. They have little incentive to reduce referrals to other services. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The system does not just suck patients into hospitals but also keeps them there for too long, in part because of a shortage of carers. More than one in ten beds are occupied by people who do not need them. To speed up delays in discharging patients, some hospitals are even giving money to cash-strapped councils to pay for social care. \u201cIf everything is focused on acute hospitals that have already spent nearly half of the entire NHS budget, the NHS will fail,\u201d says Joe Harrison, who runs an acute trust in Milton Keynes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such warnings are not new. Nor are calls to shift money away from crisis management in hospitals and towards community care and prevention. \u201cWe are often not invited to meetings as it is seen as predictable what we will say,\u201d says Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly banging the drum on funding.\u201d That might invite scepticism that anything will change. But two big building-blocks are moving into place. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One gives regions more freedom to improve the health of their own populations. The NHS has long suffered from top-downitis, with the centre issuing a blizzard of orders and performance metrics. In his book \u201cZero\u201d, Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary and now the chancellor of the exchequer, recalls asking one hospital how many instructions it received related to patient safety: the answer was 108 documents a year. Such bureaucracy is hugely counterproductive\u2014a classic case of hitting the target but missing the point."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The latest organisational shake-up of the NHS is therefore promising. In 2022 the Health and Care Act created 42 Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), each covering an average of 1.5m people. They bring together NHS bodies, local authorities and charities to plan and deliver health and care services in a more joined-up way. Each ICS also chooses longer-term goals to work towards, such as reducing health inequality. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bits of the NHS have already worked out the value of co-ordination. \u201cIt\u2019s just completely bloody obvious that we all need to work together,\u201d says Sir Jim Mackey, the boss of Northumbria Healthcare Foundation Trust, which has been working with other partners for decades. But ICSs should make that more common. To take one example, on average homeless people use eight times as many health services as other people (mainly A&amp;E and ambulances). Instead of trying to manage this demand, West Yorkshire\u2019s ICS works to reduce homelessness\u2014for instance, by helping tenants at risk of eviction to improve their mental health. \u201cYou have to start with the needs of the people, not structures,\u201d says Rob Webster, its chief executive."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To be truly beneficial, ICSs will need to be made more \u201chard-edged\u201d, says Axel Heitmueller of Imperial College Health Partners, a partnership of NHS providers. Data can already be used to measure a small set of population-health outcomes, such as healthy life expectancy. To incentivise improvements on these measures, he reckons ICSs should be able to \u201cearn back\u201d a proportion of the savings they make from helping people to get healthier and be allowed to reinvest this money."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second crucial building-block for reform is technology. There is an awful lot still to do in this area. Less than half of ICSs have a data platform to help them manage their populations\u2019 health. Privacy concerns and bungled implementation have impeded efforts to join up patient records\u2014and to realise the potential of the NHS, which is unusual in holding cradle-to-grave information on a national population, as one of the most valuable repositories of health data in the world. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the NHS is taking steps towards a future of greater productivity and more personalised care. It has already had success rolling out virtual wards\u2014for example, using pulse oximeters to monitor the breathing efficiency of recently discharged patients. It is carrying out breast-cancer scans in shopping centres and cataract surgery in car parks. In partnership with Our Future Health, a programme that aims to track the health of 5m Britons, blood samples are now being taken in the back rooms of Boots, a high-street pharmacist. In future the results will allow more targeted screening for cancer and the creation of individual risk scores. Genomic sequencing should help the NHS to spot diseases earlier, to the benefit of patients and taxpayers.

In future the app could become the new front door to the NHS, with options for self-referrals, self-monitoring and home testing. Through Patients Know Best, a software company, patients can already get access via the app to an individual patient record which shows them their results and their medical records.
