Data on insurance claims from Komodo Health, a health-care-technology company, shows that in the second half of 2022 vasectomy rates across America were far higher than in previous years.

Between 2017 and 2021, the rate at which surgeries were performed increased by an average of 4% each year. But the number of American men who report having had the procedure is lower than it was 20 years ago (and vasectomy rates still lag far behind rates of tubal ligation, the more invasive equivalent for women). In 2002 national health surveys estimated that 6.9% of the male population aged 18-45 had been snipped. The most recent round of surveys, carried out between 2017 and 2019, put the figure at 5.4%.

Normally, the number of procedures peaks towards the end of the year, when patients are more likely to have reached their insurance deductible (although this is probably overstated in our data, which do not capture vasectomies paid for in cash). Surgery rates also get a boost in March, which some urologists market as \u201cvasectomy season\u201d, a time when men can spend the day or two needed for recovery from the procedure watching March Madness basketball."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230527_WOC336.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1587.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The bump in vasectomies following Dobbs could be seen in 46 states.

Others, who had been considering the procedure for a while, were apparently spurred by a concern that vasectomy could be outlawed next.

Like any surgery, it involves recovery time and risk of complications, however small. And for many men there are also misconceptions and concerns about how the procedure might affect their sense of masculinity. But making the sacrifice lifts the burden of responsibility for contraception from women. Studies have shown that high rates of vasectomy tend to go hand in hand with gender equality. Overturning Roe v Wade has been a brutal blow for women\u2019s rights in America. The rise in vasectomies may be one very small consolation. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 22}
