Not for them the common talk of European officials about the need to \u201cde-risk\u201d relations with China and to treat it as a \u201csystemic rival\u201d. Co-operation between Hungary and China presents \u201copportunities rather than risks\u201d, said Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, in Beijing on May 15th.

Hungary echoes China\u2019s view that Western support for Ukraine is merely fuelling the conflict at Europe\u2019s expense. Speaking to Bloomberg on May 23rd, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, defended his blocking of a $540m package of EU financial aid to Ukraine. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance to win this war,\u201d he said. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other countries in eastern Europe, such as Poland, had shared Hungary\u2019s fondness for close ties with China. But their enthusiasm has been dented by China\u2019s support for Russia during the Ukrainian war, and a sense that the business rewards of embracing China politically have not been as great as expected. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "China sees good uses in friendship with Europe. The eu is a vital trading partner. Moreover the bloc could, if it wished, soften the impact of America\u2019s rivalry with China by taking a less security-focused approach. Officials in Beijing are alarmed by a recent trend\u2014seen not least in critical joint statements at a g7 meeting in Tokyo on May 21st\u2014towards greater transatlantic co-operation on China, notwithstanding differences among eu members over how far this should go. During a trip to China last month France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, warned that European countries should not become \u201cjust America\u2019s followers\u201d regarding Taiwan. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Hungary is special. The worldviews of Mr Orban and of China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, have much in common. They are both authoritarians (albeit to different degrees), who bridle at American power but believe the West is in decline. They are both fond of Russia. Mr Orban\u2019s friends in the business world stand to benefit from deals with authoritarian regimes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hungary is well-placed to serve China\u2019s foreign-policy interests. As a member of the eu it has a veto over foreign and security policy. It has used it to dilute or scupper eu statements critical of China. It is also a member of nato, an alliance that China views with growing misgivings. Hungary has shown occasional willingness to thumb its nose there, too, for instance in its recent support for Turkey in blocking Sweden\u2019s accession. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "So, as China sees it, a country of fewer than 10m people and one of the poorest in the eu has an outsize role to play. This was evident in February when Mr Wang went on his first overseas tour since taking over as China\u2019s foreign-affairs chief (state media confirmed his promotion in January; it means he outranks Qin Gang, the foreign minister). He visited France, Italy and then Germany for the Munich Security Conference of global foreign-policy elites. Before heading to Moscow, he stopped in Hungary where he praised the country\u2019s \u201cChina-friendly policy\u201d, according to Hungarian media. Mr Szijjarto thanked him for China\u2019s \u201cabsolutely indispensable\u201d support during the covid-19 pandemic, including the supply of Chinese-made vaccines (which Hungary used in defiance of an eu consensus that covid vaccines deployed in the bloc should first gain eu approval). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the past couple of years, it might have been expected that events in Hungary would give China pause for thought. Mr Orban, who has ruled the country since 2010 and emerged even stronger after another victory in general elections last year, remains a dependable friend. Polls suggest that Hungarians are among the people most supportive of China within the eu (it helps that the country\u2019s mostly pro-government media stifle China-sceptic views). But China-related protests in Budapest in 2021 and recently in Debrecen, the country\u2019s second-largest city, have raised questions about how enduring this sentiment will prove. A survey published last year by Pew Research Centre, an American polling outfit, found that 52% of respondents in Hungary held negative views of China, a rise of 15 points since 2019."}, {"role": "body", "text": "South of Budapest\u2019s city centre, in the semi-wasteland of an abandoned logistics hub, street signs recall the unrest in the capital two years ago that brought anxieties about China\u2014at least briefly\u2014into public debate. The names on them are pokes at China: \u201cUyghur Martyrs Street\u201d and \u201cBishop Hszie Si-kuang Street\u201d (after the late Xie Shiguang, a Catholic, imprisoned for 30 years). In 2021 the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karacsony, gave the roads these new labels (also a Dalai Lama Street and a Free Hong Kong Street) in protest against a plan to build a campus of Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University on the nearby land. Leaked official documents showed that construction would cost $1.8bn, with 80% of the money coming from a Chinese loan.

Three days after the renaming of the streets, thousands joined a rally to denounce the campus plan. Complaints about it ranged from possible stifling of academic debate to the loss of land that had been earmarked for subsidised student housing. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Orban appeared to back down, agreeing to a referendum on the plan. But after his re-election in 2022 the Constitutional Court said such a ballot could not be held because it would involve an international agreement.

Some analysts in Budapest say China, alarmed by public anger, may have got cold feet."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fractured after last year\u2019s election, the opposition shows little sign of trying to revive public interest. But in the past few months in Debrecen, the government\u2019s own supporters have joined a campaign that still simmers against another Chinese project. It involves a plan, announced in August by catl, a Chinese battery giant, to build a factory just outside the city in the village of Mikepercs at a cost of around $7.7bn. It would make batteries for electric vehicles (evs), the largest such facility in Europe. Hungary\u2019s efforts to develop its ev industry have attracted others, too. Last year bmw, a German firm, began building a $2bn ev and battery factory in Debrecen. This month another Chinese firm, eve Energy, said it would set up a $1.2bn battery factory to supply bmw\u2019s plant.

The media give little coverage, they say. Any difficulty for his party, Fidesz, will remain largely local. Opposition politicians have attacked another multi-billion-dollar endeavour involving Chinese firms: a new rail link between Budapest and Belgrade in neighbouring Serbia (work on the Hungarian side began in 2021). They say it is overpriced and worry about favouritism in awarding contracts. But China regards the project as a highlight of its belt-and-road building in Europe, for which Mr Orban is a cheerleader. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For all the shifts in European attitudes to China, it is likely that Mr Xi will make few adjustments. Despite Mr Orban\u2019s political isolation in Europe, he shows no sign of distancing himself from China. As long as he remains in power, Hungary will be a useful ally. \u201cStudying its position on China could offer lessons for developing good relations between China and other European countries,\u201d wrote two Chinese scholars in a paper published this year in a Communist Party journal. One obvious lesson would be that pro-Russian, illiberal governments make solid friends. China\u2019s options in Europe are narrowing. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 17}
