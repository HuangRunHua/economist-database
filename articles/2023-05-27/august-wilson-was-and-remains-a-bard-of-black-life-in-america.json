In Smith\u2019s proud, mournful voice, he heard a way to hold onto the past while moving forward; to rue fate yet embrace life.

The ten parts of his American Century Cycle\u2014which, between them, won two Pulitzers and heaps of acclaim for chronicling the black American experience in each decade of the 20th century\u2014are still finding new audiences on stage and screen. This year, as usual, his work has been performed across America: \u201cRadio Golf\u201d in Philadelphia, \u201cFences\u201d in Jackson, Mississippi, \u201cTwo Trains Running\u201d in Miami. \u201cHow I Learned What I Learned\u201d, his autobiographical one-man show, recently closed in Seattle; \u201cJitney\u201d comes to London in July. Meanwhile, Netflix has announced a screen adaptation of \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d, with John David Washington and Samuel L. Jackson reprising their roles from a Broadway hit (nominated for a pair of Tony awards at the ceremony on June 11th)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "These plays endure because Wilson achieved his goal of presenting black life \u201con its own terms\u2026with all its richness and fullness\u201d. Although the white world looms at the edges of these stories, it remains largely offstage. Wilson was concerned with the rituals and beauty of ordinary black Americans as they forged a culture in unpropitious circumstances. His characters are not slaves, but nor are they entirely free\u2014denied the jobs and loans claimed by the European families who arrived in America at the turn of the 20th century. They hustle and dream, but know the game is rigged. As a frustrated musician says in \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d, which in 2020 became a film starring Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman: \u201cIs you gonna be satisfied with a bone somebody done throwed you when you see them eating the whole hog?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most of these dramas unfold in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, which, when Wilson was growing up there, was a slum known as \u201cLittle Harlem\u201d. Though he was originally named Frederick August Kittel junior after his mostly absent white German father, Wilson said he never questioned his racial identity because no one else seemed to: \u201cAll the things that were closed to Negroes at that time were closed to me.\u201d As the only black student in his Catholic high-school class, he was greeted every morning by racist invective. He dropped out of formal schooling at 15 when a teacher accused him of plagiarism, on the presumption that his essay was too good for him to have written it himself."}, {"role": "second", "text": "A song for all seasons"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Wilson read everything he could at his local library, then got another education listening to the banter of community elders at a nearby pool hall. He knew he was a writer, and sensed that it was a rare job he could do without being under someone\u2019s thumb: \u201cNobody said, \u2018Hey, you can\u2019t do that.\u2019 So I felt free.\u201d He spent years scribbling poems and stories before turning to plays in earnest in his 30s. After a couple of false starts, he found his rhythm, writing \u201cJitney\u201d, \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d and \u201cJoe Turner\u2019s Come and Gone\u201d between 1982 and 1984.

During the Black Power era of the 1960s, Wilson and a friend had founded a theatre troupe in Pittsburgh that aimed to \u201craise consciousness\u201d with dramas that put white characters on trial and occasionally murdered them. But he came to see that he could send a stronger message by reproducing the rhythms and nuances of black life on stage, along with its slang. With his anthropological ear for the vernacular, Wilson saw his history plays as a way for black Americans to finally tell their own story. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be pointed toward a future,\u201d he reckoned, \u201cwe must know our past.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The women in his plays are outnumbered by the men, but tend to be sturdier, more sensible and more memorable. Their wisdom seems to come from resignation: relegated to lives of laundry and cooking, they know better than to dream big.

Themes such as the trials of marriage, tussles between fathers and sons, and the hunger for redemption resonate with audiences of all backgrounds. By proving the commercial viability of African-American theatre, he opened the door for other black artists, such as Lynn Nottage and Suzan-Lori Parks, both Pulitzer-prizewinners. \u201cI just want to say for the record: you are our king,\u201d Ms Parks told Wilson in 2005."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Appetite for his work is unabated. After acquiring the playwright\u2019s extensive archive in 2020, the University of Pittsburgh made it available this year, citing demand from scholars, historians and students.
