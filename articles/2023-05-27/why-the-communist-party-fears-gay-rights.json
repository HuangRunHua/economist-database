This campaign of repression reveals a lot about President Xi Jinping\u2019s China, a paranoid place in which security agencies and ideological commissars enjoy ever-greater clout.

It is heard when university chiefs punish students for handing out rainbow flags, or when officials press landlords to evict non-profit groups. The message is that sexual minorities pose a political risk. True, some officials and state-backed scholars also call same-sex love an affront to mainstream Chinese morality, and a threat to young people whose patriotic duty is to marry and have more babies for the Motherland. But activists report that, during interrogations, national security is emphasised much more than morality. Despite the political chill, gay people (as well as bars and dating apps) enjoy far more tolerance than they did a generation ago\u2014but only if they keep it quiet. In today\u2019s China, forming a community is a graver offence than being gay.

Criminal penalties for gay sex were abolished only in 1997. During a first posting to Beijing in 2000, Chaguan heard a foreign government minister report, with disbelief, the claim of a Chinese counterpart that there were no gay men in China. Remarkable changes followed. Activists worked to persuade Chinese officials that social stability\u2014the party\u2019s great obsession\u2014is strengthened by their activities. Some state media and institutions seemed to agree, offering praise for health-education campaigns or HIV-prevention work done by gay groups.

This baby step towards gay marriage took advantage of a law initially drafted with the elderly in mind. Later it was adapted by creative lawyers to let same-sex couples take medical and some financial decisions for each other, should they grow infirm, undergo surgery or otherwise lose their faculties. That same year, over 180,000 members of the public submitted comments to legislators drafting new regulations on marriage in China\u2019s civil code. Many suggested changing \u201chusband and wife\u201d to \u201cspouses\u201d as a first step towards same-sex marriage. A large number of petitioners were mobilised by legal-rights groups such as LGBT Rights Advocacy China. Since then, that petition drive backing same-sex unions has been cited by Chinese diplomats abroad as proof that their country allows free speech and bans discrimination against gay people, most recently at a hearing this February of a UN rights committee. What those smooth-talking envoys did not mention is that, back at home, civil society groups behind that self-same petition have been shut down, including LGBT Rights Advocacy China, which closed in 2021."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Large companies have bowed to political pressures, too. In 2020 a state-owned airline, China Southern, fired a gay flight attendant seen kissing a male pilot on a surveillance video that went viral on social media.

In 2021 WeChat, the omnipresent messaging, e-commerce and social media app, closed dozens of accounts on LGBT topics, especially those run by university students. In recent years, regulators have banned \u201ceffeminate men\u201d from television shows, and denounced \u201cboys\u2019 love\u201d dramas, a genre involving thinly disguised homo-erotic themes.

As a young Malaysian studying in China, Raymond Phang helped to co-found ShanghaiPRIDE, an organiser of gay celebrations and events. He and fellow volunteers grew used to assuring police that events would not feature political statements from foreign diplomats, or touch on such sensitive topics as Taiwan. No public parades or outdoor gatherings were attempted. The group eschewed slogans like \u201cGay Rights Now\u201d, says Mr Phang. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that in the mainland, it\u2019s more about awareness, and \u2018LGBT is not a sickness\u2019.\u201d He calls ShanghaiPRIDE lucky, because none of its volunteers or staff was taken into custody for 24 or 48 hours, as happened to some groups.
