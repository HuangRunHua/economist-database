Some fear that Saudi Arabia under its bearish crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, better known as MBS, wants to turn Jordan into a kind of fief. Two years ago Jordan\u2019s security courts accused unnamed foreign powers (guess who?) of trying to replace Abdullah with his half-brother, Hamzah, a charge vehemently denied.

And might the new alliance encourage the Saudis to pay off Jordan\u2019s grinding debts? The Jordanian royal family, including the crown prince\u2019s mother, Queen Rania, has recently been careful not to display its wealth too showily. The wedding may be relatively modest."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gulf-watchers will note whether MbS attends. He has scant regard for many of his relatives, having imprisoned a bunch of them. He has a habit of embracing with one arm and casting adrift with the other. Earlier this month he hugged President Bashar al-Assad of Syria on his first visit to Saudi Arabia in over 12 years. Some say he then denied him a private audience and refused to promise any cash to rebuild the devastated country."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One person who cherished Jordan\u2019s link to Saudi Arabia is in jail. For years Bassem Awadallah ran King Abdullah\u2019s court, before moving to the Saudi capital at Riyadh to advise MbS. But after he came back to Jordan he fell out with its regime and was sentenced to 15 years in prison there, allegedly for plotting with Hamzah.
