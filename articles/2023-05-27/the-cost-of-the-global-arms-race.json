In the early 1980s, a period in which Ronald Reagan built up America\u2019s military capabilities, it easily outpaced economy-wide price rises. In the Vietnam war it briefly hit 48% on an annual basis. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even so, there is little reason to believe that the new cold war will be sharply inflationary. Not even the fiercest hawks are calling for defence spending, as a share of gdp, to return to the levels of the 1960s or 1970s. Barring a hot war between big powers, global defence spending is unlikely to grow above the low single digits of global gdp\u2014meaning that its impact on global aggregate demand, and thus inflation, will be similarly small.

Modern armies require ever fewer people\u2014allowing military planners to cut headcounts (though service members can become more expensive).

Many planners bemoan the growing cost of each platform, but they improve with each iteration. \u201cThese days you can hit dozens of targets with a single bomber, rather than vice versa, which used to be the case,\u201d argues James Geurts, a retired air-force colonel who advises Lux Capital, a venture-capital firm.
