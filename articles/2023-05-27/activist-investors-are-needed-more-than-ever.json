Bosses stay awake worrying about a call, a letter or a 100-page presentation in which a hedge fund outlines the depths of their ineptitude.

Nevertheless in recent months some of the world\u2019s largest firms\u2014including Alphabet, Bayer, Disney and Salesforce\u2014have had to tussle with activists, who are increasingly focused on the biggest companies.

Only one in three dollars invested by institutions in America\u2019s thousand largest public companies is actively allocated, according to Man Group, an investment firm. The biggest passive asset-managers, such as BlackRock, charge low fees and run lean investment-stewardship teams which are not designed to spot empire-building bosses or lazy boards. The result is an increasingly idle corporate electorate. Efforts to enfranchise the ultimate owners of funds are unlikely to solve the problem. They typically want to earn returns but leave the decision-making to somebody else. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are other channels by which bosses\u2019 feet might be held to the fire.

Today, however, the buy-out industry is roiling from the effects of higher interest rates, and is unlikely to recover fully for some time."}, {"role": "body", "text": "While the routes by which managers are held to account have shrunk, the need to boost profits by applying discipline has grown. When interest rates were low, large technology firms hired aggressively and expanded into peripheral lines of business. Now profits are more important than growth. Over the past decade the demand for managers to respond to environmental, social and governance (esg) concerns has also grown.
