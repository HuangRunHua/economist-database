A wider category, alternatively powered vehicles (APVs), which lumps together pure electric and plug-in and non-plug-in hybrids, made up more than half the EU car market during the last quarter of 2022, with over 1.3m vehicles registered in total.

Electric cars have a much higher market share in northern and western European countries, where average post-tax incomes are \u20ac32,000 a year, than in southern and eastern Europe, where the average is less than half that. Yet because of lower global prices for lithium and other materials needed for battery production, as well as government subsidies, the economies of scale of rapidly increasing production and stiff competition, especially from Chinese producers, prices for EVs are falling faster than some forecast. \u201cBy 2025 or 2026 most carmakers will be able to build petrol-powered cars and EVs for the same price,\u201d predicts Daniel R\u00f6ska of Bernstein Research.

In March the European Commission announced a new law aimed at appeasing worries about gaps. It sets targets for electric recharging and hydrogen refuelling, such as a requirement that for each battery-powered car in an EU member state, a power output of at least 1.3 kilowatt (kw) must be provided by publicly accessible chargers. And for every 60km along the trans-European road network, a fast recharging station with a total of at least 150kw of capacity should be installed from 2025 onwards."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is not nearly enough, says the European carmakers\u2019 lobby. \u201cAlready today, a lack of charging and refuelling stations is severely hampering the market uptake of zero-emission vehicles,\u201d comments Sigrid de Vries, ACEA\u2019s director-general. She predicts that \u201ca significant infrastructure gap\u201d will continue to limit the transition of Europe\u2019s car industry. In response, some carmakers started building their own charging networks a while ago, led by Tesla. In January Mercedes announced it will put in place some 10,000 chargers worldwide by the end of the decade."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fit for 55, a climate package with 13 proposals presented by the European Commission in July 2021, increased the ambition for the fight against greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions to a reduction of emissions by 55% (compared with levels in 1990) by 2030 from the original 40% reduction proposed back in 2011. Transport is one of the keys to success. It accounts for 22% of the EU\u2019s total emissions. Within that, 70% comes from road transport; and road transport is the only sector where emissions have steadily risen since 1990. (The EU has reduced its overall carbon footprint by 30% since 1990, mainly by burning less coal to generate electricity.) In a report in October the commission said the EU was \u201con track to deliver on its climate ambition\u201d, but that \u201cswift action\u201d was required to meet the 2030 goals as well as the 2050 net-zero ambition.

They include a ban on the sale of new internal-combustion engines (ICE) by 2035, and new rules that beef up the targets for emission reductions by 2030 for sectors covered by Europe\u2019s emissions trading system (ETS). The ETS is a cap-and-trade scheme in which permits to emit carbon are allocated to aviation, energy-intensive industries and power generators, and can then be traded between them. The proposals also add transport and domestic heating to the existing ETS scheme. Moreover, new levies at the EU\u2019s borders for carbon-intensive imports, such as industrial materials, are part of the proposals, as well as the establishment of a \u201csocial climate fund\u201d that will be used to help vulnerable households and small firms cope with the price increases of bringing heating and transport into the ETS.

Germany\u2019s recent last-minute attempts to block the ban of new ICE powered cars from 2035 does not augur well. Germany insisted on allowing some new ICE cars to be built after 2035, so long as they are fuelled with carbon-neutral e-fuels, such as ethanol. Critics fear this will open the door to cheating."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Likewise, Italy\u2019s right-wing government is now pushing back against the EU\u2019s plans to improve the insulation and energy efficiency of public and residential buildings. Buildings account for roughly 40% of the EU\u2019s energy consumption and 36% of its carbon emissions. Yet Italy\u2019s housing stock is older and more dilapidated than that of many other countries, so meeting the targets will require extensive and costly renovations. Italy\u2019s construction association says that some 2m buildings will need renovation over the next ten years, at the eye-watering cost of \u20ac40bn-60bn a year, if it is to meet the EU\u2019s green homes plans. Italy\u2019s government also backed Germany in its last-minute reversal on the end of the ICE, and criticises the proposal to slash industrial emissions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFit for 55 is entirely on track; that is, the main laws have literally just been voted and now need to be implemented,\u201d says a Brussels official.
