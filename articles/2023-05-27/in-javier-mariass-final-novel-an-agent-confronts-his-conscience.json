Whether exploring academic life, marriage or the murky world of espionage, the Spanish author\u2019s novels, written over five decades, blend intellectual inquiry with playful and artful high jinks."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mar\u00edas\u2019s final book revisits characters and themes from his penultimate one, \u201cBerta Isla\u201d (published in 2017). He saw \u201cTom\u00e1s Nevinson\u201d as a \u201ccompanion piece\u201d to its predecessor\u2014but it is a better novel. The eponymous hero comes fully alive as he navigates shadowy machinations and ethical quandaries."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Tom\u00e1s Nevinson\u2019s days in the British Secret Service are over. Back in his home town of Madrid, the half-English, half-Spanish former spy is trying to rebuild his family life after years of \u201cenforced exile\u201d. But when his old handler and manipulator, Bertram Tupra, tracks him down and tempts him with one last assignment, Tom\u00e1s is roused from retirement, reactivated and once again obliged to \u201cdovetail lies and false identities\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "His mission requires him to go undercover in north-west Spain and find out which of three women is a terrorist with ETA, a Basque separatist group, who is now lying low after taking part in bombings in Barcelona and Zaragoza. Posing as a teacher of English, Tom\u00e1s embarks on a charm offensive, befriending the women\u2014a fellow schoolteacher, a restaurant owner and a trapped wife\u2014and forging more intimate relations with one of them. He watches their movements and reactions, all the while looking for clues that might betray a hidden identity and a role in past crimes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But then Tupra, impatient for results, changes the rules. If Tom\u00e1s cannot unmask and dispatch the terrorist, then all three women will have to die. Can he find the culprit in time\u2014and will he have the unscrupulous courage to carry out his \u201cblood mission\u201d?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those who prefer their espionage thrillers lean and taut may be put off by this hulking tome. But like the stories in Mar\u00edas\u2019s bravura trilogy, \u201cYour Face Tomorrow\u201d, \u201cTom\u00e1s Nevinson\u201d is a different kind of spy novel. It unfolds in meandering yet mesmerising sentences. Some describe scenes, others contribute to free-flowing monologues or digressive meditations. The author\u2019s other trademark tropes, from literary allusions to historical references and philosophical debates, all feature."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Occasionally the narrative is weighed down by ponderous musings on topics such as hatred, justice and killing for the greater good. But it is never long before readers are again enthralled by Mar\u00edas\u2019s high-stakes plot, his protagonist\u2019s tangled web of deceit and the sharp scrutiny of guilt, doubt, betrayal and memory. Now seamlessly translated by Margaret Jull Costa, this final work is a stimulating drama by a master of his craft. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 62}
