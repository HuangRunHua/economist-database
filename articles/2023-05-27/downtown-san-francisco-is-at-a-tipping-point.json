Fog enveloping the Golden Gate Bridge. Hippies tuning in and dropping out on Haight Street. Tents lining the pavement. These days, a \u201cRetail for lease\u201d sign in a vacant storefront seems appropriate. San Francisco itself has become a symbol, too, though what it represents depends on your politics. It is a hub of technological innovation or a bastion of inequality; a laboratory for the country\u2019s most progressive policies or a fief of the radical left. No mid-size American city\u2014San Francisco has fewer people than Indianapolis\u2014has had a bigger effect on global culture or financial markets.

Local and national media are publishing obituaries for the city. Local officials decry the coverage, but they also admit that something is deeply wrong. \u201cSan Francisco has had what felt like an endless, year-after-year boom,\u201d says Aaron Peskin, president of the Board of Supervisors, the city council. \u201cAnd now the bubble really burst.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are two groups of problems.

That is small consolation. All three cities have some of the highest rates of homelessness in the country. The difference is that San Francisco is more densely populated. Nearly 42,000 homeless people live in Los Angeles, but in neighbourhoods across the sprawling city, from Skid Row to Venice Beach. A high share of San Francisco\u2019s rough sleepers are in a single neighbourhood, the Tenderloin, next to downtown."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second problem is financial. \u201cWhen the pandemic happened, a good portion of San Francisco was able to literally pick up their laptops and go home,\u201d says Rodney Fong of the city\u2019s chamber of commerce. The University of Toronto has been measuring pandemic recovery in 63 American downtowns, since March 2020, by comparing mobile-phone use in city centres with pre-pandemic numbers. San Francisco\u2019s recovery ranks last. The office-vacancy rate is nearing 30%, a record high. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These woes could spread beyond the city centre. Downtown generated at least 75% of the city\u2019s GDP in 2021, and city revenues depend on downtown property and business taxes. As that pot of money shrinks\u2014property taxes paid by offices could decline by up to 35% by 2028\u2014the city will not be able to provide the same services.

Local officials want the state to prop up the Bay Area subway system, BART, which ferries people downtown, but Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, has to plug a $32bn budget shortfall of his own. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when your best-case scenario is bad,\u201d says Ted Egan, the city\u2019s chief economist."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some things may yet stop the bleeding. The city\u2019s network effects are diminished by the rise of other tech hubs, but remain mighty. Several leading AI startups are based in San Francisco, including OpenAI, which created ChatGPT.

But in the meantime, things look grim. Mr Egan says he recently visited a class of Stanford University students who were discussing their post-college plans. \u201cHow many of you are moving to San Francisco after you graduate?\u201d he recalls their professor asking.
