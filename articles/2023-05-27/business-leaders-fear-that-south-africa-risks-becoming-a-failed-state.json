Here was one of their own: a pragmatic tycoon to fix the incompetent kleptocracy of Jacob Zuma. Yet five years on, bosses of large businesses are exasperated. CEOs from several different industries\u2014such as Neal Froneman of Sibanye-Stillwater, a mining company; Daniel Mminele, the incoming chair of Nedbank; and Ralph Mupita, of MTN, a telecoms firm\u2014have sounded the alarm.

As international firms and capital left South Africa in the 1980s, the domestic groups that dominated South African business got bigger. By the end of the decade three conglomerates controlled companies accounting for 75% of the market value of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). But some tycoons saw that white rule was unsustainable. So in 1985, defying the wishes of the apartheid regime, the chair of Anglo-American took a group to meet exiled leaders of the ANC. One delegate, upon meeting Thabo Mbeki, joked to the future president: \u201cWelcome to the capitalist class!\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those talks led to an unwritten deal. The ANC would drop its pledge to nationalise big companies. Business would embrace affirmative action and enrich a black elite including, most notably, Mr Ramaphosa. In other respects the basic structure of the South African economy changed little. Many of the same big firms still predominate\u2014and feel less competitive pressure than peers in other parts of the world. According to research by the IMF, mark-ups by publicly listed firms increased by 25% from 2000 to 2016. The average rise globally was 6%. Sustained mark-ups, namely prices above the marginal cost of production, imply a lack of competition."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Problems have been thrashed out in private. In 2015, Mr Zuma tanked the rand by replacing a respected finance minister\u2014who had helped block a multi-billion dollar nuclear-power deal with Russia\u2014with an obscure MP.

Last year power cuts may have reduced GDP by 7-8%; 2023 could be even darker.

Andre de Ruyter, Eskom\u2019s former head who courageously tried to root out graft, was nearly fatally poisoned in December. (Do not use a personalised coffee mug, he says, when asked if he has advice for his successor.) Western officials worry that South Africa is becoming to money-laundering what Silicon Valley is to venture capital.

Rather than take part in yet more state-led initiatives, the top 40 or 50 CEOs should gather with unions and NGOs to thrash out a new \u201csocial contract\u201d.
