Russia says that the militias are a front for the Ukrainian army; Ukraine insists that they are composed of Russian dissidents. The reality is somewhere in between. Both militias do indeed recruit disaffected Russian nationals. Both also co-ordinate their activities with hur, Ukraine\u2019s military-intelligence agency.
