Robert Oppenheimer greets you at every turn. The local event centre\u2014which hosted an Oppenheimer festival to celebrate the release of Christopher Nolan\u2019s new film about the father of the atomic bomb\u2014is just off Oppenheimer Drive. A bronze statue of Oppenheimer, dapper hat and pipe included, stands on a street corner. The local pub offers Oppenheimer trivia. To pay homage to the \u201cTrinity test\u201d detonation of Oppenheimer\u2019s bomb in the New Mexican desert, there is Trinity Drive, Trinity Urgent Care and Trinity on the Hill Episcopal Church. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Oppenheimer was recruited to run the Manhattan Project in 1942, he chose to build his laboratories in Los Alamos. The site, in the government\u2019s view, was an ideal place for bomb-building. The desert mesas and ponderosa pine forests offered solitude and secrecy. But Oppenheimer also had a personal reason for picking the Land of Enchantment. Early in Mr Nolan\u2019s film, Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) admits to being homesick for New Mexico, where he and his brother owned a ranch. \u201cWhen I was a kid\u201d, he says, \u201cI thought if I could find a way to mix physics and New Mexico, my life would be perfect.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The most notable thing about the town, apart from its history and vistas, is that it is home to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the successor to Oppenheimer\u2019s science campus, where research on nuclear weapons continues. But the release of Mr Nolan\u2019s film has residents rolling out the red carpet. Tourism is surging. Wendy Berhman, who runs the Manhattan Project National Historical Park, says visitor numbers have more than doubled since last year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Locals are still starstruck, even a year after Hollywood\u2019s glitterati descended on their stretch of desert. \u201cI believe I was there when Nolan decided to film in the Oppenheimer house,\u201d says Leslie Linke of the Los Alamos Historical Society. \u201cI could see it in his eyes.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Nolan\u2019s film dwells on Oppenheimer\u2019s internal battle between his relentless pursuit of scientific inquiry and his moral qualms about the lethal purpose of his lab\u2019s invention. Yet Los Alamos\u2019s shrines to the Manhattan Project feel more celebratory than sombre. Plaques around town salute the scientists whose work \u201cended world war two\u201d and \u201cdeterred global conflict\u201d. A re-examination of Oppenheimer\u2019s legacy is slowly taking place, however. Posters in the visitor centre mention the Hispanic homesteaders and tribes that were forced off their land so the government could build Oppenheimer\u2019s secret city. New Mexicans exposed to radiation from the Trinity test, known as \u201cDownwinders\u201d, say their health was sacrificed for America\u2019s atomic advantage.
