He is the 70-year-old chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager. It invests trillions of dollars on behalf of its clients, which include pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies. The firm, with a market value of about $100bn, is the world leader in innovative low-cost investment funds. Its assets under management, valued at $9.4trn, include stakes in about 18,000 listed companies across the Western world. When Fink talks, people listen \u2013 and Fink certainly likes to talk."

But in recent years a faction has remonstrated against firms that speak out on issues like climate change, lgbt rights and other subjects that they consider \u201cwoke\u201d. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida and the leading challenger to Donald Trump in next year\u2019s Republican presidential primary contest, is its most prominent advocate."

The theory behind it suggests that you can measure companies\u2019 performance on metrics other than financial returns, though the scoring systems are subjective, inconsistent and often set goals that conflict with each other. Less than 3% of BlackRock\u2019s investments in America are esg-related, but Fink has made himself the face of the movement since 2016, when he began urging the chief executives of the companies in BlackRock\u2019s portfolio, in increasingly strident terms, to make their businesses more sustainable."

From the inception, Fink put risk management at its core, bringing in mathematical experts and computer whizzkids to calculate the repayment probabilities of individual loans in a bond portfolio and assess how their value would be affected by changes in interest rates. Eventually, the software would be so successful that BlackRock would license it to 130,000 financial-services firms."

Hugh Frater, one of the co-founders, concedes that Fink was a \u201cbit of a yeller\u201d in the early days, but also recalls how he would ask, \u201cDo you want a bagel?\u201d as a peace offering. He can be solicitous. Ex-colleagues say he has helped to arrange hospital treatment for their family members, supported their book projects and provided money for their startups. Barbara Novick, one of two women co-founders, says Fink was \u201cvery supportive and open\u201d about maternity leave before it was customary. But the informality could also become incestuous. For years, several people say, the company turned a blind eye to office romances, even those between bosses and their subordinates.

His annual letters to ceos of firms in BlackRock\u2019s portfolios \u2013 which because of their size meant almost all of the big ones \u2013 attracted widespread media attention.

Months after the Paris agreement in 2015, in which governments committed themselves to limiting global warming to less than two degrees above pre-industrial times by 2100, Fink used his annual letter to invoke esg for the first time, saying BlackRock expected companies to incorporate environmental and social considerations into their discussions with boards.
