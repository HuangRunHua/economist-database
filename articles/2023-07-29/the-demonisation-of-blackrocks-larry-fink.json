A columnist for the New York Post wrote, tongue-in-cheek, that \u201cit made me wonder whether this dude was about to assign a hit squad to come to my house.\u201d Beneath the advertisement was a question and a website url. Both asked \u201cWho is Larry Fink?\u201d"

He is the 70-year-old chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager. It invests trillions of dollars on behalf of its clients, which include pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies. The firm, with a market value of about $100bn, is the world leader in innovative low-cost investment funds. Its assets under management, valued at $9.4trn, include stakes in about 18,000 listed companies across the Western world. When Fink talks, people listen \u2013 and Fink certainly likes to talk."

These days though, it looks more like a hit squad for a clique within the Republican Party. Historically, Republicans have allied themselves with business to oppose government regulation and promote free enterprise. But in recent years a faction has remonstrated against firms that speak out on issues like climate change, lgbt rights and other subjects that they consider \u201cwoke\u201d. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida and the leading challenger to Donald Trump in next year\u2019s Republican presidential primary contest, is its most prominent advocate."

            "text": "One of the main targets of this vituperative cabal is esg: environmental, social and governance investing. A lot of esg is flim-flam. The theory behind it suggests that you can measure companies\u2019 performance on metrics other than financial returns, though the scoring systems are subjective, inconsistent and often set goals that conflict with each other. Less than 3% of BlackRock\u2019s investments in America are esg-related, but Fink has made himself the face of the movement since 2016, when he began urging the chief executives of the companies in BlackRock\u2019s portfolio, in increasingly strident terms, to make their businesses more sustainable."

This year alone, Republican lawmakers in 37 states have proposed at least 167 laws targeting esg (most have not passed). Some states have blacklisted firms like BlackRock from handling their investments. Call it defunding the climate police."

This was made clear last year when Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and conservative rabble-rouser, attacked esg at a Bitcoin conference in Miami, as Fink\u2019s face stared out of the screen behind him. \u201cesg is just a hate factory,\u201d he said. BlackRock\u2019s attempts to dampen the ire of the right have earned it the wrath of the left \u2013 as it counters criticism that it is doing too much to save the planet, the other side attacks it for doing too little."

He is an ebullient conversationalist, rhapsodising about the catch of a lifetime in March while fly-fishing in Mexico. Yet when I asked him if he would have done anything differently to avoid the backlash, he ducked the issue by questioning the value of counterfactuals. Some in his orbit told me he struggles to admit he is wrong. \u201cEveryone asks me what are the things in life that I would do differently. And I would say nothing,\u201d Fink said."

One former colleague, usually in awe of Fink\u2019s energy, was shocked to find him looking \u201csad, tired and older\u201d last year as the campaign against him heated up. Another close observer likens the treatment of Fink to that of Emmanuel Goldstein, the enemy of the state in George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d, whose image is shown on a screen and abused by viewers during a daily ritual called the \u201cTwo Minutes Hate\u201d."

Last year, BlackRock\u2019s board authorised the firm to provide him with bodyguards. For safety\u2019s sake, it obliges him to use a private jet (which he frequently did anyway, even as he promoted sustainable investments). Security cameras were installed on the farm where we met."

The company has built sophisticated computer systems to analyse the exposures of its clients\u2019 assets. You might expect the person who has led such a firm since its founding to be cool, methodical and unemotive. Yet Fink couldn\u2019t be more different. One former employee called him \u201cexceptionally intuitive\u201d. He loves shooting the breeze on the phone \u2013 he calls his wife multiple times a day \u2013 and improvises in meetings with global poobahs. Another former employee once sent Fink a text message saying he\u2019d rather be loved than respected. Fink replied, \u201cWe all would.\u201d"

In recent years, as he has jetted around the world to chew the fat with corporate clients, prime ministers and central bankers, he seems to have enjoyed his job as much for the platform it gave him as for the money it generates. Raising the banner for esg seemed to offer the opportunity to cement his importance as a financial statesman \u2013 and for BlackRock to make a killing at the same time. Instead, the experience has been chastening. To understand Larry Fink, you need to understand what went wrong."

Still, he can barely stop himself talking. I am calling him from Los Angeles, the city where he was born and lived for the first 23 years of his life.

He went to state schools, which, he says, made him the person he is. His entrepreneurialism started young. The family would visit the Mojave desert, where Larry would collect snakes (conventional pets were not allowed at home because his mother was allergic to animal hair). He developed a small business dealing in them and would post his haul to collectors across America \u2013 until some slithered out in transit. When he was 12 or 13, the fbi showed up at his parents\u2019 door. Despite the scolding, his passion for snakes continues. He can still identify a venomous one at a glance."

Fink abandoned his early passion and joined First Boston in New York, an investment bank with a wasp-y reputation. \u201cI was a freak,\u201d he tells me, chuckling at the memory. \u201cI was told I was hired because I was Jewish and Jews were smart.

Stung by the trading debacle, Fink and seven partners co-founded an asset-management company a year and a half later in 1988. Its main business was investing money from pension funds and other long-term asset holders in bonds. From the inception, Fink put risk management at its core, bringing in mathematical experts and computer whizzkids to calculate the repayment probabilities of individual loans in a bond portfolio and assess how their value would be affected by changes in interest rates. Eventually, the software would be so successful that BlackRock would license it to 130,000 financial-services firms."
