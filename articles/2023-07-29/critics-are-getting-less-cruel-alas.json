It is more pleasing yet that Virginia Woolf considered James Joyce\u2019s writing to be \u201ctosh\u201d. And surely no one can be uncheered to hear that when the critic Dorothy Parker read \u201cWinnie the Pooh\u201d she found it so full of innocent, childish whimsy that she\u2014in her own moment of whimsical spelling\u2014\u201cfwowed up\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the reader, life offers few purer pleasures than a very good, very bad review. For the writer, life offers few purer pains. After Parker, A.A. Milne never wrote another \u201cWhimsy\u201d the Pooh again; the mere word \u201cwhimsical\u201d became \u201cloathsome\u201d to him. After the \u201cdrivelling idiocy\u201d comment, Keats obligingly dropped dead. \u201cSnuffed out\u201d, Lord Byron wrote, \u201cby an article\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Literary life rarely offers such splendid spectacles today. Open book-review pages, and you are more likely to see writers describing each other and their work with such words as \u201clyrical\u201d, \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cinsightful\u201d rather than, as they once did, \u201ctiresome\u201c, \u201can idiot\u201d and a \u201cdunghill\u201d. On literary pages there is now what one writer called \u201cendemic\u201d grade inflation. An editor for BuzzFeed, a news site, even announced that its books section would not do negative book reviews at all. This was wonderful news for writers (and their mums) everywhere. It was much less good news for readers. The literary world may no longer need to mourn spurned poets; it does need to mourn the death of the hatchet job. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Few will lament it loudly. Criticism is not a noble calling: as the old saying has it, no city has ever erected a statue to a critic. But then few cities have erected statues to sewage engineers or prostate surgeons either. But they are useful, just as critics are. A well-read person might read 20 or so books a year. By contrast, 153,000 books were published last year in Britain alone, according to Nielsen BookData. That is an average of 420-odd books a day. Last year\u2019s crop included \u201cThinking About Tears: Crying and Weeping in Long-Eighteenth-Century France\u201d and \u201cIs Your Cat a Psychopath?\u201d It might be that these books all deserve epithets such as \u201cinsightful\u201d. It seems unlikely. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is an open secret in the literary world that most books are very bad indeed. It is the job of critics to fillet them, first physically (work on a books desk and your first, deeply dispiriting job will be to go through the sacks of books delivered each week) then literarily, with reviews. George Orwell, a veteran critic, knew that reviews should be brutal. He wrote, \u201cIn much more than nine cases out of ten the only objectively truthful criticism would be \u2018This book is worthless,\u2019\u201d while the only truthful review would say, \u201cThis book does not interest me in any way, and I would not write about it unless I were paid to.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Reviews are rarely so punchy. Some publications keep up the tradition of forceful criticism, but too often reviews feel like a smug inside job. Literary newspapers are particularly prone to this. They tend to be rich in reviewers called \u201cFerdinand\u201d; in words like \u201cjejune\u201d; and in headlines that read less like a promise than a threat: \u201cWhither Somalia?\u201d, \u201cStructuralism Domesticated\u201d or (the question that is on everyone\u2019s lips) \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Close Reading?\u201d Hatchet jobs, by contrast, usually opt for a less elevated style. In one notorious review the critic Philip Hensher wrote that an author was so bad \u201che could not write \u2018bum\u2019 on a wall.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Once, such zingers were common on literary pages. In the Victorian era, \u201creviews were seen as a kind of cultural hygiene, so there were high standards,\u201d says Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, a professor of English at Oxford University. Reviewers were not merely taking a swipe at an enemy but cleansing the sacred halls of literature. Not that this stopped them from mild grubbiness themselves. For example, one reviewer called a fellow writer\u2019s work \u201cfeculent garbage\u201d; the reliably robust Alfred Tennyson called yet another \u201ca louse upon the locks of literature\u201d; while John Milton (apparently having momentarily lost paradise again) described another as an \u201cunswill\u2019d hogshead\u201d."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Brandish your weapons"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fun though such excesses are, the most lethal reviews tend to be more delicate. The best bad reviews are not hatchet jobs but scalpel jobs, observes the British critic Adam Mars-Jones, \u201cbecause if it\u2019s not precise, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d The Victorians brandished scalpels too. One of the finest was wielded by George Eliot on Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s \u201cJane Eyre\u201d. \u201cI wish\u201d, Eliot wrote, \u201cthe characters would talk a little less like the heroes and heroines of police reports.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Modern reviewers rarely achieve such lethal beauty. All too often reviews are replete with filler words: \u201cdarkly funny\u201d, \u201csearing\u201d, \u201cprofound meditation\u201d. Many of these\u2014reader, be warned\u2014are euphemisms for the word \u201cboring\u201d, which is in effect forbidden on literary pages. So there is \u201cdetailed\u201d (\u201cboring\u201d); \u201cexhaustive\u201d (\u201creally boring\u201d); \u201cmagisterial\u201d (\u201cboring but by a professor, and I did not finish it so cannot criticise it\u201d). And so on. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The internet is one reason for this softening. It has altered both the economics of criticism (shrunken newspapers have fewer books pages, so editors tend to fill them with the books you should read, not the ones you should not) and the advisability of it (insults that seemed amusing blurted out in the moment pall when they echo online for eternity). The tendency to recruit specialist reviewers has not helped. If you are one of the world\u2019s two experts in early Sumerian cuneiform and you give a bad review to the other one, it might be fun for 20 minutes\u2014and regrettable for 20 years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The internet has also helped decrease anonymity. Once, most reviews were unbylined, offering reviewers the facelessness of an obscure Twitter troll. Today, most reviewers are not only named but easily searchable\u2014and insultable in return. Whereas 30 years ago, critics were \u201ctacitly encouraged to really have a go at people\u201d, now people are \u201cterrified of giving offence\u201d lest a Twitter pile-on follow, says D.J. Taylor, a writer and critic."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There have been attempts to revive sharp criticism. In 2012 an award called the \u201cHatchet Job of the Year\u201d was launched by two critics (including one who now works at The Economist) as a \u201ccrusade against dullness, deference and lazy thinking\u201d. It ran for three years. Fleur Macdonald, one of its co-founders, thinks that \u201cthe literary scene probably needs it more than ever now,\u201d but that it would struggle to revive and get sponsorship since \u201cbad book reviews are controversial.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The hatchets do still come out occasionally, not for first books or those by unknown authors (it is considered pointless and cruel) but for writers famous enough to attack. Prince Harry\u2019s \u201cSpare\u201d was almost universally panned. This can be agonising for writers. Anthony Powell, a novelist, believed people were either \u201cfans\u201d or \u201cshits\u201d, while one of the most famous poems of the Roman writer Catullus is a riposte to critics who accused him of being effeminate. \u201cPedicabo ego vos et irrumabo,\u201d he wrote, which means (broadly speaking): \u201cI will sodomise and face-fuck you.\u201d Not the sort of thing you see in the Times Literary Supplement these days."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And so the blades glint less. But they should still glint occasionally. What can be forgotten is that the real market for reviews is not the critic or the author. It is the reader. And they still want to know, says Mr Taylor, \u201cwhether they ought to spend \u00a315.99 on a book.\u201d The critic has \u201ca duty\u201d to tell the truth. Besides, if the writer doesn\u2019t like it, they are, after all, a writer. They can, as Catullus did, respond. Though they might decide to go light on the profanity if they want to get published in BuzzFeed. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 55}
