One idea is to restrict pools to families with children during peak hours. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fights at pools are nothing new, but the frequency and violence have risen lately. In the past four weeks Eric Voss of the German society for bathing culture has tallied around 20 brawls or assaults in Germany\u2019s 2,800 public outdoor pools. Some stem from cultural clashes between immigrant groups or residual frustration from pandemic lockdowns. A new factor is high inflation that has made vacation trips unaffordable. \u201cWe have all become more thin-skinned and more selfish,\u201d says Peter Harzheim, Germany\u2019s head lifeguard."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What to do? Mr Harzheim favours video surveillance, guards and requiring bathers to sign in with an ID (which recently became mandatory in Berlin). He also thinks crimes at pools need to be punished faster.
