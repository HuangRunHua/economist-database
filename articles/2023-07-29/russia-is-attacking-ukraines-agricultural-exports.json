The resulting leap in grain prices, Mr Guterres warned, would leave many hungry. This week Russia landed blows of a more literal sort on Ukraine\u2019s grain exports, bombing the ports around Odessa from which they are shipped."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A volley of missiles against wharves near the city centre on the night of July 22nd was so indiscriminate it hit one of the city\u2019s cathedrals.

And on July 24th Russia targeted Reni, a port on the Danube river (not covered by the agreement) through which Ukraine had been exporting grain via Romania.

Exports by land have also caused grain prices to slump in neighbouring countries, infuriating farmers in otherwise friendly places such as Poland."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Before the war agriculture accounted for more than 10% of Ukraine\u2019s gdp and nearly 15% of employment.
