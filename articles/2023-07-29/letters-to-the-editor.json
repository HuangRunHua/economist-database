You present pro and con arguments for the money that national governments spend to build or retain a manufacturing base, but the con wins every bout. This projects more certainty in your theory and less on the reality of trade-offs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Economics teaches us that it is rare to find a high-stakes policy decision that has no trade-offs. Or more precisely, decisions where there are no trade-offs are not even debated because the answer is self-evident. America has recently come around to implementing an industrial policy after trying the alternatives over many decades and finding them somewhat disastrous. It could be that America has learned the wrong lesson from decades of lost industrial capacity and leadership in core sectors. But I\u2019m not so convinced. Pursuing industrial policy has substantial risks. Forswearing industrial policy has equally many risks, especially when our chief economic and strategic competitors are currently using it to great effect.

First, you overlook a central aspect of initiatives promoting manufacturing. It is not about establishing the superiority of one sector over another, but rather recognising their inter-dependencies and the relevance of all sectors for a healthy economy. As Professor Ha-Joon Chang, a South Korean economist, points out, countries with strong manufacturing industries also have strong service industries (although the reverse is not necessarily true)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Second, productivity and value-add are significant factors. Manufacturing has been the primary driver of productivity growth in economies where it accounts for more than 20% of GDP. Between 1998 and 2017, it accounted for almost half of the aggregate labour productivity growth in Taiwan; roughly a third in Korea and China; and a quarter in Germany. Moreover, Singapore\u2019s remarkable GDP per person, comparable to America and Britain, can be attributed to its impressive share of high-value-added services (approximately 25% of GDP) and sustained manufacturing contribution (around 20%, equivalent to Japan and Germany)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Finally, there is clear evidence showing that a growth in manufacturing also contributes to narrowing regional inequalities within countries. By comparison, knowledge-intensive services, such as professional, scientific and technical activities and finance and insurance, are among the largest regional disparities."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indeed, as your headline says, there is a manufacturing delusion, but it does not stem from succumbing to a manufacturing fetishism.

The American system of political appointment reflects the basic democratic notion that the people should get what they vote for. Since the days of Andrew Jackson (Mr Trump\u2019s spiritual predecessor) we have charged loyalists of the president with carrying out his mandate. Because both political parties doubt that the bureaucracy (or \u201cdeep state\u201d) can do this, we have political appointments down to the executive branch\u2019s mid-levels."}, {"role": "body", "text": "My advice to the Trump planners is to get their people into appointed jobs before they deal with civil servants at lower levels. This was the great mistake of 2017-21. Mr Trump was much better at firing than hiring. The result was a hollow government run by\u2014guess who?\u2014civil servants. Able appointees in previous Republican administrations learned that the bureaucracy can be led and even trusted if properly motivated. The typical civil servant (or military officer or career diplomat) knows who won the prior election and wants new direction.
