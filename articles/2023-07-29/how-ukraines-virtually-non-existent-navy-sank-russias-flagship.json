This solitary speck of land, known as Snake Island, had strategic value beyond its size. If it were captured, the Russian navy would dominate the west of the Black Sea and threaten Ukraine\u2019s coast. Snake Island housed a radar station and was garrisoned by a few dozen Ukrainian marines and border guards \u2013 no match for Russian ships."

The two countries continued to share naval bases and there were even cases of brothers serving on different sides. Relations between the cohabiting fleets shifted according to the politics of the day, becoming more strained in the aftermath of Ukraine\u2019s Orange revolution in 2004 and warmer when Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian president, came to power in 2010.

A readiness report, briefly posted online in early 2022 before being removed from the internet, showed that many systems were broken or not fully functional. \u201cAll her major weapons systems had gripes,\u201d said Carlson on a podcast last year. Moreover, the Moskva\u2019s radar and targeting tools were not entirely automated and relied heavily on well-trained operators. But over half the ship\u2019s crew, which numbered 500, were conscripts who served only a year. In consequence, the sailors \u201chad extremely limited training which would be considered woefully insufficient by Western standards,\u201d said Carlson. \u201cThe Moskva was not properly prepared to be doing combat operations.\u201d This was yet another example of complacency by the Russian armed forces that has been evident throughout the war.

They were taken captive and held in prison in Crimea before being transferred to a prison in Belograd, a city near the border with Ukraine. Conditions were brutal. Temperatures fell to -20\u00b0C, yet the prisoners were housed in tents for the first few days. Frequently, they were interrogated, beaten and electrocuted. They had no news of the outside world, beyond the names of the cities captured by the Russians, with which the guards taunted them."

Ukraine has limited stocks of Neptunes but the Danes and Americans are supplying Harpoon missiles, which are similar to the Neptune but carry a bigger warhead. Previously, Neizhpapa admitted, this kind of weapon and support would have been a \u201cdream\u201d."

In June 2022 Ukraine retook Snake Island and the Russian Black Sea Fleet withdrew towards Crimea, leaving the Ukrainian coast safe from amphibious assault. Turkey and the United Nations were able to broker a deal to allow ships into Ukrainian ports to export grain. \u201cNow,\u201d said Neizhpapa, \u201cthey keep their ships outside of the range of our cruise missiles\u201d \u2013 even state-of-the-art frigates that are armed up to the gunwales."

Neizhpapa pointed out an area of 25,000 square kilometres where neither the Russians nor Ukrainians can now operate freely. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain kind of status quo that we need to take over,\u201d he said. Neizhpapa maintains that the only way to secure peace in the Black Sea is to throw the Russians out of Crimea. \u201cIn imperial times, all of the emperors always said that whoever controls Crimea controls the Black Sea. In Soviet times, they called Crimea the aircraft-carrier that cannot be sunk. Nothing has changed since then.\u201d"
