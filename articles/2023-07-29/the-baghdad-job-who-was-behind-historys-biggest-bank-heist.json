There was a chance someone might kill him for its contents."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kanber wasn\u2019t used to acting as though he were in a spy film. A 49-year-old consultant with a passion for digital banking, he was born in Iraq but had spent much of his adulthood in Stockholm. He led a quiet, orderly life there: working, going to the gym and drinking coffee. Then, last summer, Iraq\u2019s finance minister asked him to return to Baghdad and investigate rumours about a theft at Rafidain, the country\u2019s largest state-owned bank."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One particular account at Rafidain presented a tempting target to those in the know. Oil companies (and other firms operating in Iraq) are obliged to pay tax in advance when they receive a contract. The tax authority keeps these deposits in Account 60032. Firms can claim a rebate if they end up making less profit than expected but the bureaucratic hurdles are extensive. Unclaimed rebates hang around for five years before reverting to the treasury. Over time hundreds of millions of dollars accumulated in Account 60032, where they sat, alluringly. Then in mid-2022 word trickled out that huge amounts of this money were being withdrawn."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In theory the finance minister could have asked one of the country\u2019s half-dozen oversight bodies to investigate.

The document haul wasn\u2019t proof of a fraud (though the amounts were often suspiciously round numbers), but it did irrefutably show where the missing funds had gone. Around $2.5bn, an amount comparable to the country\u2019s entire health-care budget, had been diverted. It later transpired that it had been carried off in trucks in broad daylight.

Officials estimate that the quantity of money that has disappeared from the public coffers since 2003 exceeds $300bn."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Part of the reason for the extraordinary scale of corruption is the power-sharing system introduced by the Americans in 2003. The scheme, dreamt up by exiles while Saddam Hussein was still in power, divided the infrastructure of the state between parties claiming to represent each of Iraq\u2019s main religious and ethnic groups. After Saddam was overthrown these groups plundered the country\u2019s resources to spread patronage. Party bosses, many of them affiliated to militias, divided up the lucrative ministries among themselves through a process of horse- trading."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2015 popular frustration at corruption exploded into a series of protests. Thousands marched in Baghdad against the \u201cthieves\u201d in charge. The prime minister at the time, Haider al-Abadi, decided to appoint technocrats as ministers in an attempt to mollify the protesters. But the factions didn\u2019t plan on relinquishing control; instead they found posts in government departments for their lackeys, who then bribed and bullied the ministers. In such circumstances, there is little incentive for anyone to stay honest. \u201cYour life is going to be threatened anyway, so you might as well be corrupt and make money,\u201d explained Suha Najjar, who worked for a government body until threats forced her to flee the country last November. \u201cThat\u2019s why everyone is corrupt.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "On paper, Iraq is a rich country.

He then corrected himself and admitted it was a \u201cdark\u201d reality that Jubori had been appointed. He presented himself as a passive victim of circumstance. Yet he had been the prime minister, and for most of his tenure remained head of the country\u2019s intelligence service as well. He must have had some power, and had at least an inkling about what was going on. I tried again. Hadn\u2019t his security apparatchiks smoothed Zuheir\u2019s path through the airport?

It wasn\u2019t that much money, he insisted, compared with the hundreds of billions lost to corruption since 2003.

The plane dropped the politician in Amman and Zuheir flew on to Beirut, my source said. Kadhimi wrote back categorically denying the claim, which he said was \u201cbaseless\u201d.

An Iraqi researcher in Washington had compiled a short dossier of unverified material on Kadhimi, Kanber and others. It implied they were part of a network that had \u201cenabled\u201d the heist. According to the dossier, Kanber was not quite the outsider I\u2019d taken him for \u2013 his stepfather was Kadhimi\u2019s mentor. The dossier suggested that Kanber had played a role in the appointment of the director-general of Rafidain bank shortly before the heist.

He seemed genuinely worried about his safety if he ever went back to Iraq, which wouldn\u2019t bother someone with powerful friends. (\u201cI\u2019m a tissue. They\u2019ll throw me out like this,\u201d he said, flicking his wrist.) But the interview didn\u2019t dispel my sense that there was a lot about him I didn\u2019t know.
