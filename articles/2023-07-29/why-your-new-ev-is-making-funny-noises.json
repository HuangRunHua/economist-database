Near-silent battery power and snazzy infotainment systems have provided an aural void\u2014and a high-tech way to fill it.

Artificial-noise generation offers a flavour of the past in the cars of the future. Many evs can blast passengers with fake engine noises just as the engine sound of cars has long been tweaked and tuned in sportier models to sound more raucous in the cabin than on the road.

Meanwhile, regulators in America and Europe insist that evs emit noises to let pedestrians know they are approaching (the 500e\u2019s warning is a strumming guitar)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some companies, like Mercedes-Benz, leave these acoustic signals to in-house technicians.
