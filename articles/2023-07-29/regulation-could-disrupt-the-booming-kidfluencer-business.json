Back at the family home in Houston, Texas, the toddler opens the box and plays with his new toy. It\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary. But it helped make the Kajis millionaires.

Eight years, many toy unboxings and 35m subscribers later, \u201cRyan\u2019s World\u201d, as the channel is now known, is considered YouTube royalty.

Most social-media sites require users to be over 13, but parents or guardians can create and run accounts on behalf of their children. Kid creators speak to other kids in their videos: they play make-believe with friends and family, show off new toys and give tutorials on dancing and hand-washing. A survey in 2020 by Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, found that 81% of American parents with a child aged three to four allowed their children to watch YouTube.
