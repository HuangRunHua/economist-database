Though the phrase \u201cmeteoric rise\u201d is common, meteors are better known for falling. Prices are said to \u201cspike\u201d even when their rise is not accompanied by a descent. And when people talk about \u201cwaves\u201d sweeping Europe, they often forget a crucial feature: waves break. That seems to have been what happened to the wave of nationalist populism that failed to sweep into Spain in the general election on July 23rd. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The election was expected to hand power to a coalition of the centre-right People\u2019s Party (PP) and, for the first time in Spain\u2019s modern democratic history, the hard right, in the shape of a ten-year-old party called Vox. Nationalist-populist parties already run Hungary, Poland and Italy; others share power in Sweden and Finland. Getting into government in Spain would have confirmed that Europe\u2019s populist swell was rising. Right-wingers from across the continent did their best to stir the waters. At Vox\u2019s final campaign rally at the Plaza de Col\u00f3n in Madrid (a favourite spot for nationalists, featuring the biggest national flag in Spain), Poland\u2019s Mateusz Morawiecki, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni appeared in videos cheering the party on. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Instead, Vox lost 19 of its 52 deputies. The PP came first, but even with Vox it lacks a majority, and no other party will join any coalition that includes the populists. The governing left-wing bloc headed by Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the Socialist prime minister, won fewer seats, and can reach a majority only by including a gaggle of regional separatists. Spain may have to hold new elections. The wave turned out to be one of those monsters that build far offshore, only to crash early. Why?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The reasons lie below the surface. Superficially, Vox shares many of the common bugaboos of Europe\u2019s right: feminism and gender identity, demographic decline, immigration and the \u201creligion\u201d of climate change. Yet until recently it was unusual in rarely bashing the EU. Spain has profited so handsomely from its membership since 1986\u2014rising living standards, good roads, high-speed rail\u2014that running against Europe seemed suicidal. In this campaign, though, Santiago Abascal, Vox\u2019s leader, switched the formula. The party platform denounces Brussels bureaucrats whom \u201cno one elected\u201d and calls for subordinating EU law to Spain\u2019s (impossible under the bloc\u2019s treaties). The profile of Jorge Buxad\u00e9, a Vox MEP and former member of the fascist Falange party, rose during the campaign. This scared some voters away."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The weakness of the ultranationalists in Spain, and in next-door Portugal, is often attributed to the living memory of far-right dictatorships that ended only in the mid-1970s. With those dictators gone, attitudes in Spain and Portugal changed faster than in almost any other European countries. In a survey in 2021, Spanish support for gay marriage was the third-highest in the EU, after only Sweden and the Netherlands. Portugal has the most liberal drug laws in Europe. Both countries\u2019 nationalist parties have grown in recent years. But they are nowhere near the 30% that went to Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour in the first round of France\u2019s presidential election last year, the 35% taken by hard-right parties in Italy\u2019s latest election or the roughly 20% each in Sweden and Finland. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "What seems to best explain the surge and then recession of Vox is a factor entirely specific to Spain: the question of Catalan independence. Vox\u2019s first big moment came after Catalonia\u2019s separatist leaders staged an unconstitutional independence referendum in 2017. That infuriated huge numbers of Spaniards in other regions, not all of them conservative. Vox, which advocates abolishing Spain\u2019s devolution of extensive powers to its regions, was perfectly placed to take advantage. Since then the independence question has receded from the headlines, in part because Mr S\u00e1nchez has deftly cut deals with separatist parties. That may have done more to undercut Vox than anything else. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile, other wavelets that could have joined a big populist splash are instead petering out. The decade-long fragmentation of Spain\u2019s politics, in which the two big traditional parties lost ever more voters to shiny new ones, has gone into reverse. Podemos, a far-left outfit born during the global financial crisis, is a shadow of its former self; it had to join another leftist grouping, Sumar, to survive the election. The combined vote share won by the PP and the Socialists, which had fallen to 45% in April 2019, recovered to 65%. Portugal, too, has social-democratic and conservative parties in decent nick: they won 70% of the vote last year.

In France, the two parties that have dominated the Fifth Republic since 1958 came in fifth and tenth in the presidential elections. In Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany is polling ahead of each of the three parties in the current government. Conservative politicians in Germany and in the Netherlands are now talking cautiously about breaking the taboo against working with the hard right. And although Spain shows that fragmentation is not irreversible, its return to the centre has left the PP and Socialists almost evenly matched. Neither can assemble a majority without parties that infuriate many Spaniards: Catalan and Basque separatists on the left, Vox on the right. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "They could, of course, do what the Germans, Dutch and Danes have done in recent years and form a grand coalition. Spaniards say they want the big parties to work together. But the country has no such tradition, and there is much bad blood between the big two. Having dodged a metaphorical populist wave, Spain\u2019s politicians would love to spend the next few weeks at the beach catching some literal ones. Instead they will have to sort out whether to cobble together a flimsy coalition, to vote yet again\u2014probably around Christmas, so ruining another holiday season\u2014or to listen to the majority who want the centre to hold.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Charlemagne, our columnist on European politics: A spat in Brussels pits an open vision of Europe against an insular one (Jul 19th)Farewell, Mark Rutte, the Tiggerish Dutch prime minister (Jul 13th)The burning of the banlieues (Jul 5th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Charlemagne column got its name"}], "id": 31}
