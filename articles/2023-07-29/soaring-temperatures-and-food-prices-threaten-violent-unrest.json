Each upheaval has its own causes, but certain factors make disturbances more likely everywhere. Surging temperatures, rising food prices and cuts to public spending\u2014three of the strongest predictors of turmoil\u2014have driven estimates of the potential for unrest to unprecedented highs in recent months. These estimates will probably rise higher still this summer. Temperatures are unlikely to have peaked. Russia\u2019s exit from the Black Sea Grain Initiative to export supplies from Ukraine and India\u2019s recent ban on rice exports may raise the price of staples.

Our rough calculations, which extrapolate the relationship indicated in the Science study, suggest that record temperatures in June and July could have raised the global risk of violent social unrest by somewhere in the region of 50%. The effects of El Ni\u00f1o, a weather pattern that brings warmer temperatures worldwide and recently got under way, are likely to produce a scorching end to the northern summer and start to the southern summer.

According to the firm\u2019s estimates, the risk of global social unrest in the third quarter of 2023 is the highest since the index was created in 2017. That is because of both heat and the higher cost of living, says Jimena Blanco, the firm\u2019s lead analyst. \u201cHigh rates of food price inflation are a particular risk,\u201d she warns."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Global inflation seems to have passed a peak, and international grain prices are lower than last year\u2019s high. But that does not mean prices paid by consumers have stopped rising. In June annual food-price inflation was 17% in Britain, 14% in the eu and nearing 10% in Canada and Japan. It is higher still in many developing economies, especially those in Africa.

But Russia\u2019s choice to scupper the Black Sea Grain Initiative on July 17th, which was followed by four nights of attacks on the Ukrainian ports of Chornomorsk and Odessa in the Black Sea, has disturbed food markets, pushing prices in the opposite direction. Dry conditions elsewhere are also likely to exacerbate difficulties. Yields of Australian barley and wheat are forecast to decline by 34% and 30% this harvest. Stocks of American maize, wheat and sorghum are down by 6%, 17% and 51%. Last year these countries were the world\u2019s two biggest exporters of the cereals by value."}, {"role": "body", "text": "More concerning still are events in India, which produces roughly 40% of global rice exports, and has suffered from debilitating rains this year. On July 20th the government responded by banning exports of all non-Basmati rice from the country. This will reduce global rice exports by about 10%, with almost immediate effect. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that together maize, rice and wheat provide more than two-fifths of the world\u2019s calorific intake. Among the world\u2019s poorest populations, the figure may rise to four-fifths. If prices do not start to fall soon, people will only get hungrier.

Many governments have committed to raising taxes or cutting expenditures in order to bring debt under control after lavish spending during covid-19.

By contrast, 18 months after a major episode of unrest a country\u2019s gdp remains 1% lower. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Countries beyond the rich world have a more concerning outlook. The damage done by unrest is about twice as large in emerging markets as in advanced economies, according to the imf researchers, with lower business and consumer confidence, and heightened uncertainty, exacerbating the much greater risk of sudden capital flight.
