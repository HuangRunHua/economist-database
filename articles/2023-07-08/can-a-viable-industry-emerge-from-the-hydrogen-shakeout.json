Governments, especially those elected by increasingly climate-conscious Western societies, are trying to help lift the industry into existence with generous subsidies.

Extracting the stuff from those molecules requires energy and can itself emit carbon\u2014either because stripping hydrogen from hydrocarbons leaves carbon behind or because hydrocarbons are burned to power the splitting process. Today huge quantities of dirty hydrogen are produced from natural gas, primarily for use in making ammonia, a compound of hydrogen and nitrogen that is the main ingredient in artificial fertilisers."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230708_WBC727.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "To clean things up, any carbon released in making hydrogen from hydrocarbons would need to be mopped up and stored.

The environmentally superior alternative is to crack water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity that is carbon-free, from either renewable sources (\u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen, in the sector\u2019s colour-coded lingo) or nuclear power (\u201cpink\u201d hydrogen)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cleaning things up is, though, costly\u2014and getting more so as rising interest rates raise capital-intensive hydrogen projects\u2019 costs.

Beno\u00eet Potier, chairman of Air Liquide, a French industrial-gas giant, says his firm\u2019s planned 200 megawatt (MW) mega-project for making green hydrogen in Normandy is all set to go but cannot secure a large-enough power-purchase agreement for renewables (though a pink version may go ahead by tapping into France\u2019s plentiful nuclear power).

In Puertollano, an hour by train from Madrid, Iberdrola, a Spanish energy giant, runs a 20MW electrolyser, one of the world\u2019s biggest machines of its kind, using power from its local solar farm. A fertiliser plant next door pays for the clean hydrogen, which replaces the dirtier kind it previously used to make ammonia.

It is increasingly clear that hydrogen makes much more sense in some areas than others. RMI, an American think-tank, calculates the emission-reduction potential of low-carbon hydrogen in a variety of sectors and finds that electrification is a much better choice in passenger cars, which fuelled the brief hydrogen boom 20 years ago, or home heating. A review of 32 studies published in the journal Joule also found that heating homes with hydrogen is less efficient and more resource-intensive than using electrical heat pumps."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Instead, argues Martin Tengler of BloombergNEF, a research firm, the right place to start is by supplying clean hydrogen to sectors that already use dirty hydrogen today, such as in ammonia for fertiliser, methanol for the chemicals industry and oil refining. Perhaps 100m tonnes a year of it is made today from fossil fuels for this purpose. Next, it makes sense to promote hydrogen in areas where few decarbonisation alternatives exist, like steelmaking, shipping and long-term energy storage (where batteries\u2019 tendency to lose charge makes them less useful)\u2014not least because deep-pocketed incumbents in those industries also bring talent, money and business skills that the hydrogen economy needs. In May Felipe Arbelaez of BP, an oil giant pushing into hydrogen, told the World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam that the sector\u2019s efforts should first go after industrial applications, which he said were \u201cmuch easier than, say, using hydrogen for heating homes\u201d.

Europe took an early lead in kick-starting the industry. The EU\u2019s latest climate package promotes the use of hydrogen in hard-to-decarbonise industries. Its plans to more than halve greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 include ambitious targets for hydrogen produced using renewable energy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "America, for its part, is splurging billions of dollars on subsidies. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is drawing up the final eligibility criteria for a handout of up to $3 per kilogram for clean hydrogen.

A handful of other countries with similar competitive advantages, from Australia and Norway to Chile and Saudi Arabia, are also promoting the industry.

If written too strictly, the upcoming American eligibility criteria could throttle investment and, worries Andy Marsh, Plug Power\u2019s chief executive, hinder the hydrogen industry for years. If handed out too freely, meanwhile, for example by allowing unlimited amounts of fossil-intensive grid electricity to power electrolysers, subsidies could do more harm than good. Analysis from Princeton University suggests that hydrogen made from water with dirty power could generate more greenhouse gases than hydrogen made directly from fossil fuels.

Despite a recent turn to electric vehicles, Toyota has not pulled the plug on passenger cars equipped with hydrogen fuel cells, which look unlikely to be competitive with battery-powered wheels. Siemens Energy, a German engineering giant, plans to start making electrolysers at a big new factory in Berlin soon but for now workers are still mostly assembling conventional turbines capable of being modified to burn hydrogen instead of natural gas. The domestic gas industry has persuaded the British government to encourage trials of hydrogen for home heating, prompting one lobbyist to crow: \u201cChristmas has arrived early, hydrogen friends!\u201d Money spent on dubious applications leaves less for the vital ones in genuine need of support.
