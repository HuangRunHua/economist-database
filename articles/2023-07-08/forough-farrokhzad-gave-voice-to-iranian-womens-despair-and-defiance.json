Some police officers have continued to threaten women who do not cover their hair and have erected billboards stating that those forgoing the hijab are dishonouring their families.

She was born into a strict military family in Tehran in 1934; at the age of 16 she married a distant, much older relative and had a son. In 1954 the couple divorced and, in accordance with the law at that time, she lost custody of the child. Farrokhzad released her first collection of poetry, \u201cAsir\u201d (\u201cThe Captive\u201d), the following year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her work offered provocative explorations of lust; the verses are shot through with religious language. \u201cWeary of divine asceticism,\u201d she wrote, \u201cin the middle of the night in Satan\u2019s bed/I\u2019d seek refuge in the slopes of a fresh sin.\u201d Elsewhere sex and artistic inspiration are entwined: \u201cYou kindled my passionate desire/Thus setting my poems afire.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Farrokhzad saw that the repression of women was having a stultifying effect. Poets such as Rumi had imagined Persia as a thriving garden, yet she saw her country as \u201cdying\u201d and \u201cwaiting for rain\u201d. In her final and most widely read collection, \u201cTavalodi Digar\u201d (\u201cAnother Birth\u201d, 1964), a blistering poem attacked self-satisfied elites who \u201csuckle on our past glory\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She released only four collections of poetry during her short life: she died in 1967, aged 32, in a car accident. Her work was potent enough to cause consternation more than a decade later, during the Islamic revolution of 1979. Religious clerics banned the dissemination of her poetry and, when Farrokhzad\u2019s publisher refused to stop, he was thrown in jail.
