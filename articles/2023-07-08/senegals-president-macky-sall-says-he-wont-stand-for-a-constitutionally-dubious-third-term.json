That ended years of speculation over whether Macky Sall would seek a constitution-bending third term in next year\u2019s election. It also assuaged fears of more bloody clashes if he did. Alioune Tine of Afrikajom Centre, a think-tank in Dakar, the capital, echoed the feelings of many Senegalese democrats: \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling of deliverance.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Violent protests against Mr Sall began in March 2021 when Ousmane Sonko, a prominent opposition leader, was accused of rape and later arrested. Many protesters believed that Mr Sall was targeting political rivals and wanted to run for a third term. Last month protests spiralled after Mr Sonko was sentenced to two years in prison for \u201ccorruption of youth\u201d, which almost certainly rules him out of the election. At least 37 people have been killed in protests since 2021, many of them shot by security forces, says Amnesty International, a rights group. The fate of Mr Sonko, who is not yet behind bars, could cause ructions. But Mr Sall\u2019s decision greatly reduces the risk of violence.

In Ivory Coast, west Africa\u2019s other Francophone pillar, President Alassane Ouattara is serving a third term based on a dubious twist of the constitution. Indeed, of all mainland Francophone Africa\u2019s countries, arguably only Senegal can boast that it is genuinely democratic. It has largely free elections, a record of transferring power between opposing parties, and (still) resilient constitutional limits. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A bevy of global bigwigs was quick to laud the decision. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN head, wrote of his \u201cdeep appreciation for President Macky Sall and the statesmanship he has shown\u201d. Many Senegalese are less gushing. \u201cIt\u2019s not him that decided to leave, it\u2019s the population that decided for him,\u201d says Ousmane Diouf, an ex-soldier, alluding to the protests. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Plenty of locals believe Mr Sall should never have needed to make his declaration. \u201cYou do two terms and leave. That\u2019s how it is,\u201d says Souleymane, a 27-year-old watchman. Mr Sall has only ever presided under a constitution that sets the limit at two terms. Yet he has implausibly claimed\u2014and did so again in his speech\u2014that he was permitted to stand for a third term, arguing that a tweak to the constitution in 2016 to reduce terms from seven years to five had reset the count on the number of mandates.
