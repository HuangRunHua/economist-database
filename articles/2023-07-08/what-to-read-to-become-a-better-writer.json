For many of us writing is a slog. Words drip with difficulty onto the page\u2014and frequently they seem to be the wrong ones, in the wrong order. Yet few pause to ask why writing is hard, why what we write may be bad, or even what is meant by \u201cbad\u201d. Fortunately for anyone seeking to become a better writer, the works recommended here provide enlightenment and reassurance. Yes, writing is hard. But if you can first grasp the origins and qualities of bad writing, you may learn to diagnose and cure problems in your own prose (keeping things simple helps a lot). Similarly heartening is the observation that most first drafts are second-rate, so becoming a skilled rewriter is the thing. These five works are excellent sources of insight and inspiration."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Politics and the English Language. By George Orwell.

Published in 1946, this polemic against poor and perfidious writing will be familiar to many. But its advice on how to write is as apposite now as then. (Besides, it is short and free.) Orwell analyses the unoriginal, \u201cdying\u201d metaphors that still haunt the prose of academics, politicians, professionals and hacks. He lambasts the \u201cmeaningless words\u201d and \u201cpretentious diction\u201d of his day; many of the horrors he cites remain common. To save writers from regurgitating these, Orwell proposes six now-canonical rules. The first five boil down to: prefer short, everyday words and the active voice, cut unneeded words and strive for fresh imagery. The sixth\u2014\u201cbreak any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous\u201d\u2014displays the difficulty of pinning down something as protean as language. But this has not stopped others trying."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace. By Joseph M. Williams and Joseph Bizup.

(Aptly for a text about rewriting, it is the latest in a long line of reworkings of Williams\u2019s teachings on the subject, which appeared under various titles.) Unlike Orwell, who devised high-level rules for writers to wield by instinct, Williams proposes nuanced \u201cprinciples\u201d and shows how to apply them. Whereas, for instance, Orwell exhorted writers to \u201cnever use the passive where you can use the active\u201d, Williams explains how passives can sometimes help create a sense of flow. This forms part of his coverage of \u201ccohesion\u201d and \u201ccoherence\u201d, which could upend the way you write. Insightful, too, is Williams\u2019s guidance on pruning prose and on the ills and virtues of nominalisations\u2014nouns formed from verbs (as \u201cnominalisation\u201d is from \u201cnominalise\u201d), which often send sentences awry.

He embraces slippery subjects like \u201crhythm\u201d and \u201cvoice\u201d that tend to defy rules or principles.

The celebrated psycholinguist argues that \u201cthe curse of knowledge\u201d is the biggest cause of bad writing: like children, writers forget that others often do not know what they know. Bad writers tend to dwell on irrelevant points and make logical connections that are logical only to them. Their prose\u2014the type beloved of academics, bureaucrats and businessfolk\u2014abounds in abstract nouns and luxuriates in long sentences. By contrast, good writing (\u201cclassic style\u201d, in Mr Pinker\u2019s phrase) assembles concrete words into straightforward sentences that readers find simple to grasp. Why should this be so? Using striking and funny examples, Mr Pinker shows how working memory, which stores syntactic constructions until they are complete, is easily swamped.
