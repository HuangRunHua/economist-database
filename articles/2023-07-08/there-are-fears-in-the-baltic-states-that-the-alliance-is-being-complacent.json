Less than an hour\u2019s drive to the east sprawls the Russian satrapy of Belarus, home now not just to Russian tactical nuclear weapons but soon, perhaps, to a large, seasoned Russian mercenary army under restaurauteur-cum-rebel-warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin. Just 150km to the west, bristling with combat planes, missiles and warships, lies the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. Closer than either, for older Lithuanians, linger memories of decades under Russian rule when their country, along with its two Baltic sisters, Estonia and Latvia, formed unwilling \u201crepublics\u201d within the Soviet Union. Russia\u2019s grinding war against nearby Ukraine, yet another former colony, brings those memories alive for younger people, too. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But as Vilnius braces for a NATO summit on July 11th and 12th that will temporarily swell its population with thousands of soldiers, police, officials and journalists as well as 31 heads of state or government, it is not physical danger that makes locals nervous. The fear across the three Baltic states, perhaps the alliance\u2019s most enthusiastic members, is that their bigger partners will fail to rise to the occasion. \u201cWe have proved that we can stay united in the face of a huge challenge, and we have been strong in support of Ukraine,\u201d says Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cBut now is the time to seal this politically, and really strengthen the alliance.\u201d "}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230708_EUM957.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The anxiety is understandable. Historical experience, plus proximity to a belligerent Russian regime under Vladimir Putin, put the Baltics far ahead of the curve on Ukraine. Instead of waiting for Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion to act, the Baltic trio took sharp note of looming dangers way back in 2014 when Mr Putin made his first grabs at Ukraine\u2019s Crimea and Donbas regions. Lithuania and, later, Latvia reintroduced conscription. Lithuania doubled and then tripled defence spending. All three unhitched themselves from Russian energy supplies. They successfully lobbied for bigger allies to pre-position small numbers of troops and supplies on their territory. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet their calls for stronger military deterrents, as well as for measures to protect European economies, were largely ignored in Berlin, Brussels and Paris. When Russian tanks rolled towards Kyiv in February 2022 there was little surprise in the Baltics, but rather a glum pride in being right. \u201cWe went from neurotics to experts overnight,\u201d sighs Mihkel Tikk, who directs Estonia\u2019s cyber-defence. Now that the rest of NATO has woken up to the danger, however, satisfaction in the Baltics is tempered by fear that bigger powers will waste the opportunity to put Russia back in its bottle not just temporarily, but for good. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the short term there is little doubt what people in the Baltic states most want: all three of their parliaments recently voted overwhelmingly for NATO to include Ukraine as a member. But those votes were symbolic. Although the alliance offered Ukraine a path to membership at a summit in Bucharest way back in 2008, even gung-ho Baltic officials admit it is hard to see how a country at war and under partial occupation can join NATO without instantly drawing its allies into direct combat with a nuclear-armed Russia. The best they expect from a summit declaration on this score is a more explicit commitment to Ukraine\u2019s security, and a more specific promise of eventual membership. It would be nice to have dates and waypoints, says Lithuania\u2019s Mr Landsbergis. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Further disappointment may be in store if Turkey continues to block NATO membership for Sweden, and if other countries fail to agree that a commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defence should become a baseline figure and not just a widely ignored target. Estonia is already spending close to 3%, but despite excellent training and high morale its forces remain tiny. A recent promise by Germany\u2019s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, to turn a small, rotating German force stationed in Lithuania into a permanent 4,000-strong brigade, has been widely welcomed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Privately, however, officers in the region express scepticism that such a deployment will happen soon, or even prove very effective. The massively destructive style of Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion suggests that small states on its periphery need not just defence, but deterrence. \u201cA reinforcement strategy is helpful, but what we really need is a capacity to inflict strategic paralysis at depth,\u201d says an Estonian field commander. \u201cMy capability is only at 50km range. It\u2019s not enough\u2014the Russians don\u2019t care how many men they lose, it can be 3:1 and they will still win.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Baltic officials warn against complacency on the part of NATO. \u201cThe Russians can take a lot of punishment and just wait, like the Taliban,\u201d says Marko Mihkelson, chair of the foreign-affairs committee in Estonia\u2019s parliament. Don\u2019t forget that Russia\u2019s aim was not Ukraine, but to alter Europe\u2019s security architecture, says a top Baltic diplomat. \u201cThey wanted to create a buffer between themselves and Europe, and that buffer would be us.\u201d \u25a0"}], "id": 39}
