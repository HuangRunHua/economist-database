While traditional families remain widespread, families across the region are becoming far more varied. As young people delay or eschew marriage and having children, nuclear families are in decline: in Japan, where this process began earliest, couples with at least one child accounted for 42% of households in 1980, when single-person households made up just 20%; by 2020, couples with children had fallen to 25% of households, and single people accounted for 38%.

The answer is not to strengthen its legal, social and cultural monopoly, but to remove the obstacles that make it so hard to raise children in other settings.
