For 42 years the alliance prepared for conventional and nuclear war with the Soviet Union and its allies. In 1991 the Warsaw Pact fell apart and the plans fell into abeyance.

Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, has just had his term extended for another year (the allies could not agree on a candidate to replace him). Ukraine wants an invitation to join the alliance after the war; in the meantime it expects detailed and substantial guarantees of long-term aid. A sticking-point will be Turkey\u2019s continued veto of Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO. Another will be the alliance\u2019s relationship with Asia. The allies agree that China is having an ever-larger impact on European security\u2014not least through its deepening relationship with Russia\u2014but a row over whether to open a NATO office in Tokyo reveals splits over how to respond. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Despite all this, it is the planned overhaul of NATO\u2019s military machinery that is the most consequential item on the agenda. The architect of the defence reforms is Chris Cavoli, an American general who serves as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). His job was first held by Dwight Eisenhower\u2014whose globe still sits in General Cavoli\u2019s office in the Belgian city of Mons.

Russia, unsurprisingly, is the focus, but not exclusively so: the southern plan, on Turkey\u2019s insistence, splits its attention evenly between the threat from Russia and from terrorist groups.

Another hope is that the plans will prompt reform and increase accountability. During the cold war SHAPE had a large staff that could continually test how ready national forces were for combat. This team dwindled but is growing once more: \u201cSACEUR has now got a big stick to beat nations with,\u201d says a European official. At last year\u2019s NATO summit in Madrid the allies agreed they would collectively keep over 100,000 troops ready to deploy in less than ten days, and another 200,000 on a month\u2019s readiness\u2014a far larger number of high-readiness troops than before. Just as important is that allies will now \u201cdeclare\u201d to General Cavoli which units are available at any time. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In recent weeks America, Germany and Britain have all practised how they could quickly scale up their battalion-sized deployments in Poland, Lithuania and Estonia into brigade-sized formations. Italy will probably soon run a similar test in Bulgaria. The aim of this is to assure the Baltic states, and to demonstrate to Russia, that these armies are agile enough to reinforce NATO\u2019s eastern front more quickly than Russia can mobilise for an attack. This month Germany, whose armed forces have been in poor shape over the past decade, went further. It promised that it would eventually station a whole brigade on Lithuanian soil\u2014an unprecedented commitment. NATO exercises are also becoming more demanding: they are \u201cmore or less rehearsals\u201d, says one official. The largest in decades, Steadfast Jupiter, should take place later this year. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "NATO\u2019s new plans will not only keep armies on their toes, but also set priorities for procurement and investment. Collective defence of the continent requires heavy weaponry: jets, tanks and artillery. But for years following the attacks on September 11th, 2001 the allies were fighting guerrilla wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that demanded somewhat different kinds of kit: mine-resistant vehicles, transport helicopters and light infantry. NATO did not impose any discipline on what its members purchased: \u201cWe have had no requirements on the nations that have really been enforced over the last 30 years,\u201d says General Van Wagenen. The aim is now to bring demand and supply into line again through a mechanism known as the \u201cforce structure requirement\u201d\u2014essentially, General Cavoli\u2019s list of what is needed if his military strategy is to work as it is intended to do. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A NATO bigwig points to five immediate priorities: combat-capable ground forces, particularly heavy armoured brigades; integrated air- and missile-defence systems capable of protecting units on the move; long-range firepower such as artillery and rocket launchers; digital networks that allow data to move around the battlefield and back to headquarters quickly and securely; and logistics to shunt large armies across Europe while keeping them adequately supplied. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This list largely reflects needs that have been identified while observing the war in Ukraine: old-fashioned artillery has inflicted the majority of casualties; manoeuvring without armour has proven extremely costly. The problem is that the majority of European armies fare woefully on most of these measures (notwithstanding pockets of excellence, such as Finland\u2019s artillery-rich army of conscripts). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A paper published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a think-tank in London, concludes that the number of combat battalions in some of NATO\u2019s largest armies barely changed between 2015 and 2023, despite the growing threat from Russia. France and Germany have each added one battalion\u2019s worth of forces, a piddling amount, and even Poland has added only two. Britain has lost five over that period. \u201cMost\u2026nations now can only field one full-strength brigade,\u201d laments a senior NATO general\u2014a number that would dismay any cold-war general transplanted to the present. The same is true of naval forces. Commodore Carsten Fjord-Larsen of the Danish navy laments that in 2002 his navy fielded 34 combat units. The figure is now down to five. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ammunition holdings are a serious problem. Britain \u201chas probably not got a sufficient stockpile for a heavy armoured brigade to fight an intense war\u201d, says Ben Barry, a retired brigadier now at the IISS and a co-author of the report. In private, British generals agree. Ukraine\u2019s offensive compounds the problem: every ten days that country is chewing through as many shells as America produces in a month. Countries are having to choose between keeping Ukraine solvent and maintaining their own reserves. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "The right kit"}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are also other holes. NATO has around ten corps headquarters but most are lacking in artillery, air-defence and helicopter brigades to support the divisions under their command, says Mr Barry. \u201cThe corps commander hasn\u2019t got any troops he can use to shape the deep battle.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such calculations highlight Europe\u2019s dependency on America. The Pentagon puts others to shame by positioning 22 battalion-equivalents in Europe, mostly under V Corps in Poland. That is up from six in 2015; it is roughly the same number that Britain has in total. Will it last? \u201cThe inconvenient truth for Europe is that what\u2019s currently in V Corps reflects a lot of reinforcement that took place last year,\u201d says Mr Barry. \u201cBut the overall direction of travel of US deployments is away from Europe towards the Indo-Pacific.\u201d If a crisis were to erupt in Taiwan, Europe could find itself rather worryingly exposed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And yet the new plans also draw America and Europe closer in important ways. \u201cNot many people really get this,\u201d says the NATO bigwig, \u201cbut America is coming back into the NATO planning system in a big way.\u201d For the past 20 years, he says, the United States European Command (EUCOM) in Stuttgart in Germany\u2014America\u2019s military command for the continent\u2014largely kept to itself, scribbling defence plans at a time when European armed forces were doing little detailed planning of their own. NATO\u2019s new plans are aligned with American thinking. In many ways they are products of it (General Cavoli is commander of both EUCOM and NATO). That suggests America is plugging back in\u2014despite political jitters over the possible re-election of Donald Trump next year.

A new land command to handle NATO operations north of the Alps could have been hosted by Poland or Germany, both of which were interested in the job; instead the US Army is taking on that task itself. The new command will be in General Williams\u2019 headquarters in Wiesbaden. Paradoxically, given fears of American abandonment, some Europeans fret that American generals are taking over. \u201cYes,\u201d retorts the bigwig, \u201cthey\u2019re taking the lead because they intend to fight here: that\u2019s quite good news if you\u2019re European.\u201d "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Of maps and machinery"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The new reforms are profoundly shaped by the way the alliance\u2019s membership has changed over the past 30 years.

By 2004, when the Baltic states joined NATO, its border with Russia was only 800km long. But when Finland joined on April 4th this year, that more than doubled at a stroke (see map).
