Operation Desert Storm, America\u2019s swift and easy triumph over Iraq in 1991, seemed to offer further proof of the concept.

It is two and a half British armies. More than 20,000 Russians died between December 2022 and April 2023 alone, say American sources, most of them in or around Bakhmut, a previously inconsequential town in eastern Ukraine.

Leaked American intelligence reports in late February suggest that it has suffered over 100,000 casualties itself, including more than 15,000 killed.

Many of those in the vanguard of Ukraine\u2019s current counter-offensive will have had just a few weeks of training.

But ammunition consumption has far outstripped both pre-war expectations (causing artillery barrels to melt) and production capacity, exposing gaping holes in the West\u2019s industry. \u201cMunitions are like cement,\u201d writes Jonathan Caverley of the US Naval War College. \u201cConsumers do not always need them but require massive amounts when they do.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive would be impossible without an influx of shells from South Korea."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This orgy of indecisive human and material destruction over a trench-scarred landscape is not what military technologists had in mind when they talked up the RMA.

Such rounds were \u201cdisproportionately effective\u201d, noted a study published by Mr Watling and his colleagues at RUSI, drawing on data from Ukraine\u2019s general staff.

The idea of correcting shellfire by aerial observation dates from the American civil war, when balloons were used for the job, notes Richard Barrons, a retired British general. Drones which returned film by parachute were employed from the 1970s, he says. By the 1980s these could send back data in real time, if the drone remained in the right line of sight. Now the skies are thick with them: during the battle for Bakhmut there were 50 up at any one time. Around 86% of all Ukrainian targets are derived from drones, says T.J.

This was the vision of the Soviet reconnaissance-strike complex and the RMA: a transparent and semi-automatic battlefield. Ukraine is not yet that.

If the operator spots a Russian tank, he can manually mark its location on Kropyva, a Ukrainian-built app, sharing its position with every artillery battery in the area.

Such digital links between sensors and shooters are being refined further."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Drones are collecting vast amounts of video footage, running to petabytes per hour.

It is integrated with America\u2019s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, so users can pull up images from commercial satellites (though not the most sensitive ones). This allows data streams to be combined in clever ways. A battalion might use American radio-frequency satellites to detect emissions from a Russian radar in a general area, and then send a cheap Chinese-made drone on a one-way mission to pinpoint its location.

After a sluggish start, it now uses computerised command and control to knit together drones and artillery batteries. It also has good human intelligence (ie, spies) and satellites of its own. But the war has shown that intelligence is not enough: you also have to use it well. Russia\u2019s air force failed to pick off Ukraine\u2019s air defences in the first days of fighting not just because of poor training and preparation, but because it took two days, and sometimes longer, for Russian military intelligence to send target information to a command centre in Moscow and onwards to warplanes. The targets were typically long gone by then. Even now, 16 months on, the Russian army struggles to find and strike moving targets. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ukrainian planners, in contrast, waged \u201cdata-driven combat\u201d at a level of \u201cspeed and precision that NATO has not yet achieved\u201d, concludes a report by Nico Lange, a former chief of staff at Germany\u2019s defence ministry. Sometimes that has been down to tools like Kropyva and Delta. Firms such as Palantir, an American tech company, have used cutting-edge AI to help Ukraine find high-value targets. But data-driven warfare can be quietly prosaic, too. A Ukrainian police officer explains that last year his units were locating Russian troops simply by intercepting 1,000 conversations a day (the figure is now higher). If they found a general, the details were shared in an ad hoc WhatsApp group. \u201cWe were connected to the people who were literally bombing.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This speed and precision has consequences for tactics. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight under constant observation and in constant contact,\u201d says General James Rainey, head of the US Army\u2019s Futures Command. \u201cThere is no break. There is no sanctuary.\u201d One response is to resort to century-old methods. Trenches and fortifications run for hundreds of kilometres across eastern Ukraine. Camouflage is another tactic, though it is getting harder as sensors are combined: a thermal blanket might confound an infrared camera, but radar satellites will pick up subtle tyre tracks leading to a concealed position. The best way of surviving, says RUSI, is simply to disperse and move more quickly than the enemy can spot you. Even Ukrainian special forces operating in small teams can be found by Russian drones if they stay in one place for too long."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This jeopardy is reflected in a curiously sparse battlefield. In Ukraine some 350,000 Russian troops are arrayed on a front line stretching 1,200km (750 miles)\u2014around 300 men per km and, at times last year, less than half that. That is around a tenth of the average for the same area in the second world war, notes Christopher Lawrence, head of the Dupuy Institute, which collects such data. Battalions of several hundred men fill areas that would once have been covered by brigades of a few thousand. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In theory, says Mr Lawrence, this seems a ripe environment for attackers. Thin front lines are easier to break through. And new sensors, more accurate munitions and better digital networks make it easier to find and strike targets. The catch is that attackers must concentrate their forces to pierce well-defended front lines, as Ukraine is now trying to do with its counter-offensive. And such concentrations can be detected and struck\u2014not always, but more often than in the past. \u201cAt this time,\u201d concludes Frank Hoffman of the National Defence University in Washington, \u201ca shift in favour of the defender is evident in ground warfare just as it was in the days of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, when the firepower revolution of the late 19th century made massed formations and manoeuvre prohibitively difficult.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The result is a paradox. Precision warfare can counter some advantages of mass: Ukraine was outnumbered 12 to one north of Kyiv. It can also complement mass. Software-based targeting saves around 15-30% in shells, according to sources familiar with the data. But what precision cannot do, says Michael Kofman of the Centre for Naval Analyses (CNA), a think-tank, is substitute for mass. The idea behind the Soviet reconnaissance-strike complex or America\u2019s RMA was to win by paralysing the enemy, not wearing him down. But there seems to be no escape from attrition. War on the cheap is an illusion. Many people expected Russia\u2019s invasion to be \u201ca second Desert Storm\u201d, says Andrew Krepinevich, an American defence official who pioneered the idea of the RMA in the 1990s. \u201cWhat we got was a second Iran-Iraq war.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This special report focuses on the military lessons, especially for the West, from the war.
