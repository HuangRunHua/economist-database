A paper by Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds of RUSI shows how its tactics have improved. The authors have published detailed studies of the war that are read avidly by the West\u2019s armed forces and defence ministries. Their report draws on interviews with Ukraine\u2019s general staff and its brigades. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Consider infantry tactics. Russia now sends small packets of \u201cdisposable\u201d infantry, a handful of men at a time, often under the influence of amphetamines, to \u201cskirmish\u2026until killed\u201d, exposing Ukrainian positions. Larger groups of better-trained assault infantry then move in, backed by armour, mortars and artillery. If a position is taken, it is fortified within 12 hours. \u201cThe\u2026speed with which Russian infantry dig, and the scale at which they improve their fighting positions, is noteworthy,\u201d say Mr Watling and Mr Reynolds. Russian engineers have built fortifications and bridges and laid minefields."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russian gunnery is improving. Drones can be connected to artillery batteries via the Strelets computer system, letting Ukrainian targets be struck within minutes of detection. One tactic, say the authors, \u201cis for the Russians to withdraw from a position that is being assaulted and then saturate it with fire once Ukrainian troops attempt to occupy it.\u201d Such \u201cfire pockets\u201d are one of the biggest risks to Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive. Russian tanks also make better use of camouflage. They fight at dusk and dawn when their temperature signature is less obvious. Russia\u2019s reactive armour, which explodes outward, has \u201cproven highly effective\u201d, with some tanks surviving multiple hits. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russian air defences, much derided on social media, are increasingly connected, allowing them to share data on incoming threats. They are shooting down a significant proportion of strikes by GMLRS\u2014the GPS-guided rockets, fired from American HIMARS launchers\u2014that played havoc with Russian headquarters last year. Russia has been pulling command-and-control centres farther back, dispersing and hardening them and wiring physical cables to brigades closer to the front. Meanwhile Russia\u2019s air force, an irrelevance for much of the war, is making more use of glide bombs, in which a guidance kit is fitted to older \u201cdumb\u201d munitions. That poses a growing threat to Ukrainian troops moving south. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Early in the war one masked Ukrainian soldier gained fame when he said: \u201cWe\u2019re lucky they\u2019re so fucking stupid.\u201d Russia\u2019s army is beset by problems, including poor recruitment and a lack of modern equipment. Its elite units have been decimated. It is unlikely to have serious offensive capability for the rest of this year. The recent short-lived mutiny of Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner mercenaries will not have boosted morale. Yet the army remains a formidable obstacle. \u201cThere is evidence of a centralised process for identifying shortcomings in employment and the development of mitigations,\u201d conclude the RUSI authors. Major-General Viktor Nikolyuk, in charge of army training for Ukraine, says: \u201cIt is impossible to say that the enemy does not know how to fight. We learned a lot from them, too, [on] tactics.\u201d\u25a0"}], "id": 54}
