In America, the Food and Drug Administration (fda) has approved just one of the new drugs, Wegovy, for weight loss\u2014and only for patients with a body-mass index (bmi) above certain thresholds. The cut-off is 27 for people with weight-related illnesses, and 30 otherwise. For someone 1.7 metres (5\u20197\u201d) tall, these correspond to 78kg (172lb) and 87kg.

For example, 70% of 50-year-old white women with a bmi of 30 have at least one of these conditions.
