But\u2014briefly\u2014Russians are here. A battalion from the British Army\u2019s parachute regiment plays Task Force Hannibal, a unit that mimics Russian doctrine. They face battalions from the Royal Irish and Gurkha regiments. The \u201cStorm Wessex\u201d exercise imitates conditions in Ukraine: precise firepower, the \u201cpervasive stare\u201d of sensors and jamming galore. The visual and electronic signatures of each unit are shown to commanders. In the control centre, a satellite image shows the radar-reflecting corrugated-iron roof of a defensive position: the lesson, it is better to use wood. Engine exhausts are covered to hide from infrared cameras. Voices are hushed to evade acoustic sensors. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Soldiers learn by failing. In round one a battlegroup uses high-frequency radio. The source is located and wiped out. In round two troops communicate securely. Hannibal sends a drone to investigate. The group\u2019s camouflage is sub-par and it is destroyed again. In round three the group is quiet, concealed and its sentry shoots down the drone. That is a mistake: Hannibal rains fire on its last recorded position. By round five the defenders have wised up to use decoy electronic emitters. \u201cBy doing this,\u201d says an officer, \u201cour young leaders are learning in a much more visceral way.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Western armies are busily identifying what lessons they can find from Ukraine. Every two weeks the British army collects data from the battlefield and from Wiesbaden in Germany, a hub for supporting Ukraine. A \u201cRussia-Ukraine Insights Hub\u201d led by Rear Admiral Andrew Betton has written a highly classified 70-page report. \u201cIt\u2019s reinforcing some age-old lessons,\u201d says the rear admiral. \u201cResilience is one of the core strands that comes out of our work: the resilience of your military, the resilience of your industrial base, but fundamentally the resilience of your society.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is still early to draw firm conclusions. The urban grind of Bakhmut differs from armoured thrusts. Tactics that work one month fail the next, as people adapt. And a war on the European steppe between two Soviet-legacy armies differs from a future air and sea war in the Pacific. But some principles are emerging. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "First, the modern battlefield can be an unsparing place. Modern sensors can see things with unprecedented fidelity. Modern munitions can hit them with unprecedented precision. Artificial intelligence, whether on board a drone or in a corps hq, fuelled by torrents of data, can identify and prioritise targets with unprecedented speed and subtlety. But Western armies are not optimised to master these technologies. America\u2019s years-long procurement cycle is \u201cfine for tanks or helicopters\u201d, says T.J. Holland of America\u2019s XVIII Corps, but \u201ctoo slow to keep up with the pace of cyber\u201d."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Need to keep moving"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Second, armies that want to survive must disperse, hide and keep on the move. Camouflage and deception are back in vogue. Headquarters must shrink in size, frequently change location and mask their radio emissions. \u201cI haven\u2019t met a soldier who hasn\u2019t learned something from our Ukrainian partners,\u201d says Major-General Chris Barry, director of the British Army\u2019s land-warfare centre. \u201cThe way they dig their positions\u2026it drives [our] standards up.\u201d One official notes that Ukrainian troops, having learned the hard way to minimise electronic signatures, do not switch their mobile phones on even in the English countryside."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fitness still matters. The need for \u201cconstant movement\u201d will be brutal on troops, observes General James Rainey of the us Army\u2019s Futures Command: \u201cWhat are the effects on the humans operating at that kind of tempo?\u201d An attack that would once have required a three-to-one numerical advantage over the defender might now require nine-to-one, he says, for soldiers will not have time to rest. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Third, technology is pushing firepower and intelligence further down the chain of command. A platoon with access to Ukraine\u2019s Delta app, loitering munitions and Starlink terminals can see and strike targets that would once have been the preserve of higher echelons. \u201cThis journey of combining arms is getting lower and lower,\u201d says General Barry, pointing to Russia\u2019s failure to seize an airfield north of Kyiv on the war\u2019s first day. \u201cThe defining act at Hostomel, the destruction of the first aircraft that really unpicked the Russian assault, was probably done by an individual with a phone, a Stinger [missile] and a drone.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This has many implications. It will complicate logistics: how do you push food, ammo and medical care to a larger number of smaller units that are increasingly spread out? It will change recruitment and training: soldiers need more initiative, technical knowledge and skill. It is also an opportunity. Armies once had to concentrate forces in one place to achieve mass. Now they can deliver the same effect in a decentralised way. The us Marine Corps, which is pushing precision weapons down to squads of 13 people, is reorganising itself on these principles. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is a fourth lesson, too. Technology can make war more efficient. But if both sides have the technology, even a highly efficient war is likely to involve enormous costs in blood, metal and treasure. Armies without the size and depth to absorb losses and remain viable on the battlefield may find that no amount of digital wizardry or tactical nous can save them.\u25a0"}], "id": 56}
