Most of them are Masalit, a black African tribe which has long predominated in the west of Sudan\u2019s enormous Darfur region. Satellite imagery suggests that a vast area of the city has been destroyed or damaged by fire, with between 1,100 and 5,000 civilians perishing. So far this is probably the highest death toll of the war in one area, including Khartoum, the capital, which is still the conflict\u2019s core. Refugees from el-Geneina tell of armed Arab militiamen going from door to door, shooting young men dead on the spot. On the road west to Chad (see map), gun-toting militiamen at makeshift checkpoints have robbed and shot civilians fleeing from the mayhem.

The main one is still focused on Khartoum, where two armed factions vie for control of the whole country. The regular army under Sudan\u2019s de facto president, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is fighting against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti. This main conflict, which began in mid-April, has already uprooted millions and laid waste much of the capital. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The war in Darfur, by contrast, has raged and sputtered for 20 years. It began in 2003 with an armed rebellion by neglected and aggrieved African tribes, such as the Masalit, against the Arab-dominated government of Omar al-Bashir, then Sudan\u2019s dictator. In response he armed nomadic Arab cattle-herders as his proxies, unleashing them on the black African farmers with such ferocity that in 2010 he was indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on charges of genocide. In the first five years of the conflict, some 300,000 people may have died, with as many as 2.7m driven from their homes.

With Mr Bashir\u2019s blessing, he eventually turned the Janjaweed into the RSF, which became a multinational business empire with links to the United Arab Emirates and Russia\u2019s Wagner Group.

It may also have been the world\u2019s first climate-change war. Resource-rich but drought-prone, the region\u2019s land had long been contested, as desertification spread and rainfall dwindled. But it took the Arab-supremacist policies of Mr Bashir and his Islamist allies to make Darfur explode. Hopes for a durable peace rose there in 2019 when Mr Bashir\u2019s regime fell and a democratic transition seemed to beckon. A peace deal in 2020 brought Darfuri rebel leaders into a power-sharing government in Khartoum, promising fairer access to resources and the return of land to those who had been driven away. By 2021 a hybrid force of UN and African Union peacekeepers, deployed in 2007, had pulled out.

Many of Darfur\u2019s Arab tribes, as well as their black compatriots, still felt excluded. Violence by Arabs against returning Africans, including the Masalit, soon spread again. Almost as soon as the peacekeepers left, fighting resumed, forcing more than 400,000 people from their homes.

Aid-workers fear the carnage may already be on a par with the early 2000s. \u201cThis is the worst war I\u2019ve seen in 20 years as an aid-worker,\u201d says Justine Muzik of Solidarit\u00e9s International, a France-based humanitarian charity, who was in el-Geneina in late June.

Access through Chad would be vital, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The army\u2019s contingents in Darfur are outgunned and outnumbered so cannot defend the Darfuris from the predations of the RSF or its allied militias, as they are tied up battling for Khartoum.

In some places truces have been arranged by activists and religious leaders. In el-Geneina an edgy calm prevails.
