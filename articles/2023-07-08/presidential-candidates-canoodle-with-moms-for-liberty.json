Since Glenn Youngkin campaigned against CRT and covid-19 school closures in his bid for Virginia\u2019s governorship in 2021, debates over schooling have ignited conservatives. Savvy networking and organising made Moms for Liberty the new face of the cause: that one of the group\u2019s founders is married to the chairman of Florida\u2019s Republican Party no doubt helped woo Mr DeSantis, who is among the Moms\u2019 heftiest backers.
