Thanks to its proximity to the River Irwell, the site became a hub for the booming cotton and timber trades during the Industrial Revolution. After the second world war, as the city\u2019s economy turned towards services, Britain\u2019s first purpose-built television studios were set up there. (Most of the studios were closed or relocated in 2013.) Now the area is undergoing yet another transformation. On June 30th a multi-use arts venue on the banks of the river\u2014costing \u00a3211m ($268m) and spanning more than 140,000 square feet\u2014welcomed its first visitors.

It is mostly funded by the government and Manchester City Council and is the biggest investment in a cultural project in Britain since Tate Modern in 2000. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Osborne saw Factory International as part of his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d policy, which aimed to boost the economies of places such as Manchester and Newcastle, and to shift jobs, investment and influence away from the south-east of England. According to recent data from the Office for National Statistics, London\u2019s gross value added (gva, a measure of output) is around 10% higher than the total of 11 other \u201ccore\u201d cities, including Manchester. Mr Osborne has since left politics\u2014he is now chairman of the British Museum\u2014but talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d continues.

It will be the permanent home of the Manchester International Festival, a biennial event founded in 2007. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The venue can host enormous installations. The inaugural exhibition, \u201cYou, Me and the Balloons\u201d, is the largest-ever show by Yayoi Kusama, a blockbuster Japanese artist (see picture).

The Factory Academy, established in 2018, provides people with the technical skills needed by the venue and by the arts sector at large. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve built a really exciting international arts venue that people across the world will travel to see,\u201d says Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester City Council, but \u201cthat\u2019s only half the story...It\u2019s purposeful growth, not just any old growth.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Manchester is not alone in betting on culture as a catalyst of regeneration. In America, Jersey City hopes to become a \u201cdestination for the arts\u201d and is footing the bill for Centre Pompidou\u2019s first North American outpost, due to open in 2026. In 2021 Abu Dhabi confirmed it would spend $6bn on its creative industries over five years in an attempt to diversify from oil; Muhammad bin Salman hopes to turn Al Ula into Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital of culture.

Yet evidence suggests that a vibrant culture scene brings several benefits. Research by Centre for Cities, a think-tank, found that proximity to recreation facilities is important to 25- to 34-year-olds and influences their decisions about where to live. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Culture has an impact on well-being, too. Researchers at University College London analysed a series of longitudinal studies conducted between 2017 and 2022 in America and Britain.

Whether you are reading a book or going to the opera, you are guarding against depression, dementia and chronic pain. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the 19th century, as Americans and Europeans moved to the city, governments built public institutions to enrich people\u2019s lives. Some economists have long sensed that this kind of investment can pay dividends. In Britain the Arts Council was established in the wake of the second world war to distribute government money across England, Scotland and Wales. John Maynard Keynes, a lover of opera and ballet, was its first chairman. \u201cAt last the public exchequer has recognised the support and encouragement of the civilising arts of life as a part of their duty,\u201d he said.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The economic value of such institutions was further underscored by the success of Guggenheim Bilbao, also inaugurated in 1997. The Spanish city was undergoing structural change, says Juan Ignacio Vidarte, the museum\u2019s director. Steel and shipbuilding, historically a large part of the city\u2019s economy, was in decline; unemployment was high. The local government paid the $100m cost of the building, designed by Frank Gehry. That decision attracted opprobrium, but authorities recognised that the venue \u201cwas important for defining the future prospects of the city\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The risk paid off. Last year the museum attracted 1.3m visitors, two-thirds coming from outside Spain; Mr Vidarte says that visitors\u2019 spending in Bilbao raised more than \u20ac70m ($76m) in taxes for the regional government. The regeneration of the city, spearheaded by the Guggenheim, has been dubbed the \u201cBilbao effect\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The wrong conclusions are sometimes drawn from the project, Mr Vidarte warns. The museum did not reverse the city\u2019s fortunes single-handedly: just as important was the investment in transport infrastructure and the cleaning up of the Nervi\u00f3n river (on which the museum sits.) It is not enough to commission an architect to design \u201ca flamboyant building and think that\u2019s going to be the magic wand to turn everything from dust to diamonds,\u201d Mr Vidarte says. \u201cThat\u2019s so naive.\u201d "}, {"role": "second", "text": "All that glitters"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A multitude of factors make a city appealing to tourists as well as migrants. Economist Intelligence Unit, a sister company of The Economist, calculates a city\u2019s \u201cliveability\u201d according to five broad categories: culture and environment, education and infrastructure, health care and stability. Abu Dhabi welcomed an outpost of the Louvre in 2017; in recent years, its score has risen thanks to improvements in public services.
