In this group of eight countries\u2014Brazil, Chile, Hungary, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland and South Korea\u2014central banks have fought inflation with unparalleled aggression. Hikelandia started raising interest rates a whole year before America\u2019s Federal Reserve, putting it well ahead of the curve. Since then its average policy rate has risen by more than seven percentage points, compared with around five for the Fed. Yet for months Hikelandia\u2019s central bankers had little joy: inflation kept rising."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now, at long last, that is changing. Although Hikelandia\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d inflation, a measure that strips out volatile prices such as for food and energy, is still too high, at around 9% year on year, it is on the way down, in part because higher rates are starting to bite (see chart). Hikelandia\u2019s experience offers a glimmer of hope for other inflation-fighting central banks."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230708_FNC753.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Wage inflation is moderating across the land. In Chile, for example, pay growth is down a little from the outrageously high 11% year-on-year rate reached in January. This, in turn, is helping cut measures of inflationary pressure. In October South Korea\u2019s inflation rate in the labour-intensive service sector was 4.2% year on year; it has since fallen to 3.3%. Poland\u2019s has slipped from 13.4% in December to 12.3%."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Inflation expectations are also dropping, influenced by falling energy and food prices. The average Brazilian expects inflation of 4% over the next year, down from 6% for much of 2022. Kiwis reckon inflation in five years\u2019 time will be around 1%, half their forecast in December."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Norway is the only member of Hikelandia that seems to be making no progress. In May core prices unexpectedly rose by 6.7% year on year, a new high. A weaker krone is raising the cost of imports. Strong domestic demand is playing a role, too. In June the central bank surprised markets in an attempt to cool things down, raising the policy rate by 0.5 percentage points."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Outside Oslo, the mood music in Hikelandia\u2019s central banks has changed. Officials are still talking tough, of course. South Korea\u2019s rate-setters insist that they will maintain hawkish policy for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d. Brazil\u2019s monetary-policy committee worries about \u201ca larger or more persistent de-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations\u201d. Yet this hides the fact that Hikelandia\u2019s central banks have largely stopped raising rates. Chile\u2019s bank believes inflationary risks \u201chave been balancing out\u201d. Hungary\u2019s rate-setters expect that \u201cdisinflation will continue to accelerate\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Success has come at a cost, though. In 2021 the world economy and Hikelandia grew at the same speed. Now, global growth is 2.5% at an annualised rate, and Hikelandia is stagnating. The unemployment rate has risen by close to a percentage point from a recent low in Chile, and is inching up in Brazil and New Zealand. At least for a while, Hikelandia\u2019s policymakers will probably see a slower economy as a price worth paying. Inflation will have to fall an awfully long way before we start calling these countries \u201cCutlandia\u201d. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 65}
