By Julian Jackson. Harvard University Press; 480 pages; $35. Allen Lane; \u00a320"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Few home-grown 20th-century leaders prompt as much discomfort for the French as Philippe P\u00e9tain. The head of the Vichy regime, who signed the armistice with Germany on June 22nd 1940 and was photographed shaking the hand of Adolf Hitler in the French town of Montoire, embodied his country\u2019s collaboration with Nazi Germany and the sacrifice of its national honour. In this painstakingly researched work, Julian Jackson, a British historian and biographer of Charles de Gaulle, examines P\u00e9tain\u2019s trial as a way to put both a leader and a country in the dock."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The court case took place over three weeks, between victory over the Third Reich on May 8th 1945 and the Nuremberg trials that began in November that year. Mr Jackson vividly reconstructs the drama. It was the height of summer. Rationing was still in place. But cinemas in Paris were open, as was the Louvre, where the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d had returned after being hidden for four years in different secret locations around France. A special high court was set up, and a jury of 24 selected for the trial: all men, half of them members of the Resistance, half pre-war parliamentarians. The prosecution made use of 60 crates of archives from Vichy, and a veritable \u201cHimalaya of official papers\u201d, wrote one investigator, \u201cwhich soon made our corridors and offices look like wartime trenches\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the courtroom P\u00e9tain spoke little and remained inscrutable, \u201chis tired eyes continuously blinking\u201d, as one journalist noted. Indeed the original assumption was that the marshal would be tried in absentia. In 1944 the Nazis had transferred him to the turreted castle of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, in Germany, where Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line, a pro-Vichy French novelist, also found refuge. To general astonishment, the 89-year-old P\u00e9tain handed himself in, in order to return to Paris and answer to the French people. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "When the old man in a khaki field uniform entered the courtroom, it fell silent. P\u00e9tain\u2019s opening statement, writes Mr Jackson, was \u201ca compilation of dubious assertions and half-truths, approximations and provocations\u201d. He had signed the armistice as an \u201cact of salvation\u201d, he insisted. It had spared France \u201cthe fate of Poland\u201d, argued his defence lawyers. The marshal, they claimed, was not Pierre Laval, the Vichy prime minister, who actually sympathised with Nazi Germany; P\u00e9tain had \u201cprotected\u201d many Jews. Moreover, \u201cIf he was guilty so was all of France.\u201d Parliament, after all, had voted in 1940 to hand over powers to the marshal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The spectacle was miserable. L\u00e9on Blum, France\u2019s pre-war Socialist prime minister, who had been deported to Nazi Germany in 1943, told the court that French leaders \u201chad been dipped into some kind of toxic bath\u2026the nobility and courage of men that one had known corroded and dissolved in front of one\u2019s eyes\u201d. The trial\u2019s conclusion, at a time of intense post-war purges, was never in any doubt. Andr\u00e9 Mornet, the chief public prosecutor, took five hours to deliver the r\u00e9quisitoire. P\u00e9tain was sentenced to death, a decision that de Gaulle later commuted to life imprisonment. He was stripped of his military honours. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "After meeting Hitler, P\u00e9tain had declared: \u201cIt is I alone who will be judged by history.\u201d In 1945 the Paris court certainly judged him severely. But it was not until 1995 that a French president, Jacques Chirac, acknowledged his country\u2019s responsibility for terrible acts carried out under occupation, referring specifically to the round-up of thousands of Jews at the Vel\u2019 d\u2019Hiv\u2019 stadium in Paris in 1942 before they were sent to their deaths. This \u201cundermined the Gaullist narrative that between 1940 and 1944 \u2018France\u2019 had been in London [where de Gaulle had fled] and that Vichy was a parenthesis in French history\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The legal basis for this argument remains contested, as Mr Jackson points out. But only the nationalist right today tries to defend P\u00e9tain. Successive presidents have, rather, reaffirmed the French state\u2019s responsibility. When speaking in 2017 of the Vel\u2019 d\u2019Hiv\u2019 round-up, Emmanuel Macron, the current president, stated soberly: \u201cNot a single German took part.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indeed, the complexity of the figure of P\u00e9tain is now difficult to evoke for any moderate democratic politician. During the first world war, as Mr Jackson notes, the marshal was a distinguished military tactician, who earned national admiration for commanding the French troops in Verdun. P\u00e9tain and de Gaulle were close for several years, and in 1926 visited the Verdun battlefields together. In 2018, ahead of centenary commemorations for the end of the first world war, Mr Macron suggested that it might be \u201clegitimate\u201d to pay homage to P\u00e9tain in this specific historical context. The idea prompted an outcry and was quietly dropped. The wound that P\u00e9tain left in France remains raw. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 76}
