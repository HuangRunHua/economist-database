When Kyiv was under threat, civilians mixed Molotov cocktails to hurl at invading armoured vehicles. Volunteers have raised money for vehicles and drones.

Colonel Oleh Shevchuk, commander of Ukraine\u2019s 43rd artillery brigade, and Serhiy Ogerenko, his chief of staff, speaking to Ukrainska Pravda, a newspaper, say civilians helped correct artillery fire, even using their own commercial drones.

But if civilians are building drones, hauling military gear over the border from Poland, reporting on troop movements through apps and correcting artillery fire over video chat, do they become legitimate military targets?

But what this means is hotly disputed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The ICRC says direct participation must involve actions that deliberately affect military operations in favour of one side. That is a high bar. Experts agree that civilians who just answer questions do not meet the threshold. Colonel Shevchuk\u2019s phone calls would not automatically implicate those who pick up. Moreover, most intelligence passed on by apps is \u201ctoo general or insignificant to meet the threshold of harm criterion,\u201d argues Mr Macak. A civilian would have to gather and transmit information \u201cas part of a co-ordinated operation for the purposes of a specific attack\u201d. But flying a drone to correct shellfire would surely qualify. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One lesson is that connectivity is increasingly a vital military resource. The Taliban long ago tore down mobile-phone towers to stop Afghan villagers sending tip-offs to security forces. Mexican drug cartels now use signal-jamming equipment.

If Ukrainian civilians have so often been willing to jeopardise their status as non-combatants, it may be because Russia\u2019s army has shown scant regard for such niceties. General Nikolyuk recalls Russian troops establishing a headquarters in a school in Yahidne, a village south of Chernihiv. Hundreds of locals were imprisoned in the basement. On another occasion in nearby Lukashivka, he says Russian soldiers, spotting a Ukrainian drone, forced women and children to walk down the street as human shields. \u201cWhat do you do in such cases?
