That all speaks to a weakness in Chinese foreign policy that could undermine Mr Xi\u2019s ambitions. Put simply, can China really challenge American leadership in the world if it cannot get its own neighbours on board?

Reservations about China stem instead from its own missteps, according to officials and academics in neighbouring countries. In particular, they cite excessive muscularity on territorial issues, haphazard or coercive economic policies and a heavy-handed approach to diplomacy that is rooted in China\u2019s imperial past and grand assumptions about its future.

Between 1991 and 2002 it resolved disagreements about its land borders with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Tajikistan and Vietnam.

Its ships and aircraft now regularly patrol around rocky specks where its claims overlap with Japan\u2019s in the East China Sea. The seven fortified artificial islands that it built on disputed reefs in the South China Sea have enhanced its capacity to enforce its claims there. In some contested border areas, Indian troops no longer patrol."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those gains have come at a cost, however, by alarming China\u2019s neighbours.
