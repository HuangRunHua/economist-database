I take a more positive view. The purpose of export controls is to raise costs to competitors by impeding access to better technologies. Those who impose and implement such controls are well aware that countries subject to them try to circumvent them through smuggling, buying substitutes from alternative suppliers, or developing replacement products. These activities are costly. Smuggling is a poor substitute for having an established arrangement with a supplier. For products that need a steady source of chips, it is impossible to guarantee a secure supply if one relies on smuggling. The current embargo on microchips to Russia has had a notable impact on Russian arms production even as the Russian government has sought to purchase chips illegally."}, {"role": "body", "text": "During the cold war, export controls caused the Soviet Union to invest heavily in inferior electronics, diverting resources that could have gone to other uses. In the case of China, developing alternative chip-manufacturing equipment or cutting-edge microchips will be difficult, especially when Chinese companies and universities are hindered from participating in the free flow of ideas and technologies. China has many capable people, but when confined to collaborating solely with Chinese colleagues, they do not fully share in the developments taking place elsewhere. Moreover, China had pursued policies to develop its own technologies in these areas long before the embargoes. Being cut off from collaboration with Western companies is unlikely to make its efforts more successful. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The article notes that Nvidia will lose sales because of the controls. Many of the sales of Nvidia chips to China go into products that are then exported by China back to the rest of the world. One of the reasons the controls were imposed was to diversify suppliers of these products to Western markets. Many of Nvidia\u2019s chip sales will not disappear; they will go to countries that will pick up the assembly operations that used to take place in China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In short, The Economist is wrong to say that controls are ineffective and counter- productive. They are leaky and do not preclude China from developing alternatives, but they impose costs that are much higher for China than for America and its allies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dr Keith CraneSenior economistRANDArlington, Virginia"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240203_LDD003.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "second", "text": "School choice"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Your leader on charter schools overlooked a big factor influencing the educational effectiveness of public schools in America (\u201cA charter for change\u201d, February 3rd). The overwhelming majority of American children are assigned to one local neighbourhood school based on their address, without a single tuition-free alternative. Although some K-12 students may be able to choose a \u201cmagnet\u201d school instead, it will still be managed (and often mismanaged) by the same school district that operates their local school and all of the publicly funded schools in that geographic area.

So what if a dwelling of a particular value attracts significantly less council tax in one council than another? So what if one council\u2019s property prices have risen four times faster than another council\u2019s?
