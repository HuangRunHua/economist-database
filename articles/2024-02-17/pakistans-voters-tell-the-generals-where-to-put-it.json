But the vote nonetheless produced a clear winner: Imran Khan, the imprisoned former prime minister who was barred from standing and whose party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was subject to a de facto ban. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Voters disregarded the hints to shun Mr Khan (pictured), casting their ballots for his candidates anyway. Members of the PTI, standing as independents, bagged 92 of the 264 parliamentary seats being voted on (70 reserved seats will be allocated proportionally). The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) of Nawaz Sharif, Mr Khan\u2019s chief rival and a three-time former prime minister, was widely expected to win. It limped in second with 75 seats."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the PTI will not form the government. Instead, Shehbaz Sharif, Mr Sharif\u2019s younger brother and the president of the PML-N, is likely to become prime minister. On February 13th his party agreed to a coalition with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, which won 54 seats. Asif Ali Zardari, Mr Bhutto\u2019s father, will be the nominee for president. The younger Mr Sharif appears to be backed in his efforts by the army chief, who praised the \u201cfree and unhindered\u201d election and called for \u201cstable hands\u201d to put an end to \u201canarchy and polarisation\u201d in the country. PML-N has also approached Mr Khan\u2019s winning candidates to switch sides. At least one has already jumped."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Khan\u2019s party claims to have evidence that it would have won a majority of seats if the election had not been rigged. It has already begun to challenge the results in court. Mr Sharif\u2019s party denies the allegations. \u201cHow can they claim rigging when they are the single largest party in the National Assembly?\u201d says Khawaja Asif, a PML-N leader in Sialkot. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet signs of tampering are plentiful. The election commission, which had been instrumental in obstructing Mr Khan and the PTI in the run-up to the election, blamed days of delay in releasing results on unspecified \u201cinternet issues\u201d. It initially barred returning officers from certifying results and ordered a repeat of the vote in dozens of polling stations after reports of snatched and destroyed ballot papers. But it soon reversed course and confirmed results in disputed constituencies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The dubious electoral process was preceded by a systematic campaign, orchestrated by the army, against Mr Khan and the PTI. The election commission stripped the party of its electoral symbol, a cricket bat, in effect dissolving it. The Supreme Court sealed the deal by overturning a successful challenge to this in a lower court. Many PTI leaders were imprisoned or disqualified. Those who stood as independents were prevented from campaigning openly. A week before the election Mr Khan, already in jail on a separate charge, was sentenced to three long prison terms in quick succession on counts of corruption, disclosing state secrets and getting married illegally. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That the PTI succeeded despite all this is a rebuke to Pakistan\u2019s army, which for the past few months has ruled the country from behind the scenes through a loyal caretaker government and tried its best to force Mr Khan and the PTI into political irrelevance. The result may, some hope, prove a turning point in the generals\u2019 ability to influence Pakistan\u2019s politics. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the immediate consequence for Pakistani voters will be more of the same. Though blatant rigging in some instances could be reversed by legal challenges, the PTI will be confined to the opposition benches. The Sharif-Bhutto coalition set to take power is very similar to the one that took over after Mr Khan was forced from office in April 2022 and ruled until parliament was dissolved last August. The only difference is that it will enjoy even less legitimacy this time around. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That bodes ill for Pakistan, which faces an economic crisis, an escalating threat from terrorism and an increasingly hostile neighbourhood. Pakistani voters have made it clear that they are tired of the old way of doing things. Their leaders, predictably, have once more dashed their hopes for something new.\u25a0"}], "id": 18}
