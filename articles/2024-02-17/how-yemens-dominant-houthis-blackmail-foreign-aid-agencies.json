After a decade of war, the UN reckons that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is one of the world\u2019s worst. Over half of its 33m people need aid to survive, many of them under Houthi control in the north-west. But across their realm the Houthis hinder aid flows. They insist that the UN uses the Houthis\u2019 own list of beneficiaries and lets the Houthis oversee distribution. They have barred access to international aid workers. They tax shipments, sell aid and charge customs fees at checkpoints. In sum, they treat the aid programme worth billions of dollars as a cash cow. \u201cAs in Gaza, the risk of famine is man-made,\u201d says a former UN official. \u201cThey use aid as a weapon.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240217_MAM963.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 658.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the past decade Yemen\u2019s economy has survived mainly through foreign aid.

Instead the Houthis insist that the UN and other aid agencies use a ration list that their own administration has drawn up. This list also serves as a register for taxes and perhaps for the military draft.

In December the World Food Programme (WFP) suspended deliveries to all 9.5m recipients in Houthi areas. It is hard to know the impact of this, since access is so tricky. Trouble in the Red Sea has pushed up insurance premiums on shipping, increasing costs for the cash-strapped WFP, and may slow the supply of basics to Houthi-controlled ports. Alas, the hungrier the population becomes, the more it depends on the Houthis. \u25a0"}], "id": 33}
