Latterly a gate-crasher has stomped in. China has shaken Australian assumptions in the Pacific."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Australia has deep ties with the Pacific islands. It was the colonial administrator in Papua New Guinea (PNG) until independence in 1975. During unrest in the Solomon Islands between 2003 and 2017, it provided a policing mission. It has helped plug the budget holes of island states. They are \u201cfamily\u201d, as an Aussie prime minister once put it\u2014a word tinged with paternalism. On February 8th family was celebrated in Canberra with the first-ever address to Parliament by a Pacific leader, PNG\u2019s James Marape."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China is one reason behind the red carpet laid out for Mr Marape. PNG, immediately to Australia\u2019s north, is vital to its security. But China is wooing Mr Marape with infrastructure and investment. It can point to the gleaming Chinese-built or -refurbished stadiums and police headquarters that adorn towns in Fiji, the Solomon Islands and the Cook Islands. Such overtures have helped Chinese state firms gain a hold in the Pacific. China buys or extracts about half of the region\u2019s minerals, timber and seafood. Now another bonanza beckons, for seabed minerals."}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s political gains are also striking. Since 2019 the Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Nauru have switched diplomatic allegiance from democratic Taiwan to China, helped by financial inducements to ruling politicians. Most controversially, in 2022 the Solomon Islands\u2019 Australia-resenting prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, signed a security pact with China. Chinese police sit in the capital, Honiara. A potential military base in the Solomon Islands would represent a big threat to Australia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Concerns in Canberra are thus understandable. China is securing resources, buying political influence and seeking military access. It hopes for regional hegemony. That would mean imposing its will on vulnerable island states, as well as destabilising the regional order; though China promises infrastructure, investment and access to a huge market, its approach can corrupt local politics. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Australia\u2019s response can be heavy-handed, notably over demands that island states upgrade their security relationships with it. A case in point is tiny Tuvalu. Late last year the two countries signed a ground-breaking treaty whereby Australia promised to help the atoll nation tackle climate change while offering rights to Tuvalu\u2019s citizens to settle in Australia. The treaty also included a security agreement to stop Tuvalu falling under China\u2019s sway. But the government that negotiated the treaty has since fallen, and opposition to the security deal is building."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In truth, Pacific countries do not prioritise hard security. Mark Brown, prime minister of the Cook Islands, says \u201cdevelopment is the Pacific\u2019s number-one security priority,\u201d especially in the face of a warming planet. Even Mr Marape, a staunch friend of Australia\u2019s, was reluctant in January to invoke PNG\u2019s security treaty with Australia following deadly riots in the capital, Port Moresby, for fear of looking like Australia\u2019s lapdog."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Marape faces a vote of no confidence this month, with the riots a factor in the political turmoil. In the Solomon Islands a general election, always a turbulent time, is due in April. Meanwhile, Tuvalu remains without a government. Some Australians wring their hands: China, with its back-room blandishments, navigates such crises with ease."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Australia cannot begin to match China\u2019s commercial clout. Still, its concerns are overblown; its Pacific strengths remain substantial. Whereas China\u2019s aid to the Pacific has fallen since the pandemic, Australia\u2019s still grows, accounting for two-fifths of all assistance, well ahead of the Asian Development Bank in second place and China in third. It offers education opportunities and technical assistance. A new infrastructure-financing facility competes with the corruption-heavy Chinese approach. It is boosting opportunities for work and immigration\u2014hugely popular among Pacific islanders. And its \u201cnumber-one weapon\u201d, as Mihai Sora of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, puts it, is sports diplomacy, with offers to bring Pacific rugby teams into Australian leagues. China wields no such soft power. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The lesson is clear. To counter China across the Pacific, Australia should broaden its horizons from security to match those of the island states themselves. There is no better way to trump the cynical Chinese approach. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia: Singapore cracks down on Chinese influence (Feb 8th)Asia\u2019s commercial heft helps keep Russia\u2019s war economy going (Feb 1st)South Korea\u2019s ban on praising the North is ridiculous (Jan 22nd)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Banyan column got its name"}], "id": 20}
