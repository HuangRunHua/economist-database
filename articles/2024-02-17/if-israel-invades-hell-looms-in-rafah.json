On February 14th Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, said he would not send a team to negotiate a truce in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages by Hamas, citing the group\u2019s \u201cdelusional demands\u201d. Simultaneously fears have been rising for days of a massive Israeli army invasion of Rafah, Gaza\u2019s southernmost city that is hemmed along the border with Egypt, where 1m or more Palestinians are located. Any expansion of the fighting will probably have devastating consequences for civilians, detonate Israel\u2019s relationship with Egypt and exhaust American patience. Yet Mr Netanyahu is intent on escalating, insisting that it may be necessary in order to achieve \u201ctotal victory\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Netanyahu\u2019s emphasis on Rafah is in part an attempt to boost his standing by promising Israelis a decisive result in the war. On February 12th the embattled prime minister was given a fillip when commandos rescued two hostages from the Al-Shabura neighbourhood in Rafah (diversionary bombardments killed 74 Palestinians). \u201cOnly continued military pressure\u2026will bring about the relief of all our hostages,\u201d he said afterwards. Yet the focus on Rafah is not just about Mr Netanyahu\u2019s self-preservation. Within the Israeli security establishment there is an acknowledgment of the benefits of taking on Hamas there, in its last major stronghold, and of gaining control of the border with Egypt, the main channel for arms-smuggling."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the assessment of security officials, Hamas is on the back foot. The movement\u2019s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is the subject of a manhunt in Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The group has been trying to re-establish its presence in Gaza city, in the north, by putting police on the streets and paying civil servants. Yet Israeli intelligence officials believe Hamas leaders worry they are losing control over the population. More than 10,000 Hamas members are believed to have been killed and thousands more wounded or captured. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) says around 18 of Hamas\u2019s 24 battalions have been \u201cdismantled\u201d.

One is whether Mr Netanyahu can rally domestic momentum for a new front in the war. This is by no means assured. The operation he is touting would be large and include entire brigades that would probably remain there for weeks. The IDF has yet to start mustering troops for a manoeuvre of this scale. Instead the generals have been pulling troops out of Gaza and demobilising many of the 300,000 reservists called up on October 7th. Meanwhile the economic costs of the conflict are mounting. On February 9th Moody\u2019s, a credit-rating agency, downgraded Israel from A1 to A2. It warned that a prolonged war could \u201cweaken executive and legislative institutions\u201d.

If elections were held now, Mr Gantz\u2019s centrist National Unity party would get more than twice the votes of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud. Although Mr Netanyahu\u2019s predicament gives him an incentive to gamble on redemption by escalating in Rafah, the generals and the pragmatic wing of the war cabinet, led by Mr Gantz, prefer to pursue a deal to free more hostages. For them, Rafah can come later."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whether such a deal might happen depends on the talks in Cairo resuming, and on Hamas. Israel has flatly rejected its demands for a full ceasefire and the permanent withdrawal of Israeli troops in Gaza before any exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Despite Israel withdrawing its negotiators from the talks, the Israeli assessment remains that Hamas\u2019s demand is just an opening gambit and that a deal can be reached on a temporary truce. Israeli officials believe that Hamas\u2019s need to regroup and provide the population with some desperately needed respite before the holy fasting month of Ramadan, which is expected to start on March 10th, could force it to show more flexibility on hostage negotiations. To avoid hell in Rafah, one side needs to blink first. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Correction (February 14th): An earlier version of this article had the incorrect date for Mr Biden\u2019s comments."}], "id": 31}
