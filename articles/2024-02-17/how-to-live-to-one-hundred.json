Although some of its citizens enjoy very long lives, Britain excels at producing much shorter ones, too. Britain\u2019s middling life-expectancy figures disguise extremes. Centenarians tend to cluster more on the south coast, in areas like Bournemouth and Bognor Regis as well as in East Devon. But in many other coastal towns, such as Blackpool, life expectancy is much lower than the national average. London is also not a place for the very old: of the eight local authorities in England and Wales with fewer than ten centenarians per 100,000 population, six are in the capital."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rather than blue zones, where a specific environment is associated with greater longevity, it seems more likely that Britain has silver zones, places which attract longer-lived people in middle age or upon retirement.

Her biggest health complaint relates to a prescription toothpaste sent to the wrong pharmacy (at 105 she still had 26 of her own teeth; now she is down to 21).
