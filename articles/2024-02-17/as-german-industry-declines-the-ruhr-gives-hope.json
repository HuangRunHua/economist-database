Last year its economy shrank by 0.3%, the worst result in the G7 group of rich countries. Deutsche Bank, the country\u2019s biggest, reckons industrial output has sunk by 9% since 2018 and will fall another 2.5% this year. The talk in boardrooms is of creeping de-industrialisation as high domestic costs\u2014especially for energy\u2014push firms to relocate."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For a vision of the future look to Germany\u2019s former industrial heartland, the Ruhrgebiet, or more simply the Ruhr. Once home to Europe\u2019s biggest coal mine, its biggest steel mill and munitions plants that supplied two world wars, the English-county-sized region has been hollowed out. Two-thirds of its workers toiled in industry in the 1960s. Under one in five now do, as in the rest of Germany. On maps that show where factories cluster in Europe, the region pales against booming locales such as western Romania and southern Poland."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240217_EUM993.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 625.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Focus more closely, however, and this vision of Germany\u2019s future looks a lot less dim. American rust-belt cities such as Pittsburgh shrank by half or more after the 1960s; the Ruhr\u2019s population fell by barely 10%. Its workforce has actually grown. With 5.1m people in a cluster of some 50 towns, it contains Germany\u2019s biggest conurbation. The Ruhr has long since scrubbed its air and rivers, tidied slag heaps into forested hills and converted hulking factories into quirky museums. Huge investments in higher education (the region hosts 260,000 university students) have made it a centre for R&amp;D. A prime location and dense transport infrastructure have lured logistics firms, now the region\u2019s top private employer. The Ruhr is, in short, a much nicer place to live than the chimney-studded powerhouse of old."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are outliers, of course. The region\u2019s southern half, with the big cities of Dortmund, Duisburg and Essen, has prospered while the more coal-dependent north has stalled. \u201cThere is huge segregation,\u201d says Thomas Bauer of RWI-Essen, an economic research institute. \u201cEverything north of the A40 autobahn is still problematic.\u201d The mid-sized town of Gelsenkirchen, for instance, has suffered chronic unemployment since the last mines shut in 2018. The jobless rate in 2023 was 14.6%, nearly three times the rest of Germany\u2019s. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mostly, though, the Ruhr has rebounded strongly. In its biggest city, Dortmund, the jobless rate touched 20% in 2005 after the closure of the Hoesch steelworks that once employed one in five of the town\u2019s workers. More people now work on its abandoned factory sites than before they closed. A mill for specialised steels occupies just a corner of one vast suburban site, dwarfed by a giant logistics park next door, which is linked to rail, canal and road junctions. Another site has become a sparkling campus for corporate offices, with a derelict turbine hall converted into a venue for high-tech light spectacles. Once a slurry pit, a huge artificial lake is now ringed with fancy apartments and offices. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Arturo de la Vega of the city\u2019s planning department is ebullient. \u201dOur plan is for growth,\u201d he enthuses. With its population projected to reach 625,000 in 2035 (up from 601,000 now), Dortmund is building new schools and a children\u2019s museum. Having learned from the Hoesch collapse, it has focused not on winning big-name firms but on diversifying its economy and nurturing innovation. \u201cMost companies here are less than 20 years old, and most you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d says Mr de la Vega. This \u201ccentipede strategy\u201d has paid off. Not only has the local economy weathered recent shocks, the city\u2019s coffers are full. Its latest project is a new startup campus to revive a canalside district."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The funding is key, because sustaining the Ruhr has required lots of public money over a long period of time. Perhaps too much, thinks Christoph Schmidt, the president of RWI-Essen. A bit more \u201ccreative destruction\u201d might have made the Ruhr adapt faster, he suggests. Some interventions have flopped. Gelsenkirchen\u2019s prospects as a hub for solar power ended when subsidies dried up, and cheaper Chinese panels flooded in.

Christoph Noeres of Thyssenkrupp Nucera, a recent spin-off of the Duisburg-based steel giant that designs electrolysers to produce hydrogen, is optimistic. Typical of today\u2019s Ruhr, his firm no longer makes things; the 500 workers at its Dortmund headquarters design and market complex processes that rely on equally complex supply chains. \u201cOf course some operations may transfer outside of Germany,\u201d he says. \u201cBut here we are used to transformations and innovation.
