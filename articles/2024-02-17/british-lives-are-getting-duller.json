Last month the final surviving member of the original SASdied. A year or so ago the last \u201cDambuster\u201d pilot died. A few years before that, the last Battle of Britain Spitfire ace did. Britain\u2019s finest hour has long since passed; now those who fought in it are passing, too. Those who never surrendered are now surrendering. And as they go, Britain must face the loss not only of a generation and of a direct connection to history but also, somewhat less seriously, of a niche literary genre: the late-20th-century obituary. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The genre emerged in the 1980s. Before then obituaries tended to serve readers a diet of fresh corpses and stale prose\u2014respectable judges, unimpeachable wives and phrases in the \u201cshe passed away peacefully\u201d and \u201ctributes poured in\u201d vein. Then things changed. Led by Hugh Massingberd, an obituaries editor at the Daily Telegraph, the in-house journal of the upper classes from which almost all of the excerpts below are drawn, the British press saw the possibility in chronicling colourful lives in colourful ways. Suddenly obituaries started to offer characters such as \u201cBrigadier \u2018Slasher\u2019 Somerset\u201d and \u201cthe last Wali of Swat\u201d and phrases such as \u201che tried slithering along a sewer\u201d or \u201ccowering in the back of a hayloft in\u2026Lower Silesia\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The history of the 20th century offered ample material. Wars and revolutions may offer death on an unprecedented scale but they also offer life on it, too. No previous century could have offered the undertaker one Lady Paget, who \u201cspent much of her life rescuing English governesses stranded in Soviet Russia\u201d; Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, who was \u201cinjured by a looted grand piano, which had fallen from a passing truck on to his car\u201d; or the redoubtable Major-General Eric Harrison, who, having given \u201cdistinguished service\u201d in both world wars, also found time to be a \u201crepresentative rugby player, an Olympic athlete, a legendary rider to hounds [and] pig-sticker\u201d. Today LinkedIn is lamentably low on pig-stickers. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Empires and changing borders also provided a distinctive canvas. Countries were still being administered, and even created, by mere handfuls of people in much of the 20th century.

It is studded with aristocrats as well as autocrats. There is much to criticise about outmoded, unjust, elitist English aristocrats. Dullness is not high on the list.

To read about them is to be confronted by a species of human that already feels as exotic and outmoded as a Regency rake. In an era in which people now begin to climb the career ladder at school, it is fascinating to encounter the third Lord Moynihan (\u201cbongo-drummer, confidence trickster, brothel-keeper\u201d) for whom the word \u201ccareer\u201d was more verb than noun. In an age that frets over microaggressions, it is sobering to read of those who coped stoically with the macro-kind: phrases such as the \u201cbullet passed through his chest and killed the man behind\u201d pepper these reviews like shot. (Though even this generation had its qualms: when asked to land in a pineapple plantation during the second world war, General Sir Nigel Poett, who had earlier commanded a brigade in the D-Day landings, suggested that \u201ca rubber estate might be less prickly\u201d.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such characters are not entirely extinct; opportunities for adventure still exist. When confronted with the option of derring-do, however, most Britons derring-don\u2019t.

Although the general tone of these obituaries is droll, they are pierced with lines\u2014\u201chis two other sons were killed, one at Monte Cassino\u201d\u2014that hint at the kind of pain no pen can capture.

One cannot be sure of happiness in life but one can at least be entertained.
