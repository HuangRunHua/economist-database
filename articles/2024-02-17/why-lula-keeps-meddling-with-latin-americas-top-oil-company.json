Its shares have outperformed those of ExxonMobil and Chevron in the past year. Months before, it had laid out an investment strategy costing $102bn over the next five years, the largest such plan for nearly a decade. Most of the investment will go to the expansion of offshore basins in the country\u2019s south-east, known as the pre-salts, and the development of new offshore fields in the north-east. The expansion could help Brazil become the world\u2019s fourth-biggest oil producer by the end of the decade, up from seventh today, according to Rystad Energy, a consultancy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet despite the glowing headlines, investors should be vigilant. Under the administration of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (or Lula), who was previously in power from 2003 to 2010, the government is increasingly meddling in Petobras\u2019s decisions, after several years during which state interference had declined. That is leading to poor business choices. It also increases the possibility of corruption."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240217_AMM995.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 967.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Petrobras\u2019s success is all the more striking given its recent history. In 2014, under Lula\u2019s hand-picked successor, Dilma Rousseff, Petrobras was found to be at the centre of a sprawling kickbacks scheme in which it doled out contracts at inflated prices. Contractors paid bribes to certain executives at Petrobras using this extra cash. These executives and contractors also funnelled money to dozens of politicians. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Under pressure from Ms Rousseff, Petrobras lost $40bn between 2011 and 2014 by keeping domestic petrol prices artificially low. Partly in order to pay for this, and partly because interest rates were low, the company took on enormous dollar-denominated debts. When oil prices collapsed in 2014, the corruption scandal erupted and the real depreciated, Petrobras hit a nadir. By 2015 it had debts totalling almost $130bn, making it the world\u2019s most-indebted oil firm. The following year it had lost 90% of its value compared with 2011."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240217_AMC410.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 739.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The company owes much of its turnaround to Pedro Parente, a far-sighted CEO who was appointed under the centrist government of Michel Temer in 2016.

The domestic price of fuel was linked to its cost on international markets. To raise revenue and pay off debts, Mr Parente sold billions of dollars worth of assets in fertilisers, distribution and petrochemicals. The company also focused on the business of drilling for deep-sea oil. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Oil be back, interfering"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To prevent another corruption scandal, Mr Parente set up an independent compliance department and a robust channel for whistleblowers. Crucially, it has become harder for corrupt executives to make individual procurement decisions. Now a team of managers from different departments must sign them off. By 2021, the value of the company was around $70bn and its debts were down to $37bn."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For a while, politics helped. In 2016 Brazil\u2019s Congress passed the \u201cstate-owned companies law\u201d, which made it harder to appoint politicians to state-owned firms. But this gentlemen\u2019s accord began to unravel in 2018, when Mr Parente resigned after lorry-drivers went on strike to demand lower fuel prices. Mr Temer\u2019s populist right-wing successor, Jair Bolsonaro, appointed four CEOs in as many years, including a general with no previous experience in oil. Mr Bolsonaro also appointed three political allies to Petrobras\u2019s 11-member board, even though many people worried they lacked industry experience. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lula has not only continued this political interference, but ramped it up. Like Mr Bolsonaro, he forced two of his picks onto Petrobras\u2019s board shortly after taking office, despite Brazil\u2019s securities and exchange committee deeming them ineligible: one is a politician; the other works for the energy ministry. More worryingly, Lula\u2019s intervention also goes further than his predecessor. Jean Paul Prates, the new CEO, supported a campaign promise Lula made to \u201cBrazilianise\u201d fuel prices\u2014meaning to lower them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In May the firm announced changes to its pricing policy that lowered the cost of diesel and fuel prices from its refineries by 12%, and cooking gas by a fifth. Though Petrobras does have leeway to lower prices within market parameters by using its own refineries more, the new pricing policy is confusing. Adriano Pires, an energy analyst in Rio de Janeiro, calls it \u201ca black box\u201d. Markets reacted positively to the announcement not because of the policy\u2019s merits, but because they had been expecting more intervention. It is unclear how the policy will work when oil prices rise."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet even this was not enough. Alexandre Silveira, the energy minister, has repeatedly criticised Mr Prates for not lowering prices more. Petrobras\u2019s blockbuster new business plan appears to respond to pressures from Lula to boost local jobs, diversify into renewable energy and expand Petrobras\u2019s reach abroad. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government is also trying to reverse Petrobras\u2019s divestment policy. Petrobras\u2019s big new investment plan includes an 80% increase in investments for refineries, transport and marketing. In November Petrobras cancelled the $34m sale of a refinery it had agreed to sell in 2020, claiming that the terms of the contract had not been fulfilled. The purchaser, Grepar, is demanding compensation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is unlikely the government will stop there. Partly as a result of the corruption investigations after 2014, Petrobras signed a deal with Brazil\u2019s antitrust body in which it pledged to sell eight of its 13 refineries in the country in order to reduce its dominant market share. It had put four of these up for sale, including the one bought by Grepar, and was preparing to let go of the other half, too. In November the government asked the antitrust body to review the agreements on the sale of refineries. Mr Prates says that Petrobras\u2019s ownership of refineries is not monopolistic and that \u201cit\u2019s a false obligation to sell those refineries\u201d. Petrobras is currently in negotiations to take back partial control of a refinery that was sold to Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund in 2021, and which accounts for 10% of Brazil\u2019s oil-refining capacity. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lula\u2019s recent moves suggest he has not learned from past failures. On January 18th he announced that Petrobras would expand a refinery in his home state of Pernambuco that has been mired in scandal for years. Lula suggested the reason the refinery was incomplete was because the United States does not want Brazil to become an oil power and was in cahoots with anti-corruption prosecutors. In fact, in 2016 a federal court determined that the cost of building the refinery had been inflated by a fifth. It never operated at capacity and caused Petrobras to lose over $3bn. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other unsettling signs abound. Last March Ricardo Lewandowski, then a judge on Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court, suspended a section of the \u201cstate-owned companies law\u201d, thus allowing national firms to appoint politicians to leadership roles if they want to. (Mr Lewandowski is now justice minister.) Minority shareholders on Petrobras\u2019s board resisted changing the company bylaws, but in November the government overpowered them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Prates said the change was \u201cinnocuous\u201d because it simply aligns Petrobras\u2019s bylaws with a change in federal law. But Marcelo Mesquita, the representative of minority shareholders on the board, disagrees. \u201cAs an isolated case, this may not be a scandal. But it is the beginning of a \u2018let\u2019s see [how much we can get away with]\u2019 approach. It shows the government is worried about something.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Brazil is unlikely to experience the kind of gigantic corruption scandal it did in 2014. The firm\u2019s compliance mechanisms are stronger. The scandal traumatised Petrobras employees, making them more vigilant to graft among higher-ups. In addition, the government has less power over Petrobras than other Latin American governments do over their national oil firms. Despite it having the controlling vote on the board, the vast majority of capital in Petrobras comes from private stakeholders. Mr Pires thinks the problem with Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party is that it \u201ctreats Petrobras as if it were 100% state-owned.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though it is unlikely that Petrobras will plummet to the depths it did a decade ago, the government\u2019s recent moves could undermine the company\u2019s hard-won success.
