X was just a letter in the alphabet. Elon Musk was preoccupied with implanting computer chips into pigs. Donald Trump wasn\u2019t yet banned, though his tweets were loud, alarming\u2014and getting fact-checked by the platform itself. Tired of liberal big-tech companies telling them what they could post, some Republicans had started to defect to a rival platform launched two years earlier: Parler. It looked similar to Twitter, but with less content moderation. More began to announce their migration from the nest with the hashtag #Twexit. \u201cHey @twitter, your days are numbered,\u201d tweeted Brad Parscale, then Mr Trump\u2019s campaign manager, with a link to Parler.

Messages exchanged on Parler have been presented in court as evidence to convict rioters who broke into the Capitol on January 6th 2021. Misinformation and far-right conspiracy theories shared on the platform came to the fore. The app was taken off the Apple and Google app stores (although it was later restored). A legal battle with Amazon Web Services, the cloud platform that hosted Parler, ensued. For a brief moment in 2022 Kanye West, a controversial rapper, attempted to buy it. The app eventually went down altogether. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now it is promising a \u201cbig comeback\u201d after being acquired by PDS Partners, a Texas-based company.

Shortly after the insurrection, the platform\u2019s previous ownership denounced \u201cBig Tech\u2019s scapegoating of Parler\u201d in a letter to the House Oversight Committee (HOC) and said that Parler had shared concerns about violent activity with law enforcement before January 6th."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cMany people organised to be at that event on all different platforms,\u201d says Elise Pierotti, the firm\u2019s returning chief marketing officer. \u201cParler was the only one that was scrutinised.\u201d Ms Pierotti, who claims that Parler\u2019s move to return in an election year is coincidental and that the firm is \u201cnot thinking about politics\u201d, says that the platform will allow users to say that the 2020 election was stolen (\u201cbecause that is a personal opinion\u201d) and that mail-in ballots are fraudulent. \u201cWhen it comes to open discussion, or people presenting, you know, different ideas, that\u2019s not up to us.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Parler is not the only fringe platform to have won favour among those on the right, but it is the best-known.

Social media\u2019s ability to influence extreme political acts is notoriously difficult to quantify. Several papers published since January 6th 2021 have begun to paint a more nuanced picture of the link between platforms of all stripes, polarisation and violence. Parler\u2019s unique contribution to January 6th is \u201cvery unclear\u201d, reckons Daniel Karell, a sociology professor at Yale University who co-authored a study on Parler, platforms like it and civil unrest. He found that while it is unlikely someone could have been radicalised by posts on Parler alone, the platform did attract like-minded people with extreme views and gave them a space to affirm each other\u2019s ideas. In other words, a loosely moderated forum made storming the Capitol seem almost like a normal thing to do.

One thing supersedes the power of content moderation altogether: the charismatic figure that rallies others to their cause (or social platform of choice). Ms Donovan says her own research into networked incitement has found a common thread among those who were arrested at the Capitol: \u201cthey came because Trump asked them to, very simple.\u201d Whether Parler\u2019s user base will return or grow remains to be seen.
