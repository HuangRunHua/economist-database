For one thing, they have minds and legs of their own. \u201cThey are known to occasionally make themselves at home on other people\u2019s sofas,\u201d acknowledged Mark Spencer, a government minister, to a committee of MPs on January 31st. The facts of feline behaviour have not deterred the government from backing a new bill that will make the \u201cabduction\u201d of a pet cat or dog punishable by up to five years in prison. The act of \u201cinducing\u201d a cat (perhaps with a tin of sardines) will also be caught by the new offence."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The problem with the bill, which is sponsored by Anna Firth, a Conservative backbencher, is not only, as a government \u201cpet-theft taskforce\u201d found, that public fears of this dastardly act far outweigh its actual incidence. It is that stealing is already punishable under the Theft Act of 1968 by up to seven years in prison, and that the stiffest sentences are already handed out for crimes that cause emotional distress. Ministers used to argue as much themselves until they yielded to a campaign by pet lobbyists. For when it comes to tackling an injustice that is already against the law, the answer can be simple: ban it harder. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "What is true for cats and dogs is also true for war memorials. Vandalism has long been a crime. But in 2022, amid concern that activists might topple monuments to contentious historical figures, Parliament created a new provision of \u201ccriminal damage to memorials\u201d, punishable by up to ten years in prison. More is to come. Cops already have broad powers to tackle \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d and people \u201ccausing public nuisance\u201d. Still, the Metropolitan Police\u2019s hands-off approach to recent pro-Palestinian protests in London led the government to announce on February 8th that it would seek to make \u201cclimbing on war memorials a specific public order offence\u201d, punishable by three months in prison. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Britain is in the grip of a bad bout of statutory inflation, in which public demand for tough new laws outstrips the supply of social ills that have not yet been legislated upon. The result is lawmaking that renders the already illegal even more illegal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This sort of legislative micromanagement would have appalled the version of the Conservative Party that David Cameron led in opposition during the 2000s. The defence of liberties against the authoritarian culture of New Labour was a big theme of the party\u2019s 2010 manifesto. \u201cLabour continues to use ever more new legislation as a kind of rhetorical tool, a parliamentary squawk to indicate its attitudes, while totally neglecting to use and enforce the existing law,\u201d wrote one Boris Johnson, then a Tory backbencher and star columnist, in 2006 of the proposed offence of \u201cglorifying terrorism\u201d. A noble sentiment and one Mr Johnson had completely forgotten by 2019, when he put forward a law that states, with epic redundancy: \u201cIt is recognised that the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Banning it harder is eye-catching, free and reassuringly tough, which is why Labour is still keen on the tactic. Questionable procurement during the covid-19 pandemic has become a running sore for the government, so Labour is considering a new offence of \u201cfraud against the public purse\u201d. Yet fraud is already a crime. So is assault, but that has not deterred Labour from proposing a \u201cnew specific offence of assault against retail workers\u201d in response to a wave of increasingly violent shoplifting. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such measures can have unanticipated consequences. The problem with offering certain occupations a special legal protection from violent crime was apparent after a similar law was introduced in Scotland in 2021; soon groups representing cabbies and bus drivers lobbied for provisions of their own. New offences are also a clumsy tool for serious problems. Spiking, in which a victim\u2019s drink is drugged in order to rob or assault them, is a terrifying crime. It was already prosecutable under seven separate offences before the Home Office proposed legal amendments in December 2023 to show \u201cwithout any doubt, spiking is illegal\u201d. But the reason why prosecutions are rare, and the true scale of spiking hard to define, is because hospitals do not routinely test for drugs in emergency wards. A new offence is unlikely to change that. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Syntax error"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ban-it-harderism may nonetheless seem harmless. Britons like their pets; they do not, as a rule, like their politicians. Reasserting existing laws in a loud voice is a more benign way to bridge the gap between governing and governed than, say, stirring a trade war with China. Yet it is a symptom of two malaises in British politics."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first concerns the role of MPs. Ms Firth told the Commons that, for one constituent, the loss of her dogs (Mandy, Micky, Ruby and Chara) had been \u201cas if her babies had been taken\u201d. Parliament, too, has been infantilised. MPs\u2019 time is misallocated. They are increasingly incentivised to think of themselves as super-councillors, tasked with sorting out constituency casework and championing local causes, rather than as national legislators. It is a brave MP who tells constituents that their idea for a bill, prompted by a local tragedy, would be an unhelpful complication to existing law. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second malaise concerns law enforcement. The police response to pet theft is \u201cvirtually non-existent\u201d, said Ms Firth. If incidents of kittynapping were logged under a separate law, she argues, officers would take it more seriously. That logic is a common thread through bills to ban it harder. MPs have little visibility or control over the police, who are operationally independent. Restating the law in increasingly specific terms is a blunt attempt to jolt the police into affording certain offences a higher priority. It is akin to pounding the keyboard of a frozen computer in the hope of stirring it to life. The problem is that the list of crimes which overstretched and undermanaged police forces struggle to solve\u2014rape, burglary, online fraud\u2014is long. Cat theft is a low priority because much graver crimes are competing for attention. It is possible to ban things harder. They cannot all come first. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Bagehot, our columnist on British politics: The former prime minister who fascinates the Labour Party (Feb 8th)The search for Conservative Party unity (Feb 1st)Britain\u2019s Labour Party is backed by a pro-growth coalition (Jan 25th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Bagehot column got its name"}], "id": 50}
