Indonesia has the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, but it is almost bewilderingly diverse. Islam is just one of six officially recognised religions.

Sukarno, the first president, initially led a fissiparous parliamentary democracy but declared martial law in 1957. Thereafter he presided over an authoritarian \u201cguided democracy\u201d, backed by the army. In 1965 a failed coup, which the army blamed on the Communist Party, gave it an excuse to take power directly. Suharto, a general, ousted Sukarno and ruled as a dictator for the next 32 years, a period of both political repression and rapid economic development. The CIA has described the massacres of communists that took place under Suharto as \u201cone of the worst mass murders of the 20th century\u201d. They continue to haunt the country. Unrest brought his rule to an end, leading to the restoration of democracy and the beginning of a more hopeful period of \u201creformasi\u201d. But Indonesia\u2019s democracy is an imperfect one, in which politicians exchange favours for political support. On February 14th Indonesia, the world\u2019s third-largest democracy, elected a new president, Prabowo Subianto. He will succeed the popular Joki Widodo, known as Jokowi.

Ms Pisani sleeps under a tree with a family of nomads who wear little more than loincloths, rubs shoulders with the bohemian glitterati of Jakarta, the capital, and has tea with a young man and the body of his deceased grandmother, who were receiving visitors before her funeral. Ms Pisani paints a portrait of a country that is democratic and diverse. Different \u201cgroups are essentially living at different points in human history, all at the same time\u201d, she writes. She also shows that Indonesia is prey to corruption and to the malign influence of patronage networks. Like any traveller in Indonesia Ms Pisani experienced the unstinting generosity of its people. She describes them vividly and with affection. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Liem Sioe Liong\u2019s Salim Group. By Richard Borsuk and Nancy Chng.

These have become bigger and more complicated over time. Many are run by the third or fourth generation of their founding families. To understand how business and politics intersect, read \u201cLiem Sioe Liong\u2019s Salim Group\u201d. The book relates the history of Indonesia under Suharto using as its frame the commercial conglomerate that was then the country\u2019s most powerful. It traces the life of Liem Sioe Liong, who was born poor in China and escaped conscription by fleeing to Indonesia on a cargo ship. He built the Salim Group, which has interests in many industries, including construction, coal and forestry. It owns Indomie, one of the world\u2019s biggest makers of instant noodles. Enriched by interviews with Liem and his son Anthony, who inherited the business, this is the best history yet of the sort of Indonesian conglomerate that remains a central player in the country.

Pramoedya Ananta Toer first told the novel\u2019s story, set in Java in the final years of Dutch colonial rule, to his cellmates. Eventually, after he was allowed to write, Catholic priests and other visitors smuggled his papers out of the penal colony. The quartet\u2019s protagonist is Minke, a journalist and revolutionary who comes of age as Indonesian nationalism begins to spread. An everyman of sorts, Minke befriends characters who exemplify the kaleidoscope of Indonesia, from the formidable concubine of a crazed Dutch man to a working-class soldier turned servant. The Buru Quartet was published after Pramoedya\u2019s release in 1979 but Suharto\u2019s government banned its sale. Even though the ban was lifted in 2010, high schools do not include Pramoedya\u2019s works in their curriculums. That omission shows how nervous the government remains about his Marxist ideology. The author was widely thought to be South-East Asia\u2019s leading candidate to win the Nobel prize for literature, though he did not receive it before his death in 2006."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Race, Islam and Power: Ethnic and Religious Violence in Post-Suharto Indonesia.

The country did become more liberal: Indonesians were freer to practise their religions and speak their languages. At the same time, politicians increasingly used Islam to accumulate power, argues Andreas Harsono in this travelogue. \u201cRace, Islam and Power\u201d examines religious and ethnic tensions since the fall of Suharto, which sometimes led to violence across the archipelago, from Aceh, the only province with sharia law, to West Papua, where conflict continues between Papuan separatists and the government. A culture of impunity \u201cexpresses itself in a systematic failure to hold accountable members of the security forces and Islamist militants who commit abuses against religious and gender minorities across Indonesia\u201d, Mr Harsono writes. He takes readers back to the Indonesian revolution, introduces them to Nahdlatul Ulama, the world\u2019s largest Muslim organisation, and interviews pilgrims at Sukarno\u2019s grave. Although Mr Harsono\u2019s prose is occasionally wooden, the book is a readable account of the ways that Islam has shaped Indonesia and been shaped by it.

But in 1966 Indonesia\u2019s armed forces killed at least 80,000 Balinese, 5% of the island\u2019s population, many of them on the beaches. They were among 500,000-1m suspected communists slaughtered by the army between 1965 and 1968. Many were not in fact communists. \u201cThe Jakarta Method\u201d tells this history in the context of the cold war. America viewed Indonesia, which had the largest Communist Party outside China and the Soviet Union, as the biggest of the South-East Asian \u201cdominoes\u201d that could fall to a communist revolution, Vincent Bevins writes. The American government gave the army lists of supposed communists to be murdered. Mr Bevins uses interviews with survivors and declassified documents to trace the history of America\u2019s interference not just in Indonesia but across South-East Asia and in Latin America. The offensive against the Indonesian communists succeeded. The party\u2019s liquidation by government decree in 1966 \u201cgreatly reduced America\u2019s stakes in Vietnam\u201d, where America was fighting a war to prevent a communist takeover, Mr Bevins writes. Indonesia is still feeling the consequences of America\u2019s cold-war machinations. Although communists have little political influence, anti-communism helps justify the power exercised by a few rich families."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Question of Red. By Laksmi Pamuntjak.
