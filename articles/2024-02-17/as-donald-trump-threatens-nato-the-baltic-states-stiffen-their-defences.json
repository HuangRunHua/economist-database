Mr Trump\u2019s message jangled already frayed nerves: in recent weeks, a succession of European defence ministers and spy chiefs have warned that war with Russia is more likely and closer than assumed in the past. \u201cIt cannot be ruled out that within a three- to five-year period, Russia will test Article 5 and NATO\u2019s solidarity,\u201d warned Troels Lund Poulsen, Denmark\u2019s defence minister, on February 9th. \u201cThat was not nato\u2018s assessment in 2023.

As Ukrainian forces slowed down to clear mines, bridge ditches and bulldoze obstacles, they were observed by drones and hit with a hail of anti-tank missiles and suicide drones. So uncharted was this territory that Valery Zaluzhny, then Ukraine\u2019s top general, asked his staff to dig out \u201cBreaching Fortified Defence Lines\u201d, a book by a Soviet major-general. It was published in 1941."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Estonian officials estimate their stretch of the border will need some 600 concrete bunkers, each capable of holding around ten soldiers and taking a hit from a large shell. Prototype bunkers are being developed and construction is expected to start next year, at a cost of around \u20ac60m ($65m). The aim is not to create an impregnable fortress but to slow invaders, wear them down and buy time to bring up reinforcements. If Latvia and Lithuania were to build bunkers at a similar density, they would need 1,116 and 2,758 bunkers respectively, calculates Lukas Milevski of Leiden University in the Netherlands."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The catch is not military engineering but democratic consent. \u201cThe most important part is agreement with landowners,\u201d says Susan Lillevali, an Estonian defence official, noting that most of the borderlands are privately owned.

Locals may be reassured by the fact that the armed forces do not plan to store explosives near the strongholds in peacetime, nor install anti-personnel landmines, which are illegal under the Ottawa Treaty."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Baltic bunker-building spree is part of a wider revival of interest in fortification. In November Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, urged his commanders to accelerate the construction of defences in the east.

This throws up a dilemma."}, {"role": "body", "text": "NATO armies have long preferred a more elastic defence in depth, in which forces retreat as needed and destroy the enemy on more favourable terrain. That is incompatible with defending every inch of nato soil.

In short: heavy bombardment of Russian soil. \u201cWestern political leaders,\u201d he warns, \u201cmay be squeamish about such attacks.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 41}
