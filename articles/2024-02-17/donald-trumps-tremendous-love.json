For the man presents himself as being full of it. He is associated with a politics of grievance and retribution that has boiled over at times into violence, most infamously in the attack on the Capitol on January 6th 2021. And yet no other president, or presidential candidate, has so wreathed himself in valentines. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In speeches and blast emails, Mr Trump romances his supporters with constant reminders of his love.

His heart often has reasons of which reason would appear to know nothing. Like Titania he has tumbled for the most improbable of creatures (\u201cWe fell in love,\u201d he gushed of North Korea\u2019s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un). Like Rihanna he has found love in hopeless places, including the Soviet Union (\u201cyou could see it was a country where there was a lot of love\u201d) and even in that crowd on January 6th (\u201cThere was a lot of love out there. There was tremendous love\u201d)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pretty much by definition, presidents are not normal people. But even by their abnormal standard Mr Trump is an unusual character. His detractors like to point out that he had a head start in life as the son of a millionaire real-estate developer. They may not give him enough credit, though, for how through daring, determination and a certain ethical flexibility he willed himself into becoming a billionaire, a flamboyant celebrity, a reality-television star and then the president\u2014how, like F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s Jay Gatsby, Donald Trump \u201csprang from his Platonic conception of himself\u201d.
