Mr Everett, a professor of English literature at the University of Southern California, is known for producing genre-defying works, ranging from a satire of the publishing industry that inspired the film \u201cAmerican Fiction\u201d to a murder mystery about lynchings in the American South. (\u201cThe Trees\u201d was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2022.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In retelling Twain\u2019s classic American tale with a twist, Mr Everett joins a long tradition of writers who have dragged marginalised characters into the centre of new (old) tales. The modern trend began with \u201cWide Sargasso Sea\u201d (1966), when Jean Rhys gave a voice to Mr Rochester\u2019s wife, the \u201cmadwoman in the attic\u201d, from \u201cJane Eyre\u201d by Charlotte Bront\u00eb."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Two types of retellings have been popular recently. One involves feminist revisions of books focused on men. \u201cCirce\u201d (2018) by Madeline Miller retold the \u201cOdyssey\u201d from the perspective of Circe, a minor goddess; Pat Barker\u2019s \u201cThe Silence of the Girls\u201d (also 2018) imagined the \u201cIliad\u201d from the viewpoint of a Trojan queen taken as a slave by Achilles. Last year \u201cJulia\u201d by Sandra Newman retold George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d, offering meat and mind to a previously scrawny character. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cJames\u201d is an example of another sort of retelling, which gives prominence to non-white characters from tales previously focused on white ones. This is not entirely new: in \u201cThe Wind Done Gone\u201d (2001), Alice Randall rewrote Margaret Mitchell\u2019s \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d from a slave\u2019s perspective. As readers demand fresh perspectives, more authors are trying their hand at adaptations. Successful ones do not just tweak familiar stories but create something entirely new, therefore reading as original and defiant. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The shift from Huck\u2019s perspective to Jim\u2019s is such an act. Consider the opening scene. In Twain\u2019s original novel, first published in America in 1885 (and banned in Massachusetts shortly afterwards because of its bad language), the boys sneak up on Jim to \u201cplay something on him\u201d. They see him as dumb and superstitious. (The N-word appears around 200 times in the novel, which has made the book a frequent flashpoint in schools.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The brilliance of Mr Everett\u2019s retelling is to imagine Jim\u2019s interiority while maintaining the integrity of Twain\u2019s scene. Jim sees the boys in the grass but pretends not to. His narration is intelligent and witty, but when he speaks aloud, he plays dumb. With a few lines, Mr Everett has turned Twain\u2019s tale on its head. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cJames\u201d unfolds in this fashion, making familiar scenes feel startling and new. You do not need to read the original to enjoy the revision, however; Mr Everett\u2019s tale stands on its own. As in Twain\u2019s novel, Jim runs away to avoid being sold to a new slave-owner and separated from his family. Huck fakes his death to get away from his abusive father. The unlikely pair escape by raft down the Mississippi river, encountering all kinds of dangers and obstacles on their journey. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Jim, who has secretly taught himself to read and write, finds paper and ink. \u201cI am called Jim,\u201d he writes. \u201cI have yet to choose a name.\u201d He discusses morality with Huck, who wonders if he\u2019s \u201cdoin\u2019 wrong\u201d by helping Jim escape. \u201cIf\u2019n ya need sum kinda God to tells ya right from wrong, den you won\u2019t never know,\u201d Jim advises wisely. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Mr Everett\u2019s telling, Jim\u2019s slave dialect is a put-on. He drops it around other slaves, but reverts to \u201clawdy, lawdy\u201d when a white person appears. \u201cWhite folks expect us to sound a certain way and it can only help if we don\u2019t disappoint them,\u201d he explains. He advises slave children to mumble, sound stupid and use \u201ccorrect incorrect grammar\u201d. Making whites feel safe and superior is a matter of survival. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Jim and Huck are separated, Mr Everett invents new trials for Jim that are darker and bloodier than anything in Twain\u2019s text. The central thread, however, remains the relationship between the runaway slave and the boy. Huck protects Jim in the wilderness, but Jim also feels responsible for Huck, who grows increasingly uncomfortable with slavery. Toward the end, Mr Everett introduces a twist, as well as action-packed scenes of revenge that read like they are destined for re-enactment on the big screen. \u201cMy name is James,\u201d Jim declares at one point. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my family.\u201d (You can almost hear the dramatic score that will accompany these lines and might wonder which actor will play Jim.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whether or not \u201cJames\u201d is a commercial success, the trend of retellings is only likely to continue. Writers have always looked to classic tales to comment on contemporary times. Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHamlet\u201d adapted the Danish legend of Amleth. Milton\u2019s \u201cParadise Lost\u201d rewrote the Bible\u2019s Book of Genesis. Readers love the comfort of a familiar story remixed with surprising twists and provocative insights. For publishers, that makes retellings a good bet\u2014easy to market and sure to sell. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 74}
