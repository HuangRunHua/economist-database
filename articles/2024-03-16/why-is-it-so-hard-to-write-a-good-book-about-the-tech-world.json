"}, {"role": "body", "text": "One is \u201cThe Studio\u201d (1969) by John Gregory Dunne, an American writer who spent a year inside 20th Century Fox watching films get made and executives try to balance creativity with profit-seeking. The other, \u201cSwimming Across\u201d (2001) by Andy Grove, a former boss of Intel, a chipmaker, is a memoir about surviving the Holocaust. It shows how adversity can engender grit, which every entrepreneur needs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That Sir Michael does not suggest a book squarely about the tech business says a lot. Silicon Valley has produced some of the world\u2019s most gargantuan companies, but it has not inspired many written accounts with a long shelf life. Wall Street, by contrast, claims a small canon that has stood the test of time, from chronicles of meltdowns (\u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d), to corporate greed (\u201cBarbarians at the Gate\u201d) to a fictionalised account (\u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities\u201d) that popularised the term \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Why not the masters of Silicon Valley? Part of the problem is access, as is often the case when writing about the powerful. Tech executives may let their guards down at Burning Man, but they have been painstakingly trained by public-relations staff not to get burned by writers. This has been the case for a while. When John Battelle was writing \u201cThe Search\u201d (2005), about online quests for information, he spent over a year asking to interview Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page. The firm tried to impose conditions, such as the right to read the manuscript in advance and add a footnote and possible rebuttal to every mention of Google. He declined. Google ended up granting the interview anyway. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Journalists who manage to finagle access can feel they owe a company and its executives and, in turn, write meek and sympathetic accounts rather than penetrating prose. Or they cannot break in\u2014or do not even try\u2014and write their book from a distance, without an insider\u2019s insights. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Two new books demonstrate how hard it is to write well about Silicon Valley. \u201cFilterworld\u201d is an outsider\u2019s account of the Valley\u2019s impact, which reads as if it was entirely reported and written in a coffee shop in Brooklyn. The book laments how \u201cculture is stuck and plagued by sameness\u201d and blames Silicon Valley\u2019s algorithms, \u201cthe technological spectre haunting our own era of the early 21st century\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is the sort of tirade against tech that has spread as widely as Silicon Valley\u2019s apps. It is not wrong, but nor is it insightful. The author, Kyle Chayka, who is a journalist for the New Yorker, never reconciles the tension between the cultural \u201csameness\u201d he decries and the personalisation everyone experiences, with online users possessing individual feeds and living in separate information bubbles. Nor is this a wholly new phenomenon. People have been complaining about globalisation eroding local culture since \u201crecorded civilisation\u201d began, the author concedes. In 1890 Gabriel Tarde, a French sociologist, lamented the \u201cpersistent sameness in hotel fare and service, in household furniture, in clothes and jewellery, in theatrical notices and in the volumes in shop windows\u201d that spread with the passenger train."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cBurn Book\u201d is a better, though imperfect, read. Kara Swisher, a veteran chronicler of Silicon Valley, is both an insider and an outsider. She has attended baby showers for tech billionaires\u2019 offspring and even hosted Google\u2019s top brass for a sleepover at her mother\u2019s apartment. But she has a distaste for the Valley\u2019s \u201clook-at-me narcissists, who never met an idea that they did not try to take credit for\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In delicious detail, she offers her verdict on the techies who have become household names, such as Facebook\u2019s founder: \u201cAs sweat poured down Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pasty and rounded face, I wondered if he was going to keel over right there at my feet.\u201d That was in 2010, before he had gone through media-training galore. Much as Truman Capote, an American writer, was willing to skewer the socialite swans of New York, Ms Swisher delights in prodding some of her subjects to make readers smile and squirm, such as media mogul Rupert Murdoch (\u201cUncle Satan\u201d) and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos (who has \u201ca genuinely infectious maniacal laugh\u201d)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Swisher does not have Capote\u2019s \u00e9lan, but her book succeeds where many fail because she explores the relationship between subject and writer, which lurks in the background of most tech books. In detailing her interactions with tech bosses over three decades, she shows how the industry became more furtive and destructive, less free and fun. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "While Ms Swisher uses her memoir to hold up a mirror, unfortunately she does not gaze at it long. After chronicling the internet for the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and her own outfit, Recode, she moved from the Valley to the swamp\u2014Washington, DC\u2014acknowledging that \u201cI had become too much a creature of the place\u201d and \u201cpart of the scene in a way that was starting to feel uncomfortable\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, she declines to tease out some of the more complicated aspects of covering the Valley, such as the thin line between source, friend and adviser, and exactly how she covered the Valley dispassionately when her then-wife was a Google executive. Despite her journalistic ferocity, the reality was that Ms Swisher could not eviscerate many of her subjects, because she depended on them accepting her invitation to speak at her annual conference, one of her major sources of income, and on her podcast. She was not just \u201cpart of the scene\u201d\u2014she played a leading role. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Of course, journalists are not the only ones who deal with personal conflicts that affect how and what they write about tech. Too many in the Valley pursue books to buttress their personal brand, like a website or r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that just happens to have a spine (but reads as spineless). This explains why so many venture capitalists have ventured into book-writing. The best of the lot is \u201cZero to One\u201d (2014) by Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, and Blake Masters, a student who took a class taught by Mr Thiel at Stanford. However, explaining how to build a monopoly, as it does with welcome and rare frankness, is probably something Mr Thiel and his peers regret, considering the scrutiny Silicon Valley has since elicited from regulators. Monopolies are not so in vogue these days."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the simplest explanation for why it is so hard for a book about Silicon Valley to hit the mark is probably the most obvious: timing. The snail\u2019s pace of research and publishing is badly suited to Silicon Valley\u2019s speed. Today\u2019s pressing book idea is next year\u2019s stale one. Innovation cycles and companies\u2019 futures often pivot too quickly. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Take Adam Lashinsky, a journalist who wrote a book about Uber. He watched as the company faltered and tried to keep his text up to date. His aptly titled \u201cWild Ride\u201d was published in 2017, a month before the dramatic firing of Uber\u2019s boss, Travis Kalanick. Mr Lashinsky has since sworn off writing about tech. His next book is about William Safire, a dead newspaper columnist. It is a subject that will not go out of date\u2014and not try to control the narrative. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 71}
