The farms around Dhaid provide a splash of green, but homegrown food is scarce, homegrown staples next to non-existent. Drinkable water comes mostly from desalination plants. The heat is growing inhumane; outside work is banned during the hottest hours of summer afternoons. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Emiratis know their predicament. The gleaming cities of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah are fully aware of the threats of sea-level rise. As you reach the Persian Gulf you can see a coast-protecting carbon-sequestering ribbon made up of millions of mangroves, their seeds planted by drone. At the same time those gleaming cities are built on oil. The UAE produces about 3m barrels of oil per day (bpd) and the state-owned producer, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), hopes to increase its production capacity to 5m bpd by 2030. The UAE is a major force in OPEC, the cartel of oil-producing nations. It is a hub for oil traders, too. In 2021, the Intercontinental Exchange, a commodity exchange with big operations in Europe, America and Asia, started trading a new oil futures contract for regional crudes delivered in Fujairah. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The emirates are thus the world in microcosm. The disastrous hazards of climate change are manifest. The oil industry has never been bigger. When demand slumped during the covid-19 pandemic some hoped that it would never return to its previous heights. But it has since surpassed them. In 2023 the world produced 101.8m bpd, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Carbon-dioxide emissions from oil in that year are estimated to have reached 12.1bn tonnes a year, according to the Global Carbon Project, an academic consortium, representing 32% of all industrial emissions. Any attempt to keep the increase in average global temperature since the 19th century \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C [3.6\u00b0F]\u201d, as required by the Paris agreement of 2015, has to see those emissions reduced both sharply and soon. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "No one is being forced to buy oil (though in many places people receive subsidies to help them do so). And every economy needs it. Nevertheless, many of those pushing for emission cuts have a deep distrust of the industry which provides it to the world. That the oil industry has an interest in self preservation is hardly surprising. But it also has a history of attempting to undermine climate science so as to encourage climate-change denial even while its own scientists have known full well what was going on. It wields huge lobbying power which frequently (infuriatingly so, to opponents) prevails when climate action threatens its future profits. Oil companies which try to seem like climate goody-goodies\u2014witness the attempt by BP, a British oil major, to rebrand itself as Beyond Petroleum in the 2000s\u2014routinely revert to type when the associated business strategies fail to deliver the goods.

When, in November 2023, thousands of diplomats, politicians, scientists, entrepreneurs, lobbyists and journalists arrived in Dubai for COP28 many did so itching for a fight about this, their indignation whipped up by the UAE\u2019s decision to appoint Sultan al-Jaber, the boss of ADNOC, as the COP\u2019s president.

If, or as, that happens, the questions of the past\u2014where will new supply come from, and how secure will it be\u2014become further complicated by new worries: who will stop supplying, and what effect will that have.
