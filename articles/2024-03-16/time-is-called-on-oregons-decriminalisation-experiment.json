But Gifford\u2019s Flowers, in downtown Portland, has been going through it of late. It\u2019s been broken into three times and employees have been attacked and even bitten, says Jim Gifford, who has been running the store for half a century. Mr Gifford blames Oregon\u2019s decriminalisation of the possession of drugs, which, he says, has led to more \u201cpeople in drug episodes\u201d coming to his shop. \u201cA blue city in a blue state should be leading,\u201d the lifelong progressive Democrat says. \u201cBut also not forgetting about the people that work hard and play by the rules.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2020 Oregonians voted to decriminalise the possession of small amounts of hard drugs, including fentanyl, methamphetamine and heroin. It was the first (and so far only) state in the country to do so. The change was a massive experiment in treating addiction as a public-health problem. But the state has now concluded that the experiment failed. This month, in the face of ever-increasing overdose rates and public complaints such as Mr Gifford\u2019s, the Democratic-controlled legislature overwhelmingly passed a measure recriminalising the possession of drugs. The governor, Tina Kotek, has said she will sign it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Overdose deaths have spiked in Oregon, increasing by 42% in the year to September 2023 (compared with a national increase of 2%). Researchers disagree on how much decriminalisation versus the spread in fentanyl is to blame, but none thinks that the state\u2019s experiment managed to decrease deaths. Oregonians are frustrated. Open-air drug use has become particularly blatant."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The replacement law makes the possession of a small amount of drugs a misdemeanour crime punishable by up to 180 days in jail. It does provide paths to addiction care, by offering drug offenders the chance to go directly to detox facilities instead of jail (and to try it again if the first time doesn\u2019t work). \u201cIt\u2019s time to reset our guardrails,\u201d Andy Mendenhall, the head of Central City Concern, an addiction-services provider in Portland, told lawmakers.
