Pressure from Russia, one of ten countries that align themselves with opec\u2019s policies to form what is known as OPEC+, for a higher production quota was faced down in April, when it agreed instead to cut production along with the rest of the cartel. A squabble between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which had demanded an increase in its quotas to accommodate a planned big expansion in production capacity, was resolved in June."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then, in a surprise move, Saudi Arabia announced a further, unilateral 1m bpd cut in its own oil production from July. This \u201clollipop\u201d, as it was termed by Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the self-confident Saudi energy minister, was intended to further shore up prices to the benefit of its fellow cartel members. It was a welcome sweetener. 2022 had been a bumper year with OPEC\u2019s net oil exports totalling $888bn, a real increase of 31% over the pre-pandemic figure three years earlier. But soft demand, especially from China, and lower oil prices were taking the edge off. In the end OPEC\u2019s net oil export revenues in 2023 dropped to $656bn."}, {"role": "body", "text": " \u201cSaudi Arabia has played its cards very well,\u201d Christyan Malek of JPMorgan Chase, a bank, observed at the time. With opec+ controlling 40% of the world\u2019s oil production, the card sense of the cartel\u2019s dominant power matters a lot. Saudi Arabia\u2019s clout within the cartel comes not so much from the level of its production (Russia produces roughly as much), but more from its singular willingness to allow significant capacity to sit idle. As the swing producer it can stabilise or raise prices by reducing production or soften the market by increasing it. Lower prices cause disproportionate harm to producers whose costs are higher than the kingdom\u2019s\u2014that is, to almost all the rest of the cartel."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That clout does not come cheap. In 2022 Saudi Aramco posted profits of $161bn, the largest ever seen at a publicly listed firm. The lollipop was one reason that the quarterly profits it reported in November 2023 were nearly a quarter lower year-on-year. Production capacity is costly. Spare capacity is, in the short term, money left on the table. Saudi Arabia\u2019s post-lollipop 9m bpd leaves it 3m bpd below what it could be producing\u2014roughly equivalent to the entire production of Kuwait.

They act \u201cas a kind of beneficial central bank for oil supply\u201d, he says, \u201cwith price stability [the] primary objective.\u201d Others are less charitable. Saudi Arabia has twice flooded the market to lower prices, in 1986 so as to punish the cartel members who were not adhering to the cartel\u2019s production quotas, and in 2014 to hurt US shale-oil producers. In its attempt to squeeze a recalcitrant Russia into cutting production in 2020, when covid lockdowns were crashing demand, it kept its taps so open that oil prices became negative; for a short while traders had to pay for the stuff to be taken off their hands.

He says he would grade OPEC\u2019s stabilising of oil markets at between a B+ and a B-.

Daniel Yergin, author of a magisterial history of the oil business in the 20th century, \u201cThe Prize\u201d, says the shocking impact of the grouping\u2019s entry into geopolitics in 1973 came from three conditions being met at once.

The revelation of what oil could mean led to more countries deciding that the share of oil revenues they deserved was 100%.

On that basis, hardly a success. So that would be zero for two. And not much more than a decade after the first shock the cartel came a cropper when Saudi Arabia\u2019s attempt to discipline the market in 1986 sent the price plummeting to a third of what it had been.

The UAE is leaning into this. ADNOC has committed $23bn to decarbonisation projects, including $4bn for shipping onshore carbon-free electricity to power its offshore operations. The same money could be used to expand production. The emirates chose instead to produce more cleanly. Western oil majors are pursuing decarbonisation strategies because investors demand them. As with hosting the UN\u2019s COP28 climate conference, the UAE\u2019s aim is to be seen as supplier of choice in a climate-concerned world."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other members of OPEC+, and national oil companies (NOCs) beyond the cartel, cannot or do not want to be part of this trend. Many have reserves that are expensive to access (what the trade calls \u201chigh lifting costs\u201d) or have greenhouse-gas-intensive operations. Sonatrach, the Algerian noc, emits three to four times as much carbon-dioxide-equivalent per unit of oil and gas produced as do the goliaths of the Gulf. Whereas the oil majors in the West put about 15% of their capex into decarbonisation, Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, finds that on average state firms spend less than 5% of their capital that way, despite the efforts of outliers like the UAE and Malaysia, where Petronas plans to devote 20% of its capex to decarbonisation.

A recent analysis by the Natural Resources Governance Institute, an American watchdog, suggests that, of the $1.8trn that NOCs plan to invest over the next decade, $1.2trn is in projects which would not break even under the IEA\u2019s net-zero scenario.

A bit more is always welcome; you never know when it might be nice to supersize a football league.
