The oil and gas industry was the worst performing sector of America\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P 500 share index from 2010 to 2020, in large part due to the money-sucking shale boom. Since then the investor-owned firms have boosted efficiency, slashed costs and ditched assets.

For worries about supply being jeopardised by under-investment, in the near term it now makes more sense to look at the high-cost national oil companies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nevertheless, a recent survey by BCG, a consultancy, found that 84% of investors worldwide thought it important for oil and gas companies to demonstrate profitable growth from low-carbon investments by 2025.

Colombia\u2019s Ecopetrol and Thailand\u2019s PTT are also moving into renewables. Some European oil companies have tried similar shifts. Unfortunately, as a study by the Oxford Sustainable Finance Group points out, the project developers and utilities which dominate the renewables business typically pay less for their capital than oil companies, and so can make do with lower returns. It is in part because of their turn towards renewables that shares in European oil companies are trading at a hefty discount against their American peers.

BP is making investments in fossil fuels of which there was no inkling in its forecasts of a few years ago. Its hydrocarbon output in 2030 will be just 25% below the 2019 level, rather than the 40% it once touted. Shell\u2019s Mr Sawan told an investor day last year that the company is \u201cnot particularly differentiated\u201d in the renewables sector.

Tengku Muhammad Taufik, the boss of Malaysia\u2019s Petronas, wants to use the firm\u2019s many depleted oil fields to sequester carbon dioxide from across South-East Asia.

It will turn methane and water (in the form of steam) into 28m cubic metres (1bn cubic feet) of hydrogen a day and a smaller but still substantial flow of carbon dioxide.

ExxonMobil hopes to get the total amount of carbon dioxide it disposes of up to 50m tonnes a year by 2030 and twice that by 2040. In the long term, the company reckons that carbon-capture services, which it could sell to industry, and low-carbon businesses like hydrogen and biofuels could become a market in the \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d.

Pumping carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells can be a way of squeezing a lot more oil out of them, a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). If the carbon dioxide can be shown to stay down the well after the oil comes out, the companies involved can get a tax credit for carbon sequestration on top of the value of the oil recovered. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last July ExxonMobil paid $5bn to acquire Denbury, which owns a large pipeline network for getting carbon dioxide to wells that need their recovery enhanced. In August Occidental Petroleum, which is something of an EOR specialist, paid $1.1bn for Carbon Engineering, a Canadian startup which has developed technologies to extract carbon dioxide from thin air, a process called direct-air capture (DAC). Vicki Hollub, the chief executive of Oxy, as the company is known, has grand plans for this DAC technology. Oxy has received a grant from the American government worth up to $600m towards the $1bn-or-more required to build a commercial-scale DAC facility in Texas\u2014one capable of removing 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year.

Even climate hawks generous enough to overlook the oil industry\u2019s shameful history of promoting climate denialism it knew to be nonsense will be disturbed by the idea of using DAC to produce \u201cgreen\u201d gallons of petrol, rather than to offset emissions from processes where avoiding them is very much harder. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "You do not need to buy into Oxy\u2019s plans, though, to think that the best way to decarbonise some industrial plants will be through CCS, that hydrogen may be a good solution for some problems or that DAC has some sort of future role. Oil firms have the balance-sheets, project-management skills and engineering know-how needed to do that. Such businesses look like a better fit for them than renewable electricity (other than in offshore developments, perhaps, where Big Oil has relevant expertise).

Now, with global warming perilously close to 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level, the meaning is different\u2014and more urgent. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Demand is not set to wither organically in the face of better alternatives or as a response to high prices. Its putative decline will follow a policy-driven trajectory. But that trajectory is not set, and will not remain steady. In the face of such uncertainty it makes sense for some to try and get ahead and move on to other things while others double down, insisting that demand will last. Some will win, some will lose, and the spread of options may mean that supply shocks are minimised in a way that could not be guaranteed if everyone was getting out."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But there is a second concern. The end of the stone age did not mean that, after bronze-orientation day was over, stone was done. The world still uses a great deal of stone. Some in the oil industry seem to think that the same will apply to them; road transport may escape them, as electricity generation has, but with hard-to-displace products like jet fuel still needed and some DAC to clean up its products and image the industry will endure. Such die-hards will lobby ferociously for policies that slow the transition away from them, just as the boosters of renewables argue their opposite case. The difference is that those lobbying for survival will do so more ferociously than those who simply fancy a bit more growth.
