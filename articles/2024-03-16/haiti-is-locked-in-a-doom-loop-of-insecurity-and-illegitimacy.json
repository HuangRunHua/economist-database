On March 11th, under pressure from foreign government officials gathered at a summit in Jamaica, and with the gangs that control Port-au-Prince, the capital, blocking his return to Haiti, Mr Henry finally said he would stand aside. Stranded in Puerto Rico, he was reduced to delivering the message via a video posted on social media. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Haitians celebrated in the streets, but their country needs rebuilding. A combination of gang violence and the contested legitimacy, impotence and unpopularity of successive governments has dogged Haiti\u2019s 11.6m people for decades. The country has not a single elected official. Its legislature sits empty. Haiti has been in freefall since July 2021, when Jovenel Mo\u00efse, who was president at the time, was murdered. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Henry, who was appointed prime minister two days before the assassination, made things worse. He argued, with some good reason, that elections were not possible while Haiti was so insecure. But he also seemed keen to cling to power. His government\u2019s impotence left a vacuum to be filled by the gangs. Even before they blockaded Mr Henry\u2019s return, the UN reckoned they controlled 80% of the capital."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Henry\u2019s resignation is, in theory, the first step on the path to long-overdue elections. Leaders at the Jamaica summit proposed a \u201ctransitional presidential council\u201d of nine members drawn from political factions, the private sector, civil society and religious groups. That council would appoint an interim prime minister, who would rule while elections are organised."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet, as is common in Haiti, squabbling started within hours of the announcement. Multiple factions have made a claim to power. The \u201cNational Awakening for the Sovereignty of Haiti\u201d, a coalition, issued a statement saying that it was immediately installing a presidential council of three members in the National Palace. The coalition is led by Guy Philippe, a former senator who led an uprising in 2004 that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Mr Philippe returned to Haiti last year after serving time in an American prison for laundering drug money."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He is not the only one with ambition. Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, a Haitian warlord better known as \u201cBarbecue\u201d who leads a group of gangs called G9, warned that decisions made outside the country would plunge Haiti into \u201cfurther chaos\u201d. He said that his group would \u201cfigure out how to get Haiti out of the misery it\u2019s in now\u201d. Both men are disqualified from sitting on the Jamaican summit\u2019s version of the council: Mr Philippe for his criminal record and Mr Ch\u00e9rizier for being under UN sanctions. But refusing to give the gangs a seat at the table risks them overturning it. Politicians and political elites, who have long paid the gangs to do their bidding, may well use them to spoil an agreement they don\u2019t like. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This bodes ill for a transitional government, and for the UN-authorised security mission that is in the works. The Jamaican roadmap calls for the mission to go ahead. It bars anyone who opposes it from the transitional council. On March 11th the United States pledged an extra $100m to the cause, bringing its total donation to $300m. But troops are still in short supply. On March 12th Kenya, which has agreed to lead the mission, said that its deployment of 1,000 police officers cannot be sent until Haiti\u2019s new government is in place. It seems unlikely that the Haitian police can maintain security until that happens. They are outmanned and often outgunned by the gangs, despite the United States\u2019 assurances that it is supplying the police with equipment, resources and ammunition. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The United States says polls indicate that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of Haitians support the Kenya-led security mission. But it faces resistance, not least because it was initially requested by Mr Henry. He was largely seen to be doing so to prop up his rule. The last mission, run by the UN between 2004 and 2017, inadvertently introduced cholera and became notorious for reports of sexual exploitation and abuse against Haitians. Haiti will turn into \u201ca Somalia in the Caribbean\u201d if the force arrives, reckons Georges Duperval, a 58-year-old entrepreneur in Port-au-Prince, who opposes it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many Haitians say they want to throw off the shackles not only of foreign powers but of the elite Haitians who, they say, do their bidding. Unsavoury as he is, support for Mr Philippe is strong in Port-au-Prince and some areas around it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile Mr Ch\u00e9rizier seems in no mood to lay down arms. \u201cWe are making a bloody revolution in the country because this system is an apartheid system, a wicked system,\u201d he said this week. Many Haitians agree with this sentiment, says Mr Duperval. \u201cFrom 2004 to today, elections have been controlled by the Haitian oligarchs,\u201d he says. \u201cNow the Haitian people\u2019s eyes are open to this.\u201d\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sign up to El Bolet\u00edn, our subscriber-only newsletter on Latin America, to understand the forces shaping a fascinating and complex region."}], "id": 33}
