By the next day, after discovering that it had been edited, five photo agencies had pulled the picture from their wires. Princess Charlotte\u2019s hair, sleeve and skirt seemed to have been tinkered with. The Princess of Wales apologised for the changes, which she says she made herself, characterising them as the experiment of an amateur photographer. There is no suggestion that they were intended to deceive the public."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In an age when artificial intelligence (AI) tools can be used to distort or generate images, such changes are coming under more scrutiny than ever. In recent weeks pictures of Taylor Swift at an American-football game have been altered to suggest, falsely, that she was brandishing pro-Trump banners. Images fabricated by AI appeared to show the former president with black Americans, a group he is trying to court. Such falsehoods are clearly unacceptable.

Newspapers have for decades tweaked pictures to ensure that they look true to life when reproduced. Such changes take into account the variations of paper stock and ink or the demands of screens. Retouchers of black-and-white photographs used a fine brush and white paint to add, for example, highlights to eyes or contrast to the line of a trouser.

Overexposure, which washes out the subject, or an odd hue can be adjusted. That can sometimes lead to spurious criticism. In 2011 Hir TV, a Hungarian channel, accused The Economist of portraying Viktor Orban, the country\u2019s prime minister, unfavourably after we published a photograph of him cropped to fit the width of our print columns and edited to remove a yellow tint.

(They also require their clients to seek their permission and, in some cases, the permission of the subject before making serious changes to the picture.) Agencies do not run pictures that have been materially altered with image-editing software. They ban additions and deletions of subject matter, such as editing out a person. Cropping is allowed, so long as it does not remove important context. Most allow subtle lightening or darkening to improve the tonal balance of an image\u2014but anything that hides an element of the subject is forbidden. Simple colour adjustments, to create a natural image, are usually fine, but manipulating colours\u2014making a grey sky blue, for example\u2014is not. Some agencies edit photographs to remove \u201cred eye\u201d caused by flash photography; others do not."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Picture agencies supply various industries, all of which have different standards. Fashion magazines are filled with edited images. Pores are blurred, blemishes removed and bodies slimmed.

Given AI\u2019s increasing ability to create fake images, rigorous rules for genuine photographs are becoming all the more important. \u25a0"}], "id": 79}
