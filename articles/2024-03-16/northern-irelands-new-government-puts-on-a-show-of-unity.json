It is not the return of a power-sharing government that has people scratching their heads; it is how that government\u2019s leaders are behaving. Imagine Joe Biden and Donald Trump suddenly working together in harmony, and you have a sense of the strangeness. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government was restored in February, after a two-year hiatus following a walkout by the main unionist (pro-British) party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The DUP had objected to the customs and regulatory border established in the Irish Sea after Brexit, which ensured that the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland remained open. It returned to Stormont when the sea border was softened."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Devolved government has come and gone before. This time, however, the DUP returned to a very different political landscape. In elections held during the hiatus Sinn F\u00e9in, which wants a united Ireland, overtook the DUP for the first time, meaning its leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O\u2019Neill, is now first minister. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The DUP has thrown itself enthusiastically into the new arrangements. Emma Little-Pengelly, the deputy first minister (the roles have equal powers, but the title is symbolic) good-naturedly tried hurling, a Gaelic sport, in front of the TV cameras. Paul Givan, the education minister, spoke a few words of Irish at a school which teaches pupils in the language; seven years ago he contributed to a previous collapse of devolution by cutting a trifling amount of funding for an Irish-language bursary. Sinn F\u00e9in has been no less magnanimous. Last month Ms O\u2019Neill stood respectfully for a rendition of \u201cGod Save The King\u201d at a Northern Ireland football match. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Warm gestures are welcome but no guarantee of success. When Ian Paisley, a loyalist firebrand, and Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander, led a devolved administration in 2007, the former foes were known as \u201cthe chuckle brothers\u201d for their laughing and joking; less than ten months into office, Paisley was ousted by the party he had founded. Now, as then, the greatest vulnerability to the power-sharing government comes from within the DUP. Many of the party\u2019s most senior figures did not support a return to Stormont. One party member bemoans the DUP\u2019s \u201cglee\u201d at making symbolic compromises. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in also have very good reasons not to topple Stormont again. For the DUP, having no government has been bad for the union. Although a united Ireland is not imminent, more people in Northern Ireland are likely to see it as an alternative if devolution repeatedly fails. For Sinn F\u00e9in, an all-island party that has its eyes on the next general election in the republic, which is due to be held by March 2025, the priority is to show that it can be trusted in government. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even if both parties have an incentive to work together, the task ahead is hard. The province\u2019s roads are full of potholes; hospital waiting lists are the worst in the country; and teachers\u2019 pay badly lags behind that in England. Lough Neagh, source of over 40% of Northern Ireland\u2019s drinking water, is chronically polluted. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is little sign that the Stormont executive, which also has ministers from the Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionist Party, is ready to take hard decisions. The British government offered more than \u00a33bn ($3.8bn) if devolved government was restored, including a \u00a3559m debt write-off if the executive raised \u00a3113m of its own revenue. Northern Ireland\u2019s leaders, who boast that they have the lowest household taxes in Britain, are planning to raise only about \u00a330m while demanding billions more from London.
