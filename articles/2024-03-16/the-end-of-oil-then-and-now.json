Faced with much more expensive oil, utilities in America and elsewhere in the developed world took the substitution route and gave up on the fuel as a way of making electricity. In some places, such as France, Japan and Sweden, government-controlled utilities switched to nuclear power instead. In America the market-driven response was to switch to coal, in part because of ample supplies, in part because of the higher costs of nuclear energy.

When they came into force in 1978 they required an average fuel efficiency of 18 miles per gallon (13 litres per 100km) across carmakers\u2019 product lines; by 1985 that was up to 27.5mpg.

It is possible to use something more efficiently and also to increase the amount you are using.

Countries representing some 70% of the global economy, he said, introduced efficiency policies in 2022. And that year\u2019s rate of improvement turned out to be much higher than the historical average. Later in 2023 many of the nations attending COP28 in Dubai signed a renewables and energy-efficiency pledge which committed them to doubling the average rate of energy-efficiency improvements over the rest of the decade from the current 2% a year to over 4% a year.

Others reach different conclusions. Some see the potential of EVs as overblown. Yes, sales have been peppy, but their share of the fleet is still only 2% worldwide. What is more, cars last a long time these days. Ben Dell of Kimmeridge, an energy-investment firm, says that without policy interventions fleet turnover takes a couple of decades, with older petrol vehicles being sent to poorer countries rather than simply being scrapped.

A sustainable substitute for jet fuel seems unlikely, but the right incentives could see a fair bit of shipping move to methanol instead of bunker fuel.

Among his justifications are the forecasts he himself and others made at an IEA meeting in 1983. As ever the predictions ranged widely; yet in a number of cases the whole range ended up missing the mark. One of the all-too-high cases was oil demand in 2000; the experts had underappreciated the improvements in efficiency that were already under way. \u201cThe only small consolation that I can draw\u201d, Dr Smil says about that particular set of predictions, \u201cis that my\u2026forecast was less ridiculous than that of the World Bank\u2019s chief economist.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWe are quite good planning the supply but always wrong on demand\u201d\u2014Patrick Pouyann\u00e9"}, {"role": "body", "text": "And back then oil demand was still concentrated in a relatively small number of developed economies.

In all three of its scenarios the developing-world share of global demand, 55% in 2021, reaches 70% in 2050, and the factors influencing its oil-relevant policies vary greatly from economy to economy.
