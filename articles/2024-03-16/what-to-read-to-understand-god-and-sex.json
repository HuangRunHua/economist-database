Many Catholics are vexed because Pope Francis has modernised the church\u2019s attitude towards blessings for same-sex couples (though that word \u201cmodernised\u201d should be read with caution: the change appeared in a document bearing the title \u201cFiducia Supplicans\u201d, which itself clarified \u201cResponsum ad dubium\u201d). Many in the Anglican communion are similarly vexed thanks to the Archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s willingness to allow the Church of England to bless same-sex partnerships.

It is a good question\u2014and one that has baffled observers of Christianity for 2,000 years. Before He came along, European gods rarely cared about this stuff: the chief problem Greek and Roman deities had with sex was when they couldn\u2019t get enough of it. When Christianity turned up, classical intellectuals were baffled by its \u201crestless, shamelessly curious\u201d new deity, a \u201cnuisance\u201d, they felt, who watched \u201cman\u2019s every act\u201d\u2014and then judged it. Surely a god had better things to do? As the subsequent millennia showed, He did not. Here are six books that help explain why. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Poems. By Catullus.

Though equally you could choose the similarly sensuous poems of Sappho (the Greek poet from Lesbos, and the original lesbian); or Ovid\u2019s \u201cArt of Love\u201d; or Martial\u2019s \u201cEpigrams\u201d.

That is the question on modern minds when they consider ancient ideas of sexual renunciation. Why not just have sex? The Bible is one reason.

And, as Peter Brown points out in this sweeping book, there were good reasons for people in the ancient world to adopt this abstemious, censorious attitude: sex wasn\u2019t fun for everyone, and its consequences were certainly often less than fun for women. Contraception was all but absent. A gynaecologist\u2019s toolkit contained such devices as \u201cthe embryo-slaughterer\u201d (a detail Professor Brown\u2019s book does not mention.).
