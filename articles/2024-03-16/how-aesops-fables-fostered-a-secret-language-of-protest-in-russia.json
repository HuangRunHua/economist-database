One was spotted peering through roses in St Petersburg; another was illuminated by plastic torches next to a tributary of the Volga river. When Alexei Navalny, Russia\u2019s most prominent opposition leader, was alive, rubber ducks symbolised his fight against corruption. Since his death on February 16th, they have played a different role: to protest against the regime that murdered him, while evading censorship."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Aesop, a slave in Ancient Greece, is credited with invoking talking animals to tell tales about morality. In Russia, images of animals carry coded meaning. There is a herd of examples, such as stickers of a goose cawing. (The sound made by a goose is written as \u201cga-ga-ga\u201d, similar to \u201cHa-aga\u201d, the Russian pronunciation of The Hague, where Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, should be tried for war crimes in Ukraine.) Graffiti of a crossed-out fish is another allusion to Ukraine: net voine (no to war) in Russian has a similar number of letters to net voble (no to salt-cured fish)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cYou need to avoid your censor, and you know that censor is watching you all the time,\u201d explains Alexandra Arkhipova, a social anthropologist in Paris.
