The unemployment rate has been below 4% for 25 months in a row. Instead of ending 2023 in recession, as widely expected, it kept going\u2014and was nearly 3% bigger than at the end of 2022. Over five years, America\u2019s economy has grown twice as fast as the euro zone\u2019s and ten times as fast as Japan\u2019s.This performance reminded us of another cover we ran, almost a year ago. One option was to take the idea to its extreme. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In April 2023 our cowboy had been towering over the prairie. The new version had him above the clouds. That was fitting: America\u2019s economy has remained in the saddle despite sharp interest-rate rises, a trade war with China and real wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. However, unless you remembered last year\u2019s cover, the image was a bit baffling. Why was the horse up in the troposphere? What was it standing on? Why were its legs so long?We thought some more and came up with two other ideas."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One was based on the Stars and Stripes. We left the stars untouched, but converted the stripes into a bar chart. This was beautifully simple. But it suffered from a fundamental problem. Although the American economy is indeed miraculous, we had it doubling in size over the past decade. In reality, it has grown by about a quarter. We felt that was taking too much of a graphical liberty."}, {"role": "body", "text": "How about our second idea, a rippling bodybuilder? This image got nicely at a weakness in the growth story. One big reason the economy has expanded so fast is the pandemic stimulus, worth 26% of GDP, more than double the rich-world average. Yet that dose of steroids cannot be repeated\u2014America will this year spend more on debt interest than on defence. Indeed, protectionism and, under a future President Donald Trump, the mass deportation of illegal immigrants could yet threaten trade and the supply of labour and do real harm to the prospects for growth.The image divided our colleagues. Some worried that it would go viral in the wrong way, and that people would share it because of our bodybuilder\u2019s trunks rather than our own ideas. Perhaps we could jettison the jockstrap? How about a tastefully placed chart\u2014a sort of fiscal fig leaf?In the end we doubled down, with a white pair of briefs on a white background. This image is cheeky rather than offensive. A cover is supposed to grab the eye. It\u2019s a teaser, not a treatise.

But it should nonetheless be a wake-up call for the West. Far from collapsing, Russia\u2019s regime has proved resilient. Mr Putin\u2019s ambitions pose a long-term threat that goes far beyond Ukraine. Despite this, however, the West is still without a Russia strategy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Over the years our covers have featured a lot of bears. For one idea this week, gruesome, parallel gashes in a map were all we needed to depict the dangers ahead. The immediate worry is a defeat of Ukraine and, after that, attacks on neighbouring countries such as Moldova and the Baltic states; but that is not where Mr Putin\u2019s ambitions end. Russia may put nuclear warheads into space. Its drones and cyber-warriors allow it to project force beyond its borders. Its disinformation industry spreads lies and confusion. This malign combination has destabilised countries in the Sahel and propped up despots in Syria and central Africa. It could also sway some of the plethora of elections the world will see this year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Or, by playing with a cover line of \u201cInside Russia\u201d, we could focus on the violence Mr Putin is doing to his own people. Having taken over in 1999, he rolled back Russian democracy, especially after young, urban Russians staged mass protests in the 2010s. Textbooks and the media promote a seductive narrative of nationalism and Russian victimhood. Dissent at home has been strangled. The mutinous Yevgeny Prigozhin was blown from the sky and Mr Putin\u2019s most charismatic political rival, Alexei Navalny, was murdered in the gulag in February.Many in the West hoped that Western sanctions and Mr Putin\u2019s blunders in Ukraine might doom his regime. Yet as our study this week of life in Vladivostok shows, it looks solid. Russia\u2019s economy has been re-engineered. Oil exports bypass sanctions and are shipped to the global south. Western brands from BMW to H&amp;M have been replaced with Chinese and local substitutes. A prudent working assumption is that Mr Putin will be in power for years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "We believe that outward aggression and inward repression are part of the same impulse. Mr Putin blames the West for challenges to his rule, and seeks to safeguard his regime by shutting out Western influence and trying to unite the Russian people in a struggle against a caricature of America and NATO. At home and abroad, when words fail, he will use fear or violence. Those gloomy thoughts led us to this photograph of Red Square. You see it as if through a tunnel, drained of colour. St Basil\u2019s Cathedral looms over the cobblestones. A tense, silhouetted couple walk away from the camera holding hands\u2014not, it seems, out of love so much as for consolation."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240316_DE_EU.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1684.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Leader: The West urgently needs a strategy for dealing with RussiaEurope: Vladivostok is a window into wartime Russia"}], "id": 3}
