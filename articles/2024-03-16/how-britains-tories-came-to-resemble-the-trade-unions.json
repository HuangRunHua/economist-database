Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, and scores of Conservative MPs tucked into champagne and pork in the gothic splendour of the London Guildhall. There was much to celebrate. Founded by Margaret Thatcher and Keith Joseph in 1974 to \u201cthink the unthinkable\u201d about Britain\u2019s stalling post-war economy, its ideas and policies had powered her administration. The think-tank\u2019s principles remain the government\u2019s lodestars, Mr Sunak declared. \u201cIn no small part, we live in the world created by the Centre for Policy Studies.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "But triumphalism was mixed with gloom. It fell to Michael Spencer, chairman of the CPS, to share the bad news. Lately the Thatcherite revolution has not been going so well. Britain has struggled to produce growth that would have been the norm 20 years ago, he said. It is saddled with high debt and high taxes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government is in part a victim of external shocks in the form of covid-19 and the war in Ukraine. But much of the blame lies with Conservative backbenchers, whose approach to governing has come to resemble that of the trade unions whose strikes drove inflation, blackouts and shortages 50 years ago. Back then the CPS gave Thatcher her blueprint for breaking the shop stewards. Now the Tories themselves are the problem. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some Tory MPs see themselves less as part of a project of national government, more as delegates sent to negotiate with it. Their job is to extract benefits for their voters and to see off reforms that threaten them. Leaders of Tory factions issue dark threats of industrial action in the form of \u201cvote strikes\u201d or a calendar of sabotage they term the \u201cgrid of shit\u201d (a phrase of which Arthur Scargill, a miners\u2019 leader from the 1980s, would have been proud). In the 1970s trade-union leaders ambled up Downing Street to extract bumper pay deals over beer and sandwiches; today backbenchers arrive for breakfast rolls to exert pressure on behalf of their constituents and supporters. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those Tory supporters are disproportionately found among the old. That is a problem. Britain\u2019s most pressing challenge, says Robert Colvile, the CPS\u2019s current head, is demography. As the population ages, keeping spending on the over-65s at its current 10% share of gdp would require the economy as a whole to expand by nearly 3% a year. Yet much of the Tory party ducks this looming crunch, much as the unions of the 1970s refused to engage with post-war governments\u2019 trilemma of combining full employment, low inflation and high wage growth. Fifty years ago Joseph wanted to convince Tory MPs to take on the Labour-backing unions. Mr Colvile wants them to reckon with their core vote. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cOur role in society is to look after our members, not run the country,\u201d shrugged Joe Gormley, a miners\u2019 leader from the 1970s. The same attitude prevails among Tory MPs at budget time. The public finances are fragile: Jeremy Hunt\u2019s promise to reduce Britain\u2019s debt as a share of gdp in five years\u2019 time rests on heroic assumptions about spending restraint. Rather than confront that challenge, each year backbenchers present the Treasury with lists of tax cuts for their favoured groups (inheritors of large estates, pub landlords, motorists, dog-owners and so on) and pleas for \u201clevelling up\u201d cash for their areas. Their rhetoric is Thatcherite; their behaviour is clientelist. To his credit, at the budget on March 6th, Mr Hunt favoured tax cuts that will benefit workers and reward firms that invest. A smart party would have cheered them as proof they were grappling with intergenerational justice. Instead, some Tory MPs moaned that their older voters had been neglected."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Keeping a lid on taxation (due to hit 37.1% of GDP by 2029, the highest share since 1948, according to Britain\u2019s official fiscal watchdog) means tackling productivity. Yet when productivity-enhancing measures threaten the well-being of the core Tory electorate, MPs go on strike. The CPS wants sweeping liberalisation of Britain\u2019s planning rules; successive governments have caved to Tory backbenchers who have fought like picketing miners to restrict building. Britain\u2019s housing shortage is the Conservative equivalent of the \u201cclosed shop\u201d, which shielded unionised workers from pay competition. Insiders, who own homes, benefit from rising asset prices; outsiders pay the price. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Restraining spending would also mean reinventing the welfare state. Over 14 years in government, several schemes to fund adult social care\u2014among them duties on property, payroll taxes and insurance schemes\u2014have been proposed and then strangled. Like the carworkers\u2019 unions that fought off modernisation, a desire to see off short-term pain has prevailed over the long-run benefits of a reformed social-care system. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Which side are you on, boys?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1974 the unions appeared unstoppable. Yet they were sowing the seeds of their own demise. Many union leaders knew their pay demands were unsustainable but they spurned repeated pleas from sympathetic Tory and Labour governments to reform labour relations. The government became \u201ca gigantic Las Vegas slot machine that had suddenly got stuck in favour of the customer\u201d, said Tom Jackson, a postmen\u2019s leader at the time. As the number of losers from inflation grew, Thatcher could reap the electoral rewards of taking on the \u201cenemy within\u201d. The unions failed to compromise when they had the upper hand, and paid the price."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Therein lies the lesson for Tory trade unionists. Demography and sluggish growth are straining the post-cold-war model of low-ish taxes and a generous welfare state. But when their electorate faces hard choices, Tory backbenchers protect their voters\u2019 short-term interests. In failing to forge new settlements on taxation, public services and Britain\u2019s ability to get things built while they have enjoyed influence, the Tory militants are set to hand the initiative to a future Labour government. They have left it to their opponents to think the unthinkable. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Bagehot, our columnist on British politics: What the softening of the Sun says about Britain (Mar 6th)Speaker Hoyle and the strange politics of human resources (Feb 26th)Sir Keir Starmer: bureaucrat first, politician second (Feb 21st)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Bagehot column got its name"}], "id": 45}
