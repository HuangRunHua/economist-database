The ring was later revealed to be Chinese. The politician remains unnamed. The claim triggered fierce speculation, and a debate about whether Mr Burgess was stoking paranoia. Australian intelligence agencies \u201cwill do anything to destabilise any meaningful rapprochement\u201d with China, said Paul Keating, a former Labor prime minister, on March 5th."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Burgess rarely pulls his punches. He has warned of similar threats in speeches for his Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) since 2020. He often flags foreign meddling. Last year at the first public meeting of the Five Eyes, an intelligence-sharing group of America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand, he said that \u201cthe Chinese government is engaged in the most sustained...and sophisticated theft of intellectual property and expertise in human history.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Declassifying the information last month served two main goals, according to Mr Burgess. The first was to educate Australians about the growing threat of both espionage and foreign interference (which involves a foreign government secretly influencing people and politics). The second was to send a message to China: \u201cWe want the A-team\u2019s bosses to know its cover is blown,\u201d he said. Underlying that may be a concern about complacency over China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since Australians elected a Labor government, led by Anthony Albanese, in 2022 the bilateral relationship has improved. Mr Albanese\u2019s government has not made major concessions to China and backs AUKUS, a submarine-building pact with America and Britain. However, it avoids calling out China publicly. As a result, China has lifted most of the trade restrictions it imposed on Australia in 2020, and may lift tariffs on wine shortly (see China section). Exports have boomed from A$147bn ($97bn) in 2020 to over $200bn in 2023. Most strategists agree that this is good news. But the \u201cgap between what the government says and what it knows is big and getting bigger,\u201d says Rory Medcalf at the Australian National University in Canberra. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some intelligence officials worry that Australians may miss the nuance, and that a \u201cstabilised\u201d relationship might be taken as a sign that the Chinese threat is abating. The share of Australians who say China is \u201cmore of a security threat than an economic partner\u201d fell from 63% in 2022 to 52% last year, according to polling from the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the other side, the government is under fire from a small but vocal group of former Labor politicians. They are critical of what Mr Keating calls Australia\u2019s \u201cmindless pro-American stance\u201d and accuse intelligence heads of tub-thumping over China. Successive governments have given \u201cfree rein in security policymaking to hardliners in the defence and intelligence community\u201d, wrote Gareth Evans, a former Labor foreign minister, in December."}, {"role": "body", "text": "However, according to John Blaxland, the author of an official history of ASIO, \u201cthe threat of foreign interference is real.\u201d China has long courted influence with Australian politicians. ASIO now says that the \u201cA-team\u201d is grooming well-connected Australians online, with offers of \u201cconsulting\u201d jobs. An unnamed \u201cnation-state\u201d is using \u201ctop-notch tradecraft\u201d to probe critical infrastructure networks for weakness, according to Mr Burgess. Meanwhile, his job will only become harder. Australia\u2019s role in the Indo-Pacific power contest makes it a target. Under AUKUS, America will be sharing prized nuclear-propulsion technology with it. Foreign agents are already probing for information. \u25a0"}], "id": 16}
