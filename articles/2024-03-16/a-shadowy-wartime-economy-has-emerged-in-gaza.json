Having fled to Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah, she messaged a friend still in the north to check on the family home, only to be told that looters had got through a hole in a broken wall and stolen everything."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Numerous displaced Palestinians say their homes in the north have been ransacked while they sought shelter in Gaza\u2019s south. Everything from televisions and kitchen appliances to furniture has been taken by Palestinian gangs, which aid workers say have been increasingly well organised in the north, even as Israel\u2019s army claims to be in full control of the area."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of the loot is then offered for sale in makeshift markets, where the victims of robbery have sometimes been able to buy back their own stolen goods, including furniture. These flea markets are part of an emerging patchwork economy where clans, local mafias and established businessmen can use their know-how and muscle, in some cases abetted by links to Israel and Egypt, to fill a vacuum."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gaza\u2019s clans have long been power-brokers. They never went away under Hamas, whose cannier leaders learned not to pick quarrels with the larger families, preferring to operate in tandem or alongside them rather than in opposition. Aid officials and observers say the clans are involved in both types of crookery: in some cases they offer NGOs safe warehouses and merchants protection for their goods\u2014for a fee; in others they arrange the theft of aid, which they later sell at extortionate prices."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In January reports that Israel\u2019s security chiefs favoured the idea of using Gaza\u2019s clans to help temporarily administer the strip drew widespread international criticism. Yet it is already beginning to happen. NGOs are indirectly employing the services of southern Gaza\u2019s biggest families to protect and help distribute aid to the lawless territory\u2019s desperate people. Videos circulating on social media depict men armed with sticks, sometimes with guns, riding on top of humanitarian convoys. Israel has cited this as evidence of Hamas stealing aid. But aid workers say in many cases members of powerful families have been hired to protect goods from desperate crowds that might ransack the lorries."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240316_MAM961.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 700.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The rise of these families is \u201ca recipe for internal strife\u201d, says Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of politics at Gaza\u2019s al-Azhar University (now destroyed) who has fled to Cairo. \u201cThese big clans will try to monopolise and dictate the lives of other Palestinian families,\u201d he warns, noting that some more established families were involved in extrajudicial killings during past periods of turmoil. One of them, the Dughmush, was involved in the kidnapping of a BBC journalist, Alan Johnston, in 2007.

The Palestinian Monetary Authority, based in Ramallah in the West Bank, is the closest thing the Palestinians have to a central bank.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "America\u2019s plans for a floating pier off Gaza\u2019s coast may well allow more supplies into the strip, but NGOs and the UN repeatedly say that aid alone cannot stave off a famine. To tackle the crisis, private Gazan businesspeople must be given their head. Yet commercial imports remain minuscule. Private business in Gaza has virtually collapsed since October 7th.

But this can have disastrous consequences, as in February when 112 people were killed trying to get to aid in lorries brought in by Palestinian merchants. And traders uncertified by the Israelis have to co-operate with the clans or families to do the same. Corruption is inevitably rife. \u201cYou are allowing these six or seven individuals to control the economy,\u201d says a former official of the Palestinian Authority. \u201cWhat is developing is warlordism\u2014and it\u2019s Israel who decides.\u201d \u25a0"}], "id": 29}
