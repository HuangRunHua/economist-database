The propaganda churned out by the Communist Party isn\u2019t very subtle\u2014or accurate (China does not hold many elections and it tacitly backs Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine). But when directed at foreigners, China\u2019s messaging is surprisingly effective, suggests a new study by political scientists at Harvard, Yale and the University of Groningen (in the Netherlands).

The first was shown Chinese propaganda, the second was shown messaging from the American government, the third got a bit of both and the fourth was a placebo group. Before and after watching, participants were asked about the economic and political models of America and China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Support for the China model increased substantially among those who watched Chinese state media. By the end of the study, a majority of people who viewed such messages said they preferred China\u2019s form of government to America\u2019s. The American propaganda had an impact, too, but less of one. In the group that watched videos from both countries, people moved towards China."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Chinese videos do not seem to have convinced people that the country is democratic. But they strengthened perceptions that the Communist Party delivers growth, stability and competent leadership. In \u201can era of democratic backsliding\u201d, audiences put considerable weight on these factors when assessing political systems, say the researchers. The study was carried out before a recent wave of covid-19 killed hundreds of thousands of people in China.
