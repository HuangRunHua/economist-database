Individual acts of defiance are unusual in the age of Z (the symbol of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the nationalist mindset that goes with it). A collective endeavour such as this appears to trigger extreme emotions. The play being performed is a comic take on a biblical classic, but the contemporary allusions are not hard to fathom.

Audience members who have been following social media know that the real-life inspiration for Little Sergei, Serhii Podlianov from Zaporizhia, was far less fortunate. He was killed in November by a Russian missile, aged just two days old.

Even as Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cspecial operation\u201d struggles to make progress in Ukraine, the fear and conformity it has instilled at home mean that domestically, at least, it is yielding real results. Since February 24th last year, when the current invasion began, authorities have used the crisis to try to yank Russian life from a Western trajectory, meddling in personal space, culture and even schools in a way not seen since the Soviet Union."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the arts, the result has been a toxic mix of repression and preventive self-censorship. Together with a mass exodus of creative talent, this is arguably the biggest disruption to the course of Russian culture since Stalin\u2019s \u201ccultural revolution\u201d saw off the avant-garde in the benighted 1930s. In a telling indication of autocracy\u2019s limits, however, a push to foment an alternative pro-war culture has been markedly less successful."}, {"role": "body", "imageURL": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_LJV5nOSjCE", "imageWidth": "640", "imageHeight": "360", "imageDescription": "", "text": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Berkovich says she is under little illusion about the reach and effects of her own work, which she describes as a \u201cmodest personal survival mechanism\u201d.

In the context of Z-Russia, writing a play that \u201cemphasises the miracle of life\u201d was equivalent to no more than a \u201cmosquito dance\u201d.
