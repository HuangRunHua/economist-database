As a giant excavator swallowed its way closer, hundreds of police, unfazed by the pyrotechnics propelled at them, dragged protesters from their stations.

Many governments are encouraging consumption of these dirty fuels by subsidising energy use, to help citizens get through the winter.

Indeed, even as Mr Habeck endorsed coal-mining last year, the Green politician set out plans to expand solar and wind energy, including in Lutzerath\u2019s gusty Rhineland.

To assess the overall picture, The Economist has looked at a range of factors, including fossil-fuel consumption, energy efficiency and renewables deployment.

Before the war, it seemed as if appetite for the fuel, having peaked in 2013, was in secular decline. Last year, however, consumption grew by 1.2%, surpassing 8bn tonnes for the first time in history. Sky-high gas prices have pushed utility firms in Europe and parts of Asia, notably Japan and South Korea, to use much more of the stuff. Politicians have prolonged the life of coal-fired plants, reopened closed ones and lifted production caps. This has led to a scramble for supply\u2014one which has been exacerbated by Europe\u2019s ban on Russian imports. In China and India production jumped by 8% and 11% respectively in 2022, pushing world output to a record high.

Europe will receive less gas from Russia, and global lng supply is likely to stay tight, meaning coal will remain the bloc\u2019s fallback option. India\u2019s appetite will probably grow, adding to demand. But the rise will be tempered by an increase in the use of renewables\u2014and beyond 2025 coal\u2019s fortunes look dim. New lng projects in America, Qatar and elsewhere will kick in, providing relief to gas markets.

Russia cannot easily redirect gas exports; its oil rigs, lacking people and parts, may soon produce less than they do now. Although energy-hungry countries have been busy signing long-term deals to import lng, which will force them to import the fossil fuel for several more decades, volumes remain modest. Hydrocarbon firms are enjoying juicy profits, but investment in new projects is falling. Such investment remains well below levels of a decade ago, and a dollar seems to go less far nowadays: capital expenditure per barrel of output, a measure of exploration and production costs, has risen by 30% since 2017. Sustained demand amid slowly rising, perhaps even falling, supply should keep prices of both oil and gas high.

Last year the world economy became 2% less energy-intensive\u2014measured by the amount of energy it uses to produce one unit of gdp\u2014its fastest rate of improvement in a decade. Efforts to consume less are most apparent in Europe, which in recent months has been assisted by unusually mild temperatures. According to McKinsey, a consultancy, warm weather and greater energy efficiency mean the continent has used 6-8% less electricity this winter than in the previous one. And all over the world, capital is being mobilised on a vast scale to make the economy more frugal. Last year governments, households and firms together spent $560bn on energy efficiency. This money mainly went on two technologies: electric vehicles and heat pumps. Sales of the former almost doubled in both 2021 and 2022.

At \u20ac257 per megawatt-hour (mwh), the average price in Germany in December, a typical solar plant takes less than three years to become profitable, against 11 years at \u20ac50 per mwh, the average spot price between 2000 and 2022. Globally, installations of rooftop solar panels, which households and firms use to trim bills, rose by half last year. A record 128gw of onshore-wind projects also broke ground, marking a 35% increase from the year before."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such indicators only cover a fraction of the activity that has taken place since the war, because selecting a site, obtaining permits and designing large wind or solar farms can take many years. A more representative\u2014and even more encouraging\u2014metric is the amount of money flowing to new projects. Last year global capital expenditure on wind and solar assets grew from $357bn to $490bn, surpassing investment in new and existing oil and gas wells for the first time. Rystad Energy, a consultancy, reckons that investment will continue to rise over the next two years. The iea expects China to build renewable-generation capacity capable of supplying 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2025, equivalent to the total power generation of Japan today. More money is also being earmarked for nascent technologies, such as green hydrogen, which could help decarbonise activities that are hard to electrify. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the same time, the fuel squeeze has turbocharged clean-energy policy in the world\u2019s biggest economies. America\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (ira) earmarks $369bn of subsidies for green tech; the European Commission plans to provide at least \u20ac250bn ($270bn) to clean-tech companies, and has decided to bring forward the target for doubling the eu\u2019s installed solar capacity to 2025, from 2030. National ambitions have been supersized, too. In July Germany raised its target for the renewable share in power generation by 2030 to 80%, from 65%. China\u2019s 14th five-year plan for energy, released in June, for the first time sets a goal for the share of renewables in power generation (of 33% by 2025). The country\u2019s provincial governments are also increasingly offering green incentives. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of the money will be spent inefficiently.

This industrial policy will compound an existing problem: that of cost inflation. Russia\u2019s war lifted the price of metals such as aluminium, copper and steel, all of which are crucial for cables, turbines and panels. Although some commodity prices are now falling, costs are instead being pushed up by higher interest rates\u2014a particular issue for developers of solar and wind farms, which require more capital upfront than regular power plants. High freight and power costs, as well as staffing shortages, add to the bill. Namit Sharma of McKinsey reckons that by 2030 the eu will have to quadruple the number of people developing, building and running green plants in order to meet its targets.

Several offshore-wind giants have recently announced that they will carry out huge write-downs on projects. In theory, developers could pass higher costs on to consumers by bidding for potential projects at higher prices. But in practice miserly new national rules and auction designs make doing so difficult. This winter the eu adopted a windfall tax on renewable-energy generators, and a cap on wholesale power prices, in effect placing a ceiling on returns. Germany\u2019s new offshore-wind-tender system makes bidders compete over how much they are willing to pay to run projects, a system known as \u201cnegative bidding\u201d. Never-ending permitting wrangles dilute returns even further.

But even in this fallen world, they are still momentous\u2014sufficient, forecasters consulted by The Economist estimate, to help accelerate the energy transition by five to ten years. The investment surge and tighter targets should create a huge amount of renewable-generation capacity. All told, the iea expects global renewable-energy capacity to rise by 2,400gw between 2022 and 2027, an amount equivalent to China\u2019s entire installed power capacity today. That is almost 30% higher than the agency\u2019s forecast in 2021, released before the war. Renewables are set to account for 90% of the increase in global generation capacity over the period.

This is because the rush for fossil fuels is unlikely to last long or be large enough to counteract the renewables boom.
