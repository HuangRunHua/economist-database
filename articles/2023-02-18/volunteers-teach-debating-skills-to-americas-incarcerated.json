That\u2019s the actual way it is,\u201d said Domenick Crispino, bluff and jovial as he spoke from behind a lectern. He knows whereof he speaks. After the word \u201csomething\u201d he smiled sheepishly and raised his hand: Mr Crispino, a former lawyer, spent six years behind bars."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Crispino was arguing to retain cash bail, which he said helps deter crime and provides an essential incentive to get people to return to court. Whether he actually believed this is beside the point: he was involved in a debating contest on the topic of cash bail, along with another ex-inmate, against two Columbia University students, and a coin-toss determined the position he took."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Crispino works with the Rikers Debate Project (RDP), a group of volunteers who have taught around 1,000 prisoners debating skills over the past seven years. The RPD arranges debates between inmates and former inmates who have taken their classes, and students; it pays ex-inmates $250 per debate. RDP began at Rikers Island, New York City\u2019s biggest jail, but has expanded to other facilities in New York and beyond. At its pre-pandemic peak the project was teaching 12 classes in six states, including Louisiana and Texas.
