Both are married, but there is a charge to their long, wine-soaked, moonlit chats whenever one visits the other, either in Los Angeles or New York. For reasons both self-serving and ostensibly feminist, Tessa takes a dim view of Charlie\u2019s wife, Wah, who is somehow too sincere, too feminine, too subservient and wears \u201ctoo floral\u201d dresses. \u201cI had the impression\u2026that I could crush her if I so much as reached out too quickly,\u201d Tessa observes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right for a woman to be so fragile.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cMy Nemesis\u201d, Charmaine Craig\u2019s taut, bristling and psychologically profound third novel, is the story of a seductive friendship that threatens to upend two homes. But it is really about the unwieldy needs and desires of middle age, \u201cwith death looming on one side, disappointment on the other, and nothing but a Sisyphean wheel of activities supporting the structure of one\u2019s present\u201d. It is also about the selfish demands of creativity, \u201cthe shocks and shames of parenthood\u201d, the sacrifices made by women and how love can arise from an error of perception."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Tessa is a fascinating solipsist who misunderstands herself, a feminist who holds other women in contempt, and an intellectual aggressor who likes to leave opponents bloodied. \u201cThere are times when I can\u2019t distinguish my habit of honesty from brutality,\u201d she concedes. Through Charlie, she experiences the invigoration of desire, which can seem unbearably enticing when life feels short and the days all somehow run together."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All this is a departure for Ms Craig. Her previous novels were lavishly detailed historical epics; \u201cMiss Burma\u201d (published in 2017) was longlisted for the National Book Award and the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction. Slimmer, punchier and more tightly wound, \u201cMy Nemesis\u201d highlights her talent for capturing the minutiae of interpersonal drama. She dilates each moment, noticing, for example, the way Tessa\u2019s adult daughter\u2019s shoulders stiffen \u201cunder the reproachful tension of her delicate neck\u201d during a fraught lunch with her mother."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Associating femininity with weakness, Tessa is repulsed by Charlie\u2019s wistful description of Wah as \u201csoft, feminine\u201d. Yet she senses that there is something cruel and petulant about her own efforts to curdle Charlie\u2019s perception of his wife. She recalls a time as a child when a neighbourhood friend asked for help stoning a crow. \u201cIt fluttered in a harrowing circle on the ground, calling to us, to anyone, for help,\u201d Tessa remembers. Yet \u201cthe more helpless that crow had become, the worthier of death it had appeared to be.\u201d\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 70}
