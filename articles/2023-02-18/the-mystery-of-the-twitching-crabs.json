Locals such as Mr Rennie, who has fished there since he was 13, call it \u201cthe die-off\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The north-east coast is one of Britain\u2019s main fishing grounds, particularly for shellfish, which are mostly caught close to shore. Several of the ports along a 70-km stretch around the mouth of the River Tees have seen much of this catch vanish.

The first theory tentatively suggested by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was \u201calgal bloom\u201d\u2014when vast clusters of phytoplankton starve sea life of oxygen. But blooms tend to be seasonal, so could not explain why smaller wash-ups continued throughout 2022 nor why many crabs were found twitching. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Local fishermen paid for their own study, which produced a second theory: that crabs were being poisoned by chemicals like pyridine, which had been stored in sediment following decades of industrial activity on the Tees and then released by dredging. Labour MPs and councillors accused Ben Houchen, the pugnacious Tory mayor of Teesside, of recklessly expanding the local freeport. Mr Houchen said they were using fishermen as \u201cpawns\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last month Defra published a new report from its \u201ccrustacean mortality expert panel\u201d, a group of scientists and industry experts. It concluded that both algal bloom and pyridine were \u201cunlikely\u201d and \u201cvery unlikely\u201d causes of the die-off, respectively; it found no evidence of a link to dredging, either. Instead it pointed the finger at a third culprit, a novel pathogen. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most experts see the panel as credible; Mr Houchen told his critics to \u201cfollow the science\u201d. Dredging restarted this month to create a new quay for the freeport. Yet the mystery is not yet solved. No new pathogen has yet been identified. The Defra study says only that the new theory was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d. It also notes that several factors may have combined to \u201cdegrade the marine environment\u201d. \u201cJust like with covid-19, we know that marine pathogens are likely to arise in the most degraded places\u2014and that means ex-industrial areas like Teesside,\u201d says John Bothwell, a marine biologist at Durham University. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "If a new disease has emerged, allowing it to spread could be risky. The Defra panel points to the example of Long Island Sound, an estuary near New York, where 11m lobsters died in 1999. Lobstermen there similarly saw pollution as the cause; scientists later found a parasite was responsible. The lobster industry has never recovered. The British government could take steps to improve monitoring and remove infected crabs, some experts say. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Urgency is lacking, however. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the environment secretary, has said no further analysis will be done by government agencies. Academics are seeking funding for more research, but that takes time.
