Any wisdom in the stacks is dwarfed by endless volumes of gibberish. With no locatable index, every search for knowledge is futile. Librarians are on the verge of suicide."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Borges\u2019s nightmarish repository is a cautionary tale for the Supreme Court next week, as it takes up two cases involving a fiercely contested provision of a nearly 30-year-old law regulating web communications. If the justices use Gonzalez v Google and Taamneh v Twitter to crack down on the algorithms online platforms use to curate content, Americans may soon find it much harder to navigate the 2.5 quintillion bytes of data added to the internet each day."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, has been interpreted by federal courts to do two things. First, it immunises both \u201cprovider[s]\u201d and \u201cuser[s]\u201d of \u201can interactive computer service\u201d from liability for potentially harmful posts created by other people. Second, it allows platforms to take down posts that are \u201cobscene\u2026excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable\u201d\u2014even if they are constitutionally protected\u2014without risking liability for any such content they happen to leave up. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Disgruntlement with Section 230 is bipartisan. Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden have called for its repeal (though Mr Biden now says he prefers to reform it). Scepticism on the right has focused on licence the law affords technology companies to censor conservative speech. Disquiet on the left stems from a perception that the law permits websites to spread misinformation and vitriol that can fuel events like the insurrection of January 6th 2021."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Tragedy underlies both Gonzalez and Taamneh. In 2015 Nohemi Gonzalez, an American woman, was murdered in an Islamic State (IS) attack in Paris. Her family says the algorithms on YouTube (which is owned by Google) fed radicalising videos to the terrorists who killed her. The Taamneh plaintiffs are relatives of Nawras Alassaf, a Jordanian killed in Istanbul in 2017. They contend that Section 230 should not hide the role Twitter, Facebook and Google played in grooming the IS perpetrator. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Biden administration is taking a nuanced stand against the tech giants. In its brief to the justices, the Department of Justice says Section 230 protects \u201cthe dissemination of videos\u201d on YouTube by users\u2014including terrorist training videos by the likes of IS. But the platform\u2019s \u201crecommendation message[s]\u201d are another story, the department says. These nudges, auto-loaded videos in a user\u2019s \u201cUp next\u201d sidebar, arise from \u201cYouTube\u2019s own platform-design choices\u201d and should not be protected under the umbrella of Section 230.

The Anti-Defamation League, a civil-rights group, writes that the companies\u2019 strategy of keeping us \u201cscrolling and clicking\u201d through targeted algorithms threatens \u201cvulnerable communities most at risk of online harassment and related offline violence\u201d. Ted Cruz, a senator, along with 16 fellow Republican lawmakers, decries the \u201cnear-absolute immunity\u201d that lower courts\u2019 decisions have conferred \u201con Big Tech companies to alter and push harmful content\u201d under Section 230. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But nearly 50 amicus briefs opposing a rejigging of Section 230 warn of unintended consequences. An internet resembling Borges\u2019s useless library is one worry. Meta, which owns Facebook, notes that \u201cvirtually every online service\u201d (from weather to cooking to sports) highlights content that is \u201crelevant\u201d to particular users. The algorithms matching posts with users are \u201cindispensable\u201d, the company says, to sift through \u201cthousands or millions\u201d of articles, photos or reviews. Yelp adds that holding companies liable for restaurant reviews posted by users would \u201ctrigger an onslaught of suits\u201d.

There is, they say, no \u201cboundless immunity\u2026for harmful third-party content\u201d. But Mike Masnick, founder of Techdirt, a blog, thinks such a reconceptualisation of the law would invite \u201chavoc\u201d. The crux of Section 230, he says, is pinning responsibility for harmful speech on the \u201cproper party\u201d: the person who made the content, not the \u201ctool\u201d he uses to communicate it. If that distinction disappears, Mr Masnick cautions, vexatious lawsuits would blossom whenever \u201csomeone somewhere did something bad with a tool\u201d.

When platforms \u201calert specific users\u201d of videos or articles, Mr Wheeler says, \u201cconduct becomes content\u201d and should no longer receive Section 230 protection. Some advocates of curbed immunity distinguish between benign and destructive algorithms. \u201cSomebody has to draw a line,\u201d Mr Wheeler says.
