Thousands of buildings have collapsed. At least 36,000 people are dead in Turkey. Another 6,000 were killed in Syria. More than 30,000 rescue workers, accompanied by locals and teams from dozens of countries, are working around the clock to find survivors.

In Kahramanmaras, a city of more than 500,000, smoke from fires that broke out as a result of the quake (or were started by people trying to keep warm) envelops mounds of rubble that stretch for entire city blocks.

The government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s president, bears much of the blame, analysts say.

Building permits are easy to acquire, and inspections weak. The companies that are mandated to carry them out are paid by the developers. Projects usually comply with government standards at the start of construction, but not by the end, says Mr Guvenc. When the inspectors leave, developers may reduce the amount of iron they use or cut down on the number of stirrups, the steel loops that prevent beams and columns from buckling under pressure. They may even tack on an extra floor. Then they enter informal negotiations with local authorities. \u201cA lot of money may end up changing hands,\u201d says Mr Guvenc. \u201cWe are talking about corruption par excellence.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This means the difference between life and death. In Osmaniye, as elsewhere, most of the collapsed buildings date back to before the 1999 earthquake. But scores of new ones have also come down.

The contractor responsible was arrested on February 11th while attempting to leave Turkey. In nearby Erzin county, however, not one building collapsed.

Mr Erdogan\u2019s government passed several such amnesties, the latest in 2018, ahead of general elections. The opposition backed the move, because it was popular with voters. The government reaped the political dividends, while millions of property owners ended up paying into state coffers and assuming the risk. A year later, Mr Erdogan appeared in Kahramanmaras, proudly announcing that the programme \u201chad solved the problems\u201d of 144,000 of the city\u2019s residents.
