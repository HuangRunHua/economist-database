No one is visibly having any fun anywhere. The northern seaside town of Skegness has long been famous for offering pleasures that are at best muted\u2014as even it acknowledges. Its famous slogan, coined in its Edwardian heyday, reads less like a boast than a confession, or perhaps a threat: \u201cSkegness is SO bracing.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Skegness is also so cross. Around 200-230 asylum-seekers, many from Iran, Iraq and Eritrea, are being housed by the Home Office in five of the town\u2019s guesthouses. This is not unusual: 45,000 asylum-seekers have been housed over the winter in a variety of British hotels, from the Suites Hotel &amp; Spa in Knowsley, Merseyside (\u201cthe only 4-star hotel in the North West where everyone gets a Suite!\u201d) to a Hilton in the wilds of north Wales (\u201cA stylish stay in beautiful Snowdonia\u201d).

On February 10th far-right protesters gathered outside that hotel in Knowsley; a police van was set alight in the ensuing disorder.

Skegness is \u201calways the butt of everyone\u2019s jokes\u201d, says Ian Gardner, who runs the Balmoral guesthouse in the town.

The Home Office has put some asylum-seekers in places such as Snowdonia, Merseyside and Skegness (which has received more since a refugee-processing centre in Kent closed at the end of 2022), but many other areas house far more. \u201cSome constituencies literally have thousands,\u201d says Matt Warman, Skegness\u2019s Conservative MP. Yet because the total number of hotels in the town is small, says Mr Warman, the effect of those few migrants on the public mood is \u201cdisproportionate\u201d.

Asylum hotels are often closer to prisons with pebbledash. Front doors are shut and locked; net curtains are drawn; a \u201cNO VACANCY\u201d sign flashes in one window. Ring the bell and you will find the door answered not by an eager bellhop but by a security guard in black; he is very unlikely to invite you in for canap\u00e9s.

In Merseyside a far-right group is reported to have distributed leaflets lamenting \u201c5-star hotels for migrants whilst Brits freeze\u201d. In Skegness one elderly lady recalls with satisfaction that she recently steered her shopping trolley into some asylum-seekers who were standing in her way and had not moved upon request. She thinks Britain should \u201csend them all home\u201d.
