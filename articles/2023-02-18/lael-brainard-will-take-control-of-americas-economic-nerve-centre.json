But the director of the National Economic Council\u2019s (nec\u2019s) office, in the White House west wing, is a crucial place. Its occupant for the past two years, Brian Deese, has crafted the administration\u2019s response to the covid-19 slowdown, inflation and China. In the coming days Lael Brainard, a board member at the Federal Reserve since 2014, will take over the poky but powerful office."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Amid Washington\u2019s formidable political machinery, at first glance the institution of the nec also seems puny. It is young\u2014founded a mere three decades ago\u2014and has only 30 staff. But it is the clearing-house for White House economic debates, helping the president set strategy. It then co-ordinates departments in the implementation of policy. With power concentrated in Joe Biden\u2019s White House, the nec has gained clout compared with cabinet agencies, notably the Treasury."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Deese steps down at a natural time for a reshuffle, following midterm elections. He had a productive run. Congress passed four big pieces of economic legislation, adding up to trillions of dollars of spending: a covid-recovery package, plus hefty investment in infrastructure, semiconductors and clean technologies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Legislative success stems from officials working together. But Mr Deese was consistently at the centre of things. \u201cHe had a commanding understanding of every issue,\u201d reports Jason Furman, deputy director of the council under Barack Obama. Mr Deese worked with Republicans to secure the passage of the infrastructure bill and with Joe Manchin, an obstreperous Democratic senator, to enact the climate law. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet this legislative success did not always produce real-world success. The pandemic package contributed to inflationary pressure, which America is still struggling to rein in; the administration\u2019s industrial policy has annoyed allies, who see it as protectionism. The task falls to Ms Brainard, an experienced policymaker, to see through the wide-ranging plans and to remedy missteps. \u201cShe has the skills to roll up her sleeves and get that done,\u201d says Wendy Edelberg of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank. There is scant prospect of anything more ambitious in the next two years, since Congress is divided. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her experience may help President Biden mollify allies concerned by his subsidies. As America\u2019s top financial diplomat under President Obama, Ms Brainard worked well with other countries, a quality that will again be in demand. At the same time, she will also have a role in ensuring that America dodges calamity and raises the debt ceiling. With a background as both a central banker and a Treasury official, Ms Brainard is well placed to navigate the budgetary shoals. She will still need all the heft the nec can offer to get her way. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 61}
