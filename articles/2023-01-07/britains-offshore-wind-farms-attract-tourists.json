Then came Rampion, a 400MW offshore wind farm now operated by RWE, a utility firm. Its construction limited opportunities for diving trips. So Mr Dyer bought the domain name \u201cwww.rampionwindfarm.co.uk\u201d and began offering boat trips for tourists to see the wind farm up close. Four years later business is booming. \u201cIt just gets busier and busier,\u201d he says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rampion faced opposition because locals said it would spoil the view of the English Channel from the South Downs National Park, part of which overlooks Brighton. Yet where some see ugliness, others see beauty. At least five companies are now offering boat trips. \u201cThere\u2019s enough to go around,\u201d says Steve Johnson, another tour operator.

Employees of oil firms have been booking trips. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got departments that work in renewables,\u201d says one sailor. \u201cBut they\u2019ve never seen a wind farm.\u201d Others come from farther afield. \u201cWe get a lot of engineering types,\u201d boasts another. \u201cSo a lot of Chinese.\u201d With the air of a taxi driver proud of having a TV star in the back of their cab, one mariner brags that he recently had a certain East Asian ambassador on his boat, who wants to build offshore wind farms back home. Sailors are adept at talking about wind-farm technology. \u201cI just sit there and give them 45 minutes of spiel,\u201d says one. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Dyer claims that his trips have helped to assuage the concerns of locals who campaigned against the wind farm being built. But trouble is brewing again. RWE is planning a big expansion of Rampion, adding 90, much taller turbines to the existing 116. Campaigners argue that this would harm wildlife and habitats. \u201cTourists like a boat trip,\u201d says Zoe Visram of the Middleton-On-Sea Coastal Alliance. \u201cHowever, that does not warrant building a gigantic wind farm close to shore.\u201d Many a skipper might disagree.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
