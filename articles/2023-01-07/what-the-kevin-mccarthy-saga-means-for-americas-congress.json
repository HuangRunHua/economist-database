He did so only after making significant concessions to right-wing hardliners\u2014including the ability for a single lawmaker to force a vote to remove him at any time. It was the longest election since 1859."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With the anguish of someone who has spent a decade pursuing a prize, only to see it slipping away from his grasp, Kevin McCarthy told his colleagues in the House Republican caucus, \u201cI\u2019ve earned this job.\u201d And, in a way, he had. The Republican from Bakersfield has kissed an army of frogs, including lobbyists, donors and cranks like congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, to shore up his position, only for 20 House Republicans to turn around and accuse him of infidelity. This tale has its comic side: at one point Matt Gaetz, one of the \u201cNever Kevin\u201d Republican members, wrote to the Architect of the Capitol complaining that some guy called Kevin had moved his desk into the Speaker\u2019s office and that it should be removed forthwith. But the McCarthy saga\u2014the kind of power tussle and public humiliation that Washington loves\u2014also augurs ill for the progress of important legislation in the 118th Congress."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Choosing the Speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives, an important office whose holder is second in line for the presidency, ordinarily requires only one round of voting. The last exception to this was a century ago, when progressive Republicans held up their party\u2019s candidate. With no Speaker, no legislation can progress and no new members can be sworn in. This leaves the people temporarily without representation. The move is therefore a drastic one for the Never Kevins to make. So why did they do it?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not, surely, in opposition to Mr McCarthy\u2019s proposed agenda. Released before the midterm elections in November 2022, his \u201cCommitment to America\u201d would struggle to fill a postcard with policies that are within the power of Congress to enact. Nor do the Never Kevins have much of an agenda themselves. Instead, the plan seems to have been to break the toys so that nobody else can play with them. That dynamic has been present in the Republican caucus for a while. John Boehner, who was besieged by the \u201cHell No\u201d caucus of House Republicans when he was Speaker from 2011 to 2015, observed: \u201cWhat they\u2019re really interested in is chaos\u2026Every time they vote down a bill, they get another invitation to go on Fox News or talk radio. It\u2019s a narcissistic\u2014and dangerous\u2014feedback loop.\u201d And it is getting worse."}, {"role": "body", "text": "While this was going on, Democrats lined up in an orderly fashion behind Hakeem Jeffries, a moderate Democrat from New York. After his elevation to Minority Leader-elect, Mr Jeffries said po-faced things about the chaos on the other side being a sad day for democracy, while his colleagues tittered at the McCarthy spectacle. If they were less concerned with extracting partisan advantage, Democrats might settle on some sensible Republican to back as Majority Leader and hope that a few Republicans could support the same candidate. There is no constitutional reason why the moderates in both parties could not club together, seize control of the legislative agenda and tell the extreme wings of their parties to lump it. Alas, party discipline, tribal loyalty and the threat of primary challengers combine to make this impossible. Instead, Republicans will struggle on until they have a Speaker."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A weakened Speaker will make it even harder for Congress to pass contentious legislation this year. One beholden to the House Republicans\u2019 berserker caucus could find it difficult to avoid a government shutdown, to raise the debt ceiling or to provide additional support to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. This comes after Congress had been on a winning streak, reforming the process for certifying elections and reaffirming gay marriage as the law of the land in 2022. Even divided Congresses can sometimes accomplish quite a lot. But this one is setting out with lead weights attached to its boots. \u25a0"}]}
