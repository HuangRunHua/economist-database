As the electric-vehicle (EV) champion\u2019s share price rose, its worth was couched in terms of the combined value of the next two, then five, then ten biggest carmakers. A year ago Tesla\u2019s market value surpassed $1.2trn, more than most other car companies put together. Since then it has lost 71% of that\u2014a sum exceeding the value of most of the industry. The fortune of its mercurial boss, Elon Musk, has shrivelled by more than $200bn as a result."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The latest blow came on January 3rd, after Tesla missed analysts\u2019 expectations for deliveries for the third quarter in a row and reported that the gap between production and deliveries had grown, suggesting softening demand for its EVs. It lost 12% of its value\u2014roughly $50bn, or one Ford Motor Company\u2014in a day. Even bullish investors now doubt that Mr Musk will fulfil his promise of making 20m cars a year by 2030, or that Tesla\u2019s \u201dAutopilot\u201d is close to becoming a world-changing fully autonomous driving system. Yet the main reason for the market\u2019s recalibration of Tesla\u2019s prospects is a dawning realisation that the company is chiefly a carmaker\u2014and that its boss is not superhuman."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230107_WBC272.png", "imageWidth": "608", "imageHeight": "662", "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Musk has always regarded his company as a tech firm, a peer of digital giants like Alphabet, Apple or Meta, not of old-economy metal-bashers such as Toyota or Volkswagen. For a time, so did the market\u2014first as tech shares soared amid the pandemic-era boom in all things digital, then as they slumped last year, after their growth began to slow and higher interest rates made their promised future profits look less valuable today. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the past few months, however, Tesla\u2019s share price has suffered a sharper correction than big tech. This has coincided with its more mundane tribulations as a car business. Having managed to avoid the worst of the pandemic supply-chain disruptions, Tesla has been caught up in China\u2019s chaotic retreat from the zero-covid policy; its big factory in Shanghai has been hit by virus-related shutdowns. And having set the course for the industry\u2019s EV transition, it now faces plenty of competition from established rivals and a host of newcomers it inspired. Days after Tesla reported the disappointing figures, Volkswagen unveiled its id.7, a challenger to Tesla\u2019s entry-level Model 3 saloon. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "EV-buyers, for their part, are becoming less willing than early adopters to overlook Tesla\u2019s questionable build quality and the interior of a much cheaper car. And the natural Tesla-owners among the wealthy progressive set are less prepared to overlook Mr Musk\u2019s libertarian antics at Twitter, which he bought in October and has mismanaged with gusto\u2014especially now that they have plenty of conscience-salving EV alternatives to choose from."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Tesla is, in other words, no longer the only game in town\u2014and certainly no tech behemoth. As EV-makers go, though, it still looks impressive. In 2022 it delivered 1.3m cars, 40% more than the year before, and opened two new assembly plants. It is working on a smaller, cheaper car and this year will start to deliver its long-awaited Cybertruck pick-up. And it is still worth some $360bn\u2014about as much as the next three biggest carmakers combined. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}]}
