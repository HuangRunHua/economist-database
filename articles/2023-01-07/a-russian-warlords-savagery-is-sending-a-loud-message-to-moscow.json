For Yaroslav Hervolsky, a soldier in a Ukrainian evacuation brigade, it can be indistinguishable. For two-and-a-half months now, Mr Hervolsky has headed under artillery fire into the mud to retrieve colleagues, dead or alive. The job has offered little respite. In mid-December a successful Ukrainian surge pushed Russian forces back a kilometre beyond the boundaries of the town. But it made little difference to Mr Hervolsky\u2019s workload, with Ukrainian losses continuing at the level of dozens daily. Now the Russians are attacking again, and the bodies are piling up. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe the feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cForty bodies stacked up on top of one another. Diesel, blood and rotting flesh. It\u2019s a fucking mess, and you never know if you will be next.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The front line near Bakhmut, a small and tired town 70km (43 miles) north of the city of Donetsk, is currently the most fiercely contested section in Ukraine. It offers little justification for the deaths of so many, which have been running at hundreds daily when Russian losses are included. The town has only limited strategic value, offering little but a source of water and a road-transport hub. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Its real significance lies far away in Moscow, as a proving ground for President Vladimir Putin\u2019s associate Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group, his shadowy mercenary army. Recruiting from convicts and mobilised soldiers, Mr Prigozhin has taken command of the Bakhmut front, and is using it to demonstrate his own bloody vision of the future. But far from everyone in Moscow is happy, not least the military and political leaders whom the warlord has taken to criticising openly. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The extent of collaboration between Wagner and the Russian armed forces was for a long time unclear. But Wagner found a way of co-operating with Russia\u2019s military hierarchy in late autumn. According to Serhiy Cherevaty, a spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s eastern command, this moment coincided with the appointment of a new operational commander, General Sergei Surovikin, a hardliner whose candidacy Mr Prigozhin had lobbied for. Wagner started to be supported by the regular military logistical network, says the spokesman, and even began to fight alongside elite units of the regular Russian army in strike groups. But recent reverses near Bakhmut and problems with logistics appear to have strained the relationship once again."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In late December Wagner released a video showing two of its fighters voicing a staggering attack on the commander-in-chief of Russia\u2019s armed forces, General Valery Gerasimov. The soldiers, who concealed their identities with scarves but appeared to be fighting near Bakhmut, claimed that Russia\u2019s top soldier was holding back munitions. \u201cWe are fighting the entire Ukrainian army, and where are you? There\u2019s only one word to describe what you are\u2014a faggot.\u201d Loyalists condemned the outburst. But Mr Prigozhin later made a point of publicly backing his men. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A Ukrainian missile attack on a barracks in Makiivka, 60km from Bakhmut, on New Year\u2019s Day has fuelled yet more nationalist criticism of the Russian military leadership. The early-morning strike, courtesy of at least four Western-supplied HIMARS high-precision missiles, killed scores of (mostly newly mobilised) soldiers. Russia has said that 89 died; Ukraine says the figure is at least 400. Igor \u201cStrelkov\u201d Girkin, the eccentric former intelligence officer largely responsible for the outbreak of war in the Donbas region in 2014, said he had warned Russian generals about the likelihood of HIMARS strikes on barracks. \u201cThey [the generals] are untrainable in principle,\u201d he barked. Some in Russia have sought to blame the new recruits for their own demise, speculating that Ukraine was able to identify the barracks because the soldiers were, against orders, using their mobile phones.

That concern intensified in October and November, says Tatyana Stanovaya, a political analyst in Moscow, when people in the presidential administration saw the former convict establish a direct channel to Mr Putin. \u201cPrigozhin is attacking governmental institutions with what amount to revolutionary positions, and that is frightening for many of them.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, himself a regular target for Wagner\u2019s criticism, appears to be taking few chances, and has sent his own mercenary grouping, Patriot, to fight in the Donbas.

Ukraine believes that this could start within days; its defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, suggested last week that it could be accompanied by the announcement of martial law. Bakhmut seems certain to bear the brunt of any increase in numbers, as it already has done for months. \u201cOne day they are in disarray, the next they are replenishing, that\u2019s always been the rule,\u201d says Mr Hervolsky. \u201cWe struggle on.
