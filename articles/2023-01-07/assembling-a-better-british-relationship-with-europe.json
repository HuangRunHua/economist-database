He estimates that by the second quarter of 2022, Brexit had left GDP 5.5% smaller and dragged down investment by 11% (see chart 1).

Britain has joined a scheme to rapidly move military kit across borders and volunteered to help police the EU\u2019s southern border against migrants. In December Britain joined an EU programme to build wind farms and electricity interconnectors in the North Sea. For British officials, this is a taste of the near-term future: not yet touching the TCA, but overlaying agreements in areas of common interest.

No sooner had the TCA been signed than Mr Johnson began unpicking the withdrawal treaty that preceded it, and specifically the protocol which in effect keeps the province in the EU\u2019s single market for goods. The protocol means that there are no border controls on the island of Ireland, in an effort to prevent sectarian conflict, but it created a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea instead.

The prime minister says that he wants to take advantage of Brexit by fine-tuning the rule book in a few high-value sectors, such as financial services, artificial intelligence and life-sciences. That would be a manageable concern for the EU. But a second bomb left by Mr Johnson worries diplomats gravely: a monster bill to amend or repeal all EU law by the end of 2023.

If Britain did unilaterally override the Northern Ireland protocol, for instance, the EU would respond swiftly, possibly by suspending the trade deal and levying tariffs. Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc is fragile by design, reflecting the mistrust on which it was built. EU permissions for data-transfers and the clearing of derivatives will lapse in June 2025, and need to be renewed. Agreements on fisheries and electricity expire the year after.

That could allow Britain to fully exploit the TCA, from participation in Horizon to shaving frictions at the border. The TCA is an elaborate structure. A powerful partnership council led by politicians can amend much of the deal. Beneath it sit 18 technical committees in fields such as aviation, customs and intellectual property, tasked with identifying snags and fixes.

But if the Labour Party is in office by then (an election must be held by January 2025, and the polls point to a big Labour victory), that could spell a new beginning. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate for a British government that wants to engage,\u201d says Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor. \u201cI do feel we\u2019d be knocking at an open door if we went in with a different attitude to our future relationship.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Up to a point. To understand the challenge ahead for a Labour government, revisit the painful birth of the TCA. It is a conventional free-trade agreement, similar to the bloc\u2019s deal with Canada. It eliminates tariffs on goods, but does little to remove regulatory barriers or to facilitate the movement of services and people. That was in part the choice of David Frost, Mr Johnson\u2019s confrontational chief negotiator, who was fixated on a concept of British \u201csovereignty\u201d that insisted all obligations under EU law were scrubbed.
