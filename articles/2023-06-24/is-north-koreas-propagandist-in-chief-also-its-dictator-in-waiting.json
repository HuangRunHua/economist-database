Karl Marx called Jeremy Bentham, the father of utilitarianism, the \u201cinsipid, pedantic, leather-tongued oracle of the ordinary bourgeois intelligence of the 19th century\u201d. Vladimir Lenin said that Georgi Plekhanov, a Russian philosopher, had \u201cset a new record in the noble sport of substituting sophistry for dialectics\u201d, a brutal put-down in the lexicon of Marxist jargon."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now there is a new champion of unhinged execration. Whether reviling the \u201cstinky breath emanating from [the] bawling traps\u201d of South Korean missile experts, or telling their president, Yoon Suk-yeol, to \u201cshut his mouth, rather than talking nonsense\u201d, Kim Yo Jong has a barbed tongue befitting the sister of Kim Jong Un, dictator of nominally socialist North Korea. Yet as Sung-Yoon Lee argues in \u201cThe Sister\u201d, behind the snark is a woman of immense power: an influence over her nuke-wielding brother and, possibly, his successor."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Kim came to the world\u2019s attention in 2018 during the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, when she became the first member of North Korea\u2019s ruling family to visit the South since the Korean war. Now she is almost as prominent a symbol of North Korean despotism as the brother she often accompanies. As head of the propaganda operation, her sardonic wit has animated North Korea\u2019s invective for a decade. Her willingness to say vile things to wind up America and South Korea positions her, in Mr Lee\u2019s words, as \u201cEven Worse Cop\u201d to Mr Kim\u2019s \u201cBad Cop\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The opacity of North Korea means that Mr Lee\u2019s claims are often plausible rather than proven. Advanced in an exuberant prose style, they sometimes outstrip the evidence. Forensic scrutiny of greetings and handwriting in guestbooks smacks of over-interpretation, though readers fond of sartorial analysis may enjoy the detailed record of Ms Kim\u2019s fashion choices."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As for his speculation on whether she might succeed her brother: though a fun parlour game for North Korea-watchers, such predictions should not be taken too seriously. As the author recalls, Fujimoto Kenji\u2014the Kim family\u2019s sushi chef until he fled in 2001\u2014may have been the only person outside North Korea to be on the record as having foreseen Kim Jong Un\u2019s ascent."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, marshalling what is known about Ms Kim\u2014a woman of such mystery that the North Korean state has never confirmed that she actually is Mr Kim\u2019s sister\u2014is worthwhile. Mr Lee\u2019s book is not just a profile of a central figure in what is arguably the world\u2019s most brutal dictatorship, but also of her clan. By showing how the family operates, \u201cThe Sister\u201d offers insights into the workings of the only hereditary monarchy to style itself as communist; a regime willing to let millions starve while it spends billions on weapons."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Above all, it shows how Ms Kim and her brother learned the art of diplomacy from their father, Kim Jong Il. The book chronicles the senior Kim\u2019s use of kidnapping and missile tests as overtures to negotiations with America and South Korea. His children dutifully copied these tactics at the summits that followed the Olympics. For now, the younger Mr Kim is fixated on military development, but history suggests he will one day want to talk. Those across the table would do well to have studied the family\u2019s approach to bargaining and be adept at decoding its propaganda. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 67}
