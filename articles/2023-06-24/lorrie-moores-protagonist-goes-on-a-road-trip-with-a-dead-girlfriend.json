(She is better known for her short stories, which have won numerous awards.) Running to only around 200 pages, this deceptively slim volume packs a wallop. It\u2019s not just that the book ponders weighty themes, such as love, death, suicide and the meaning of life. It\u2019s also that Ms Moore writes in a way that demands constant attention, imbuing each of her sentences with an almost antic ingenuity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The American author\u2019s talent\u2014evident in abundance here\u2014is for using humour and beguilingly odd details to yield grand truths about what it means to be human. Her characters are decidedly off-kilter, but feel more real than twee. Lily, Finn\u2019s ex-girlfriend, is a suicidal depressive who works as a \u201claugh therapist\u201d, dressing up as a clown to shake people, mostly children, out of their gloom. (She \u201ceven wore floppy shoes, the laces of which she had once used to strangle herself\u201d.) While Finn is in New York to spend time with his dying brother\u2014whose eyeballs \u201cwere turning the golden earwax brown of bruised fruit\u201d\u2014he is summoned home to Illinois to deal with a crisis concerning Lily, who may have at last succeeded in doing away with herself.

Do they in fact take a long drive together to what will be her final resting place, discussing their fraught love and many trials? Stretches of the book have a hallucinogenic quality, disorienting and unreal. Finn, whose hold on reality was already tenuous, may simply be undone by his grief."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is not entirely clear what relationship Finn\u2019s story has with a series of interspersed letters from the mistress of a 19th-century boarding-house, except that these missives are written to a beloved sister who also happens to be dead. Perhaps life is always haunted by past loves, past wounds, old memories barely remembered, and perhaps these are all essential parts of it. As Finn observes: \u201cNo longer caring about a thing was key to both living and dying.
