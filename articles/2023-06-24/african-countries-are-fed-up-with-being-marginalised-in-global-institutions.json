But African leaders are alarmed by an impending plunge in cheap financing from the International Development Association (IDA), the concessional arm of the World Bank. When covid-19 struck, the IDA raised additional funds and stepped up its support for poor countries. In the past year it has committed perhaps $37bn around the world, up from almost $22bn in 2019.

The Bank is hoping to raise $12bn for a new IDA crisis facility, but half of that would go to Ukraine and Moldova, which are not poor enough to normally qualify for the IDA\u2019s concessional loans and grants.
