Lawyers, bankers and financiers now \u201crecognise that there are cops on the beat\u2026that we\u2019re vigorously looking to protect the American public from illegal mergers,\u201d says Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces consumer-protection and competition laws."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whether Ms Khan, who became the youngest-ever chair of the FTC two years ago this month (she is 34), is a good or bad cop is a matter of fierce debate. Progressives applaud the greater scrutiny she has brought to companies\u2019 conduct\u2014including her latest lawsuit, announced on June 21st, against Amazon, for alleged deception involving its Prime subscription service. Corporate America loathes her more partisan, boisterous approach to merger enforcement. Others accuse her of treating all big firms as criminals and most mergers as offences. David Gelfand, a lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb who worked on antitrust in the Obama administration, compares the approach to \u201cgoing into a neighbourhood and saying you have a crime problem, so you\u2019re going to stop-and-frisk everybody\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s appointment of Ms Khan was a signal of seriousness about fighting corporate concentration. In 2021 the White House issued an executive order calling on agencies across government to focus on competition. It reckoned the dominance of a small number of firms in many markets meant higher prices and lower wages. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Khan was a surprising pick, given her lack of experience as a legal practitioner. (She rose to prominence as a law student in 2017 thanks to an article arguing that Amazon was a monopolist, and later worked for Congress, as a law professor and at a think-tank.) Mr Biden also appointed Jonathan Kanter, a lawyer who had worked against Google, to lead the antitrust division at the Department of Justice (DoJ). The two have spearheaded a campaign to reboot trustbusting. They are pushing beyond the \u201cconsumer-welfare\u201d standard (examining consumer prices) to encourage a broader look at other harms, including to labour and small businesses. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "How successful have they been? They have certainly reframed public thinking about trustbusting. \u201cSix years ago, if you didn\u2019t buy into the consumer-welfare standard, you weren\u2019t a serious person. Now that\u2019s completely gone,\u201d says Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

So far this year there have been 4,955 deals in America, according to Dealogic, a data firm, only 3% fewer than the average for the same period over the five years before. But the total value is down some 40% on the previous average, suggesting firms are avoiding larger acquisitions (see chart). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Target companies are insisting on bigger break-up fees should an acquisition not fly. For example, Figma, a software company, will get $1bn in cash from Adobe, its potential acquirer, if the $20bn deal is scuttled. (The DoJ is said to be considering suing to block it.) But on the legal front the trustbusters, especially at the FTC, have notched up plenty of losses. The most significant court victory has been the Justice Department\u2019s challenge to Penguin Random House\u2019s proposed $2.1bn takeover of a rival publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster. In October a judge concurred that the deal would hand the publisher more pricing control over authors\u2019 earnings, and blocked it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "High-profile lawsuits are still winding their way through the courts, including two against Google (one initiated during the Trump administration, one by Mr Kanter\u2019s office, which is seeking to break up Google\u2019s advertising business). That one will be heard by a jury, instead of a judge, next year, in an effort to bring antitrust back to the people. \u201cIt\u2019s been at least 50 years, if not longer, since we\u2019ve done a case like this in front of a jury,\u201d says Mr Kanter. Another big lawsuit against Amazon, possibly over giving preferential treatment to its own goods and services, is in the offing this year, predicts Konstantin Medvedovsky, an antitrust-watcher who works for a fund betting on merger outcomes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Khan has taken a more speculative approach. Having argued that enforcers of yore were too timid to fight tech deals that snuffed out competition, such as past acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram by Facebook (now Meta), she challenged Meta\u2019s deal for Within, a fledgling maker of virtual-reality fitness apps. But a judge rejected the FTC\u2019s request for an injunction. More recently the FTC sued a second time to block Microsoft\u2019s $69bn acquisition of Activision, a gaming firm, arguing it could suppress competition in the video-game market. A hearing was set to begin on June 22nd\u2014a very public test of whether Ms Khan is choosing the right deals to contest."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lacking a federal privacy law or new antitrust legislation, which Congress has not approved, Ms Khan has persevered alone. But in some instances she has \u201csued on the grounds not of what\u2019s currently illegal but what\u2019s undesirable\u201d, says Matt Perault, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That could backfire. \u201cWhen you start losing cases, you set back the cause,\u201d says Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The administration\u2019s mixed record reveals three things it missed as it set out to attack corporate concentration. First, there is a problem of competing goals. The court is \u201cextraordinarily friendly to large corporate interest\u201d, points out Nancy Rose of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, yet Mr Biden has not made it a priority to appoint judges with expertise in antitrust, pushing instead to diversify the bench by race and background. \u201cIt mystifies me that there hasn\u2019t been more effort to go to school on a strategy that [President Ronald] Reagan used very successfully,\u201d which was nominating like-minded judges on antitrust, says Bill Kovacic of George Washington University Law School, a former FTC chair. To shore up the stability of the financial system, meanwhile, big banks have been allowed to merge with smaller, failed ones: an administration that has tried to fight consolidation has thus enabled it. "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Busting trust"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second problem is that the person with vision for a movement may not be the best person to lead it. \u201cThe arguments they used to achieve power have gotten in the way of exercising it,\u201d says Mr Kovacic. Ms Khan took command after saying that the agencies had been failing for decades to do proper policing. That has dented morale, especially at the FTC. A poll last year of employees found that 49% said they trusted senior leadership, down from 80% in 2019. (Some observe that Mr Kanter has been more diplomatic in his criticism of staff\u2019s past work than Ms Khan, and also more strategic in the cases he has brought.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The administration has also underestimated unintended consequences. Ms Khan has pushed the FTC to try to accomplish a lot through new rules, including banning \u201cnon-competes\u201d (which bar employees from working for a competitor) and asserting its authority to pursue privacy violations. \u201cIn many ways, I view my tenure as a conservative one,\u201d says Ms Khan. \u201cWe\u2019re really going back to the original vision of the FTC as Congress envisioned it.\u201d But the courts and Congress may not see it that way. The Supreme Court could ultimately take up the question of the FTC\u2019s authority and circumscribe it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, antitrust is a long game. \u201cIt took 12 years for the Reagan administration\u201d\u2014eight under Reagan, four under his successor, George H.W. Bush\u2014\u201cto get where they wanted on antitrust doctrine. We\u2019re in year two,\u201d says Tim Wu of Columbia Law School, who worked in the White House on competition policy. Technology, including the rise of AI, will surely affect competition, but it is too early to say how, says Mark Warner, a Democratic senator. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some wonder how much of Mr Biden\u2019s policy will outlast him if he does not win a second term, given his limited victories so far in court and the threat that some of the signature policies will be challenged there, including the ban on non-competes. Others are more optimistic. Bashing big business has become more common among populist Republicans, including a prominent presidential aspirant, Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida. \u201cThe politics of this have changed, and no one wants to be on the other side of it,\u201d insists Mr Wu.
