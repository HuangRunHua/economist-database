He has held ministerial office, uninterrupted, from the premierships of David Cameron to Rishi Sunak. He emerged from the Boris Johnson years with his dignity intact and adoring support from the Conservative Party. His relentless backing, as defence secretary, for Ukraine has earned plaudits abroad. He had also hoped, until recently, he might succeed Jens Stoltenberg as secretary-general of NATO. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he tells The Economist. America wants Mr Stoltenberg to stay, he says, visibly deflated. That would defer the decision to next year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No time for recrimination exists: a \u201cdefence command paper\u201d is due within weeks, updating the previous one from March 2021. It will reflect many lessons from Ukraine. Mr Wallace, a former captain in the Scots Guards, identifies air defences, electronic warfare and \u201cdeep fires\u201d, such as longer-range artillery, as crucial areas for investment. The previous review assumed Britain could expand its ground forces over the decade to 2030. The war has accelerated everything. Challenger tanks will be upgraded 12 months sooner than planned, and new Swedish howitzers, bought in March to replace older guns sent to Ukraine, will be ready next spring. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The snag is money. Before a spending review in March, Mr Wallace asked the Treasury for roughly an extra \u00a310bn ($13bn). He got half, which will largely go to submarine projects, nuclear warheads and the replenishment of munitions. The annual defence budget, adjusted for rampant inflation, will be a puny \u00a31.1bn higher in 2024-25 than in 2021-22. The army, which has lost almost 20,000 soldiers in a decade, is unlikely to grow. He is unapologetic: \u201cI would rather we were medium and perfectly formed than large and hollow.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He is scathing about retired admirals who demand more ships: \u201cThese people would have us lined up with platforms that can\u2019t go to sea or regiments that can\u2019t deploy as long as they can tick the Top Trumps box\u201d, a reference to a classic children\u2019s card game. He is similarly harsh on the military services that he oversees, complaining that the army, navy and air force have favoured \u201ctrophy platforms over the mundane\u201d. The navy, he argues, has over 30 years purchased warships without investing in vital enabling capabilities such as dry docks, cranes and the like. Ship and sub availability has suffered as a result."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ammunition stockpiles remain a serious problem, say defence insiders. Mr Wallace notes that the Storm Shadow cruise missile, which Britain gave to Ukraine in May, has been out of production for a decade. It took almost a year to revive supply chains for NLAW anti-tank weapons, he adds. Arms companies retort that European governments will not place long-term orders. \u201cThe big challenge,\u201d reiterates Mr Wallace, \u201cis we don\u2019t have the money.\u201d The Treasury has agreed that defence spending will rise to 2.5% of GDP \u201cas fiscal and economic circumstances allow\u201d. But unless the prime minister and chancellor set a date, says Mr Wallace, \u201cofficials will ignore it\u201d."}, {"role": "second", "text": "If only I were in charge"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Wallace at times sounds like an opposition politician attacking the Ministry of Defence, not the man who has led it for almost four years. He laments a tendency to defer big projects rather than cancel them. Putting off the f-35 fighter jet cost an additional \u00a3500m, he says; that of an aircraft-carrier, billions. He complains that national regulations have hamstrung technological innovation, with rules on civil airspace impeding the development of drones: \u201cIf you have anything over a certain height, the whole bloody civilian aerospace industry descends on you.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He remains a political enigma. He emerged unscathed from the vicious battle between Mr Johnson, his successor Liz Truss and her replacement, Mr Sunak. His views on non-defence issues are largely a mystery. Some ministers grumble that he is locked in constant warfare with other departments. Tory members like the look and sound of him, and especially his role in shaping Ukraine policy. He deserves \u201cenormous credit in getting arms to Ukraine before the war in the teeth of opposition from some in the White House\u201d, says a military official familiar with those debates. Britain is the second-largest individual contributor of military aid to Ukraine, with over \u00a36bn pledged. Leaked Pentagon documents this spring suggested that 50 British special-forces personnel were in Ukraine, compared with just 14 Americans. A quiet flow of British intelligence has been vital. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "All this was evidently not enough to get America\u2019s support for Mr Wallace\u2019s NATO candidacy. \u201cMaybe they want a prime minister,\u201d he suggests. The White House may have favoured Mark Rutte, the Netherlands\u2019 long-serving leader, but he is said to have twice turned down the job. Mette Frederiksen, Denmark\u2019s prime minister, was until recently a front-runner. But Denmark is far short of meeting the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defence, which irks many eastern European countries that do. Sources close to Mr Wallace stress that the process remains open. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whoever gets the job will have to deal with \u201ca lot of unresolved issues in NATO\u201d, warns Mr Wallace. Many countries have no appetite for the 2% target, he says. And there is the question of the alliance\u2019s role beyond Europe. Britain\u2019s latest foreign-policy review, in March, described China as an \u201cepoch-defining challenge\u201d and talked anew of a \u201ctilt\u201d to the Indo-Pacific. Mr Wallace is more circumspect. \u201cNATO should not mission-creep to the Pacific,\u201d he says, adding that he shares French opposition to opening a NATO office in Tokyo\u2014an initiative he says was agreed by foreign ministers who blindsided him."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Stoltenberg\u2019s eventual successor \u201cis going to have to please both Macron and Biden\u201d, he says. America wants allies to help in confronting China. France emphasises European strategic autonomy. Perhaps surprisingly, for it is not a popular view in his party, Mr Wallace, while hailing America\u2019s extraordinary support for Ukraine, expresses sympathy with Mr Macron, pointing out the importance of collaboration by Europe\u2019s defence industries. \u201cThe French have a point in lots of areas,\u201d he says. \u201cThe answer to everything is not America first, when it comes to procurement.\u201d That is just the sort of thing a secretary-general of NATO could never say. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
