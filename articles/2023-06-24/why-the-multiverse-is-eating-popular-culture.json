By combining characters and cultural references old and new, it can bind together grandparents, parents and children, as well as many brands and the most convoluted plots.

It winks at the audience with references to \u201cStar Wars\u201d, \u201cScooby Doo\u201d and \u201cBack to the Future\u2019\u2018. The effect is of a self-aware palimpsest begat by TikTok and a pinball machine. \u201cLook at this!\u201d cries the Flash\u2014well, one of the two or three Flashes\u2014at the climax. \u201cThese worlds collapsing and colliding!

Using a bowl of spaghetti, a Batman explains that \u201cTime isn\u2019t linear,\u201d though it must be admitted that, during the film\u2019s 144 minutes, it can certainly feel that way. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of this is just good fun, of course. Asking why one enjoys a rollercoaster ride is an invitation to turn delight into homework. Yet the ubiquity of the concept of the multiverse does raise the question: Why now? Technology is clearly part of the answer. It has made these movies possible not just through advances in graphics but by training audiences to toggle among countless open-browser tabs, even as their politics and news media are teaching them that reality is slippery, hard to name or trust. But certain themes that come up again and again suggest that these films also respond to some deeper yearning. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Earlier this year a multiverse movie, \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d, won seven Oscars, including for best picture. It was in essence a Marvel action film dressed up in musings about identity (as are, come to think of it, Marvel movies). Evelyn, played by Michelle Yeoh, is a Chinese-American immigrant who discovers she has great power in an alternative reality and must travel the multiverse to save it from destruction (via a bagel) by another powerful being who turns out to be a different-reality version of her alienated daughter. The two are reconciled and the multiverse saved by Evelyn\u2019s embrace of empathy and kindness.

One hopes the sprogs take that in, along with their $12 popcorn."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As those summaries suggest, these films are also obsessed with choice and contingency. When the show ends and the lights come up you can feel less inspired than sad, considering a society suffused with regret, more preoccupied with individual trauma and with sorting out the past, and recycling its tropes, than dreaming of the future. The escapism on offer is not just the old comic-book fantasy of a humdrum existence transformed by a spider bite. It is that in another reality, right now, the audience member might have made choices that led to a grander life, or at least Hillary Clinton might have campaigned harder in the Midwest.

In his \u201cHitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u201d novels, Douglas Adams romped with the idea of infinity, positing that it meant that anything imaginable, such as a planet of sentient mattresses, must exist somewhere. Each planet of the infinite Spider-Verse hosts a Spider-creature of some sort\u2014a cat, a punk rocker, a Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2014with a costume, powers and an agonising back story like that of the original Spider-Man, who failed to stop a robber who subsequently killed his beloved Uncle Ben.
