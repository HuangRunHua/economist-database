From a different angle, it blazes like a beacon at sunrise and sunset. From the vantage of a departing visitor turning to look back, Hiroshi Sugimoto\u2019s \u201cPoint of Infinity\u201d seems to be matte blue and nearly disappears, leaving a faint outline like a doorway cut into the sky."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Continuously shifting but always sublime, the monumental sculpture is a fitting first commission for San Francisco\u2019s ambitious scheme to turn two Bay islands into a new offshore neighbourhood and art destination. Rising 69 feet (21 metres), the piece is a meditation on eternity and human imagination in a place that has seen its share of innovation and near-death experiences. Perspective is everything, it suggests. As this newspaper and others have reported, San Francisco may have entered an economic \u201cdoom loop\u201d. The spire is a sliver of hope for a rebirth."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The rocky outcrop called Yerba Buena Island sprouted the adjacent man-made expanse named Treasure Island in the 1930s as a Depression-era project to host America\u2019s world\u2019s fair. The Golden Gate International Exhibition opened on it in 1939, the pavilions stocked with art, including a huge mural begun on the spot by Diego Rivera. The aim was to showcase America\u2019s modernity and urban progress. Decades later the city\u2019s goal is the same: to reinvent the urban experience for the 21st century, as a walkable community of 8,000 homes surrounded by water and parks and world-class works of art."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Taking inspiration from two famous arty islands, Governors Island in New York and Naoshima in Japan, the city\u2019s arts commission seized on the rare opportunity to build \u201ca magnet for cultural tourism\u201d from scratch on the site, which was occupied by the Us Navy after the fair. The private development has a budget of some $5bn to build homes, shops, hotels and a ferry landing. The investors are subsidising the dwellings designated as \u201caffordable\u201d (around a quarter of the total), along with nearly 300 acres of parks and a budget of $50m for public art."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Sugimoto\u2019s sculpture was chosen unanimously by the commission from 495 contenders, says Jill Manton, director of the city\u2019s Public Art Trust. The Japanese artist, who lives and works in Tokyo and New York, was initially approached to make a piece for San Francisco\u2019s airport, but the hilltop location seized his imagination. The spectacular spot with panoramic views called for a special installation, one representing what Mr Sugimoto calls \u201chumanity\u2019s yearning for the infinite\u201d. His sculpture is based on the mathematical formula for infinity, and is made up of two converging curved lines, rendered in high-grade mirrored steel, which get closer and closer but never meet. The piece tapers to a vanishing point only 21 millimetres wide."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is meant to be \u201csymbolic of humankind\u2019s pursuit of knowledge and innovation\u201d, Mr Sugimoto said at its unveiling earlier this month. It is also a meditation on time, one of his enduring interests as a photographer and architect. Acting as a huge sundial, it will throw a shadow on a precise point at noon on the autumn and spring equinoxes, registering the movement of the Earth. When it is formally opened later this year, visitors will wend their way up an elegant approach to a park designed by Walter Hood, an acclaimed landscape architect."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For V. Fei Tsen, president of the city development agency that is overseeing the project, the piece \u201csets the tone for what this island can be for art\u201d. Not just international stars but local artists and community schemes will be represented. In its time Naoshima, too, was a disused military base that was revived through culture, Ms Tsen points out. Neither a recent spate of lawsuits between the investors nor San Francisco\u2019s wider woes have dismayed her. \u201cEconomic cycles always come into play,\u201d she says phlegmatically. Like many in a place built on the booms and busts of gold rushes, her credo is: \u201cI have faith.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 65}
