In 2008 he was kidnapped, beaten and drugged by unknown assailants, before being dumped outside the capital. Some 15 years later, he is still being targeted. On June 14th, a court sentenced Mr Zamora to six years in prison for money-laundering and ordered him to pay a $40,000 fine. He was cleared of charges of blackmail and influence-peddling. The case is widely considered spurious. It is a worrying sign of eroding press freedom ahead of the first round of a presidential election on June 25th."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Alejandro Giammattei, the outgoing president (he cannot run again), insists the trial had nothing to do with journalism and everything to do with Mr Zamora\u2019s business activities, which included asking an acquaintance to deposit $40,000 in cash in a bank for him. Mr Zamora argues that the use of cash was necessary to protect donors from the ire of the authorities. El Peri\u00f3dico, the newspaper Mr Zamora founded in 1996, closed in May\u2014he claims that the authorities repeatedly intimidated its donors and journalists (the government denies these allegations).

Ahead of this year\u2019s presidential election, the right to take part in politics has also been \u201cseverely violated\u201d, she notes. The country\u2019s electoral authorities have made apparently arbitrary decisions to bar candidates, including Carlos Pineda, a businessman who became the surprise front-runner after campaigning on TikTok, a video app."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is part of a broader trend of democratic backsliding. Several countries in Central America are moving in the direction of Daniel Ortega\u2019s Nicaragua, the original model for despotism in the region. The rule of law is quickly eroding in El Salvador under Nayib Bukele, its millennial president. Unlike these two other nations, though, Guatemala is not dominated by one individual. Rather, its political, military and economic elites entrench their hold on power through a system described by WOLA as \u201ccorporate authoritarianism\u201d.

Since November two dozen journalists have gone into exile."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When interviewed in May the founder of El Peri\u00f3dico was handcuffed, well-dressed and gaunt after ten months in a cell.
