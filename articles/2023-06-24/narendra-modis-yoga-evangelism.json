On one of its giant plinths is a statue of Charles James Napier, conqueror of Sindh in 1843. On another is Henry Havelock, who beat the rebels at Kanpur in 1857. On June 20th the square hosted a more contemporary display of Indian empire-building\u2014in the form of 300 British Indians and assorted others (including The Economist) practising yoga."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was an early celebration of international yoga day, a UN initiative launched at the urging of Narendra Modi in 2015. Critics of the Indian prime minister\u2019s Hindu-nationalist agenda view his yoga evangelism with suspicion, given the practice\u2019s Hindu origins. The yoga chant \u201cOm\u201d is a sacred sound in Hindu scripture. The Sun Salutation, a common set of yoga poses, is associated with Hindu prayer. Yet the annual yoga day is, like the practice itself, more obviously inclusive. It also signifies increased Indian confidence and visibility\u2014and Mr Modi\u2019s genius for marketing his country and himself. A daily practitioner, the Indian leader himself marked yoga day by leading a multinational contortion at the UN headquarters in New York.

Though relatively few were diehard Modi fans, most said the prime minister had raised the prestige of Indian culture. \u201cHe\u2019s not polite but he\u2019s pushy, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d says Mohit Singh Bharti, 31, mortgage adviser and immigrant from Jaipur.
