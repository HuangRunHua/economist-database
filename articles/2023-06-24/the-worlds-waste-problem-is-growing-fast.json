By Oliver Franklin-Wallis. Hachette Books; 400 pages; $30. Simon &amp; Schuster; \u00a320"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In \u201cOur Mutual Friend\u201d, Charles Dickens\u2019s last complete novel, stray paper \u201changs on every bush, flutters in every tree, is caught flying by the electric wires, haunts every enclosure\u201d. Since those words were published in the 1860s, the world\u2019s waste problem has changed in both scale and composition. These days plastic in one form or another is strewn on verges, clogs rivers and swirls around oceans in vast gyres. Circulated by winds and tides, tiny nanoplastics have penetrated all manner of watery ecosystems, reaching both the Earth\u2019s poles and its highest peaks, with unknown consequences for the planet."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Worried by the pollution caused by a throwaway culture, Oliver Franklin-Wallis\u2014a British journalist who has written for The Economist\u2014heads to places that best illustrate this profligacy. In \u201cWasteland\u201d he visits an Indian landfill that is piled almost as high as the Qutub Minar, a well-known minaret in Delhi; Ghana\u2019s largest second-hand clothes market, through which 15m garments are thought to pass every week; a former mining area in America that is blighted by dumped lead, zinc and cadmium; and a defunct nuclear-power plant in the north-west of England, which contrasts starkly with the natural beauty of the nearby Lake District. He sees these places as evidence of human myopia about the Earth\u2019s fragility and the finitude of its resources."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rubbish, the author notes, is often deposited \u201con the margins, and on the marginalised\u201d. He explains the concept of \u201ctoxic colonialism\u201d, whereby trash is shipped by wealthier countries to poorer ones, and shows its detrimental effects up close. But he also acknowledges that the waste trade can sometimes be beneficial to communities on the receiving end: what one person deems useless, another sees as a potential source of income."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Throughout his tour of disfigured landscapes and industrial incinerators, Mr Franklin-Wallis decries the tactic of \u201cplanned obsolescence\u201d: ie, the marketing of products that quickly need to be replaced. A notorious early-20th-century example was the \u201clight-bulb cartel\u201d, who conspired to slash the lifespan of their filaments. These days items ranging from \u201cfast fashion\u201d to wireless earbuds are liable to be thrown away or forgotten in a drawer before long."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The book comes alive in its descriptions of people and places. A paper-mill worker in southern England is \u201cbald and aquiline, monkish, with the gentle stoop of an under-watered tulip\u201d. The appearance of a zero-waste zealot in the north of England is \u201csomewhere between affable climate activist and festival drug-dealer\u201d. The colours and buzz of a market day in Accra are sketched in short, lively sentences, as is the dusty decay of an abandoned town in Oklahoma. Happily, Mr Franklin-Wallis writes stylishly about ugly things: cranes at a site for burning garbage \u201cmove slowly, Damoclesian, their noise a deep rumble\u201d; the flow of rubbish at a waste plant is \u201crelentless, the choreography balletic\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWasteland\u201d is heavy on facts, many of them interesting and sobering. Twenty thousand plastic bottles are sold around the world every second. The world produced 2bn tonnes of solid waste in 2016, a figure that will rise to 3.3bn tonnes by 2050. But the piles of numbers can occasionally be a strain. At such moments, readers may find themselves agreeing that waste is \u201cnot the most appealing subject\u201d for a book, as the author himself admits near the beginning of his."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Overall, however, he dispels that impression. \u201cWasteland\u201d does not offer novel solutions to the problem of waste. Mr Franklin-Wallis wants you to buy less and recycle more, along with a crackdown on \u201cgreenwashing\u201d (whereby companies make exaggerated claims about their environmental credentials). But he succeeds in outlining the size of the challenge. His book should prompt serious discussion in boardrooms and parliaments. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 68}
