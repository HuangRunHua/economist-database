However, by choosing the headline \u201cA land of useless workers\u201d (June 10th) to describe productivity in Latin America you fell short of those standards. As a Mexican citizen, I have met and learned from informal workers. They typically work more than eight hours a day in rigorous, often unsafe conditions. Sadly, many of these workers cannot even afford healthy and balanced diets to provide them with the necessary energy that their jobs demand. They receive very low economic remuneration and perhaps even less social recognition.

In Chile productivity lags across industries, including copper mining, where the best local operation uses 44% more labour than international peers. There are also notable productivity problems in the public sector. The reasons for this include gaps in best-practice management, a low-quality education system, an inadequate regulatory framework and insufficient innovation rates.
