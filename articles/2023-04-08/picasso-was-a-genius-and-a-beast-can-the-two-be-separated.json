Can the two be separated?", "subtitle": "It\u2019s the wrong question to ask, says \u201cMonsters\u201d, a provocative new book by Claire Dederer", "hashTag": "Culture", "authorName": "The Economist", "publishDate": "2023-04-05T09:46:09Z", "contents": [{"role": "body", "text": "Look closely at \u201cWoman with a Yellow Necklace\u201d, a painting by Pablo Picasso of 1946. The woman is Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, his partner at the time. Notice, in particular, what appears to be a Marilyn-esque beauty spot on the figure\u2019s left cheek. That mark is said to represent a cigarette burn, seared onto the sitter\u2019s face during a row with the artist."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In his astonishing range and invention, Picasso\u2014who died 50 years ago, on April 8th 1973\u2014was among the 20th century\u2019s greatest artists. He was also an abusive goat, with a nauseating fondness for much younger women (40 years younger in Ms Gilot\u2019s case). \u201cOnce they were bled dry,\u201d his granddaughter Marina wrote of his women, \u201che would dispose of them.\u201d Two went on to kill themselves."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In \u201cMonsters\u201d, her new book, Claire Dederer identifies Picasso as an archetypal modern genius: an artist whose vices have been seen as excusable by-products of his vatic talent. Only men, she notes, are ever granted this licentious dispensation. Her book asks how she and readers today should feel about luminaries who \u201cdid or said something awful, and made something great\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even those who try to duck this problem can\u2019t. Even for listeners bent on separating art and artist, \u201cAge Ain\u2019t Nothing but a Number\u201d, a hip-hop track, will be tarnished by knowing its provenance. (It was written by R. Kelly, a convicted sex abuser, and sung by Aaliyah, who became his \u201cwife\u201d at 15.) Conversely, even those repulsed by Wagner\u2019s anti-Semitism may find themselves stirred by \u201cRide of the Valkyries\u201d. Often publishers, film bosses and other gatekeepers tackle this quandary on punters\u2019 behalves."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The trouble, for most people, is where to draw the line, or rather several. The variables involved are all slippery and subjective. One is the gravity of the artists\u2019 sins, a judgment liable to change over time. The same goes for views on their stature. Time itself is a factor. Today\u2019s scandals will one day be ancient history; long-gone victims can be less compelling than living, weeping ones. Abjuring masterpieces by dead artists\u2014such as Picasso\u2014can seem a punishment of yourself rather than of them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Dederer fantasises about a calculator that could weigh \u201cthe heinousness of the crime versus the greatness of the art\u201d. In reality, she says, the dilemma is inevitable\u2014and insoluble. Rewatching \u201cChinatown\u201d, she cannot but remember the gruesome sex offence committed by its director, Roman Polanski. A disgraced biography, in her apt metaphor, is a stain that cannot be wished away. And in this social-media-saturated age\u2014when \u201ceverything is everyone\u2019s business\u201d\u2014there is a lot of biography about."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the same time, you cannot switch off the love you feel for art made by reprobates. Your leg still jiggles to \u201cI Want You Back\u201d, despite what you know about Michael Jackson\u2019s proclivities. For all the disputed allegations against Woody Allen\u2014and his marriage to his ex-partner\u2019s daughter\u2014\u201cAnnie Hall\u201d is still funny."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No one is entirely a monster, Ms Dederer says by way of mitigation, both for stained virtuosos and angst-ridden fans. There is a bit of monstrosity in everyone, she adds, especially artists, for whom bloody-minded selfishness is useful. But her main argument for reconciling yourself to the art/artist question is that it is the wrong one to ask."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What difference does it really make, she writes, if you deprive a wicked genius of your cash or attention? Her case is couched in anti-capitalism; she thinks celebrity is generated and monetised by the system, which, like the house in a casino, wins whatever you choose to consume. You can doubt that reasoning but buy her conclusion: that renouncing Picasso, say, \u201cis essentially meaningless as an ethical gesture\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Art is important. Calling out abusers is valid and important too. But in the end, Ms Dederer argues, dust-ups over cancellations are a kind of shadow boxing. The key fights are over broader issues in society, or over private relationships and behaviour. \u201cThe way you consume art doesn\u2019t make you a bad person, or a good one,\u201d she counsels. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to find some other way to accomplish that.\u201d In the narrow realm of culture, this is consoling: \u201cYou are off the hook.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many shows and events will mark the 50th anniversary of Picasso\u2019s death. Attend one, and you will encounter his revelatory vision\u2014and, indivisibly, his misogyny, which courses through his sexualised contortions of female bodies. And, like it or not, if you come across \u201cWoman with a Yellow Necklace\u201d, you will see the cigarette burn."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:A bold \u201cGuys &amp; Dolls\u201d holds lessons for the future of theatre (Mar 23rd)It\u2019s war at this year\u2019s Oscars (Mar 8th)How an Ethiopian prince came to be buried at Windsor Castle (Feb 23rd)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Back Story column got its name"}]}
