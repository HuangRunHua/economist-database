Rusting anti-ship barricades line its beaches. The skyline of Xiamen, a sub-provincial but by comparison massive Chinese city just across the water, is visible from its shores. In 2001 a ferry started operating to Xiamen, turning the island into a centre of tourism and business exchange. Many in Kinmen would like to be closer still\u2014some have proposed a bridge and want the electricity grids to be connected. They hope not just to make Kinmen more prosperous, but also that closer integration with the mainland might be the best way to avoid being attacked. \u201cAmerica, China, Taiwan, whatever you do, just leave us out of it,\u201d says Chen Yang-hue, a local councillor. He is one of several local politicians to demand, in February, that Taiwan withdraw its troops and \u201cdemilitarise\u201d the island. Taiwan\u2019s central government has not issued a response.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For decades, Kinmen endured routine shelling from China even as Taiwan turned the county into a garrison, with as many as 100,000 soldiers stationed there. Kinmenese were forced to carry supplies for the soldiers, to live under curfew and to train in village fighting units from the age of 16. Hong Ming-hwa, 88, was a dock worker when China subjected Kinmen to a burst of shelling in 1958, firing more than 470,000 shells in 44 days. More than 600 people died. He remembers soldiers fleeing while he and other locals waded past dead bodies in the water to save as many people as they could. \u201cIf there was no Kinmen then, there would be no Taiwan now,\u201d he says. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many Kinmenese feel that Taiwan owes them a debt of peace. Its pro-China politicians complain that Taiwan\u2019s politics are blocking Kinmen from prosperity, and that they have been left behind while mainland China and the rest of Taiwan prosper. That is an illusion: Kinmen\u2019s average disposable income per person in 2021 was roughly $13,200, compared with $21,800 in Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, and $9,980 in Xiamen."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the contrast between the dozy villages of Kinmen and the high-rises of Xiamen still gives rise to envy. Kinmenese want to be part of China\u2019s growth and China wants to invest, says Chen Yu-Jen, who represents Kinmen in the national parliament: \u201cThey will treat us well, make us a model, and Kinmen can develop and prosper. But Taiwan won\u2019t accept this.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Supporters of demilitarisation also blame Taiwan, not China, for threatening Kinmen\u2019s safety. China does not want to attack Kinmen in the first place because they are family, argues Mr Chen, the councillor.

Kinmenese are not discussing whether peace through integration with China would mean a loss of freedoms, says Wang Ling, 37. Ms Wang grew up in Kinmen and went to university in Taipei. She used to argue with her Taiwanese classmates, insisting that she was Chinese because of Kinmen\u2019s Fujianese heritage. Kinmenese speak the same southern Fujianese dialect as people in Xiamen. Many still live in traditional Fujianese homes with curving red roofs. But gradually she realised her affinity to China was cultural, not political. In Taipei she joined labour-rights campaigns. Later, she studied in Beijing, where she saw how grassroots activists were suppressed. Now she calls herself Taiwanese. Already Kinmenese politicians act \u201clike obedient children\u201d, not equals, when they interact with Chinese officials, she says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And just because Kinmen says \u201cno war\u201d does not mean that it will not happen, says Tung Sen-po, a county councillor who opposes the demilitarisation plan as unrealistic. Instead Kinmen\u2014and Taiwan\u2014should prepare for the worst while holding on to their democratic values, he says. That is a tough message for a people who feel they have little control over their own future. \u201cWe are the pawns, the chess pieces,\u201d says Mr Tung, \u201cnot the chess players.\u201d\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": ""}], "id": 17}
