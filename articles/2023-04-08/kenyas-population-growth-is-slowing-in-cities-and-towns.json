At last count, women in the mainly Somali counties of the arid north-east, many of whom drift into the city, still on average bear more than seven children each. This rate is common elsewhere across northern Kenya, where drought, conflict and poverty dangerously persist. It is also high in some parts of the west, near Lake Victoria, where polygamy among some groups is still common.

At the end of the 19th century, when British colonisers first imposed themselves, the populace may have been as small as a million or so. Kenya\u2019s first formal estimate, in 1921, put it at under 3m. At independence in 1963 it had hit 9m, and it is now close to 55m. At this rate the population could hit 85m by 2050, according to the UN, which would be \u201ccompletely unsustainable\u201d, laments a conservationist who promotes the co-existence of wildlife and people, particularly dirt-poor pastoralists.

It also shows a marked difference between town and countryside. On average, urban women are expected to have 2.8 babies each, which is one fewer than the 3.9 of their rural cousins. Among the burgeoning middle class, two children is becoming the norm."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The survey hints at how this is being achieved and at the challenges that remain. Overall 57% of married women use modern contraceptives, with even higher proportions in counties surrounding Nairobi. Yet Mandera county, up against the Somali border, has a fertility rate of eight. Just 2% of married women there use birth control, which is frowned upon by many Kenyan Muslims and evangelical Christians."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A former president, Mwai Kibaki, who stepped down in 2013, regularly spoke out in favour of family planning.
