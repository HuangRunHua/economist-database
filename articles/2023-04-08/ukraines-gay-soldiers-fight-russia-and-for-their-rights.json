In his first weeks his room-mates at training camp found some \u201cspicy texts\u201d, as he puts it, and he was bullied. \u201cThere was aggression.

Now Mr Lagoyda is serving on the front line and all the 180 people in his unit know he\u2019s gay. He posts selfies looking fit in his camo fatigues with washboard abs and immaculate stubble. He is also a member of LGBTIQMilitary, an Instagram account that features lgbt people in military service. It even has a link to buy merch: mugs and cloth patches depicting an armoured unicorn breathing fire. \u201cWherever I serve,\u201d says Mr Lagoyda, \u201ceveryone tells me: \u2018Because you are here at war, in principle I have no right to call you gay or a faggot; you are just a person who is protecting us on an equal footing\u2019.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "He is not alone.
