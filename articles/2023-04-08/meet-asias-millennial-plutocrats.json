The continent\u2019s tycoons did more than their African or Latin American counterparts to push the developing world\u2019s share of that total from 37% to 52% over the decade. The combined revenue of the continent\u2019s 80 or so family firms that rank within the world\u2019s 500 biggest such concerns surpassed $1trn last year, according to researchers at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland (see chart 1)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Overall, the results of the three-generation test so far look encouraging for Asia\u2019s ageing patriarchs (most are men) as they seek a safe pair of hands to which to entrust their legacy. The grandchildren of the region\u2019s founder tycoons may well be in shirtsleeves, but out of sartorial choice rather than necessity. They are worldlier than their elders, who built their fortunes on local businesses that thrive in periods of rapid economic development, such as construction or natural resources. They often blend the needs of the family business with personal preferences. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the same time, they are keenly aware of their responsibility to avoid the prodigal trap.

Most have attended university abroad, often in America. Adrian Cheng, grandson of Cheng Yu-tung, a Hong Kong property tycoon, went to Harvard University.

What sets them apart from their parents is their career paths into the family businesses. Like their fathers, Mr Cheng, Mr Riady and Ms Ambani all now work for these. Mr Cheng runs New World Development, the family\u2019s property arm; Mr Riady is chief executive of Lippo Karawaci, the family empire\u2019s property developer; Ms Ambani heads Reliance\u2019s retail operation.

Mr Cheng started his career in investment banking, including at UBS, a Swiss lender. Ms Ambani was a consultant at McKinsey. Mr Riady worked in private equity.

Korawad Chearavanont, great-grandson of the founder of CP Group, Thailand\u2019s largest private company, launched a tech startup that provides social-media features for apps.

The shift to more vocally progressive views in some areas, like inequality, may be driven by pragmatism, too. \u201cIn societies where economic growth isn\u2019t being shared, they want to break you up, tax you, regulate you, they presume the worst,\u201d says one heir."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Giving heirs experience beyond the family concern reflects a more open-minded parenting style.

Reliance, which made its name in petrochemicals, is now India\u2019s biggest telecoms firm and digital platform. Lippo has gained greater exposure to young technology firms in South-East Asia through Venturra Capital, its VC subsidiary. That young business scions have a wider circle of contacts than do their parents is useful for their families\u2019 firms: rubbing shoulders with would-be startup founders, venture capitalists, consultants and bankers offers opportunity for early dibs on interesting investment opportunities.

But it is not risk-free. Many developing-world commercial empires were constructed by combining business acumen and political nous. In 2001 Raymond Fisman, then at Columbia University, showed that whenever rumours about the failing health of Suharto, Indonesia\u2019s dictator, intensified in the mid-1990s, publicly listed firms that were close to the government, many of which were family-run, underperformed those with fewer political ties. Similar research suggests a positive association between the political allegiances of South Korean companies and the government: firms with ties to the ruling party benefited even after the country\u2019s transition to democracy and economic liberalisation in the late 1980s."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In many emerging markets, navigating interest groups and local power brokers remains an important part of doing business. It can ensure preferential treatment, access to state contracts or just a better understanding of the often Byzantine bureaucracy. American business schools will not teach Asia\u2019s young business elites such skills. To preserve their family empires, they will also have to learn a thing or two from their elders. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}]}
