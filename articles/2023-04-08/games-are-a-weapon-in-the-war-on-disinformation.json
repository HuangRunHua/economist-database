City prioritises elitist pets over our kids!\u201d\u2014and funny memes.

The free 15-minute online game explores the dark art of spreading lies online; players get points for the passion of their posts and shareability of their memes. It is good fun, with a witty script and futuristic cyberpunk style. It is also an educational tool, funded by the Global Engagement Centre (GEC), a branch of the US State Department which aims to \u201crecognise, understand, expose and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Games such as \u201cCat Park\u201d are an ingenious response to a widespread problem. Fake news and conspiracy theories are in rich supply; demand for them is high in polarised countries across the world. Many governments are mulling policies to try to limit their spread, since internet users often struggle to discern legitimate sources from nefarious ones. Last year a study by Ofcom, a British regulator, found that 30% of the country\u2019s adults hardly consider the truthfulness of information they read online. About 6% give no thought to the veracity of stories. Around a quarter failed to spot fake social-media accounts.

In 2020 it collaborated with the GEC on \u201cHarmony Square\u201d, in which players seek to destabilise an idyllic neighbourhood by using falsehoods to foment disunity. During the pandemic, it released \u201cGo Viral!\u201d, a five-minute game that gets players to scrutinise misleading information about covid-19.

Aimed primarily at citizens in the West, the games are based on the idea of \u201cactive inoculation\u201d: just as individuals build up resistance to a disease after a vaccine, after playing \u201cCat Park\u201d or \u201cHarmony Square\u201d they are more wary of internet skulduggery. A study by the University of Cambridge found that players of \u201cHarmony Square\u201d were better at spotting dodgy content and less likely to share it.
