It is built on three pillars: puberty-blockers (formally known as GnRH antagonists), cross-sex hormones and surgery. The goal was to alter the patient\u2019s body to more closely match their sense of cross-sex identity, and thereby relieve their mental anguish. A pair of papers published in 2011 and 2014 by Annelou de Vries, one of the Dutch protocol\u2019s pioneers, reported on the experiences of some of the first patients. They concluded that symptoms of depression decreased among patients taking puberty-blockers, and that gender dysphoria \u201cresolved\u201d and psychological functioning \u201csteadily improved\u201d after cross-sex hormones and surgery."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Transition ignition"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Puberty-blockers do what their name suggests. The idea is that suspending unwanted sexual development can give patients time to think about their dysphoria, and whether or not they wish to pursue more drastic interventions. The same family of drugs is used to treat \u201ccentral precocious puberty\u201d, in which puberty begins very early. Some countries also use them to chemically castrate sex offenders. As with many other medicines used in children, the use of puberty-blockers in gender medicine is \u201coff-label\u201d, meaning that they do not have regulatory approval for that purpose."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Patients who decide to proceed with their transition are then prescribed cross-sex hormones. Males will see the development of breasts and alterations to how fat is stored on the body.

Male patients can have artificial breasts implanted. More elaborate procedures, in which females have a simulated penis built from a tube of skin harvested from the forearm or the thigh, or males have an artificial vagina made in a \u201cpenile inversion\u201d, are performed extremely rarely on minors.

The academic evidence it found was weak, discouraging and in some cases contradictory. The studies suggest puberty-blockers had little impact on patients. Cross-sex hormones may improve mental health, but the certainty of that finding was low, and NICE warned of the unknown risks of lasting side-effects. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For both classes of drug, NICE assessed the quality of the papers it analysed as \u201cvery low\u201d, its poorest rating. Some studies reported results but made no effort to analyse them for statistical significance. Cross-sex hormones are a lifelong treatment, yet follow-up was short, ranging from one to six years. Most studies followed only a single set of patients, who were given the drugs, instead of comparing them with another set who were not. Without such a \u201ccontrol group\u201d, researchers cannot tell whether anything that happened to the patients in the studies was down to the drugs, to other treatments the patients might be receiving (such as counselling or antidepressants), or to some other, unrelated third factor."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The upshot is that it is hard to know whether any of the supposed effects reported in the studies, whether positive or negative, are actually real.

But ES\u2019s review did not set out to look at whether gender-affirming care helped resolve gender dysphoria or improve mental health by any measure. It focused instead on side-effects, for which it found only weak evidence. This omission, says Gordon Guyatt of McMaster University, makes the review \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d. WPATH, for its part, did look at the psychological effects of blockers and hormones. It found scant, low-quality evidence. Despite these findings, both groups continue to recommend physical treatments for gender dysphoria, and insist that their reviews and the resulting guidelines are sound. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One justification for puberty-blockers is that they \u201cbuy time\u201d for children to decide whether to proceed with cross-sex hormones or not.

The troubling one is that puberty-blockers lock at least some children in to further treatment. \u201cTime to Think\u201d, a new book about gids by a British journalist, Hannah Barnes, cites British medical workers concerned by the latter possibility. They say patients received blockers after cursory and shallow examinations."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Dutch researchers weigh both explanations. \u201cIt is likely that most people starting [puberty-blockers] experience sustained gender dysphoria,\u201d they write.

One problem is that those who abandon a transition are likely to stop talking to their doctors, and so disappear from the figures. The estimates that do exist vary by an order of magnitude or more.

And even then, the final assessment of outcomes occurred around 18 months after surgery\u2014a very short timeframe for a treatment whose effects will last a lifetime. (The first patient, \u201cFG\u201d, was followed for longer. In 2011, when in his mid-30s, researchers reported his feelings of \u201cshame about his genital appearance\u201d and of \u201cinadequacy in sexual matters\u201d. A decade later though, things had improved, and FG had a steady girlfriend.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The critiques also suggest that the finding that gender dysphoria improved with treatment may have been an artefact of how the participants were assessed. Before treatment, female patients were asked to agree or disagree with such statements as, \u201cEvery time someone treats me like a girl I feel hurt.\u201d This established their desire to be seen as male. After blockers, hormones and surgery the same individuals were asked questions on a scale originally developed for those born male. It offered statements such as, \u201cEvery time someone treats me like a boy I feel hurt.\u201d Naturally, patients who preferred to be seen as male disagreed. In effect, the yardstick was changed in a way that might be seen as making positive outcomes more likely. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Finally, the original studies seem to have inadvertently cherry-picked patients for whom the treatment was most effective. The researchers started with 111 adolescents, but excluded those whose treatment with puberty-blockers did not progress well. Of the remaining 70, others were omitted from the final findings because they did not return questionnaires, or explicitly refused to do so, or dropped out of care or, in one case, died of complications from genital surgery. The data may therefore exclude precisely those patients who were harmed by or dissatisfied with their treatment.
