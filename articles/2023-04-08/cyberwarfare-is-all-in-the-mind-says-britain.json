Now, he says, \u201cboth of those framings have lost quite a lot of their power\u201d. Instead ncf operations reflect \u201cthe doctrine of cognitive effect\u201d\u2014the idea that offensive cyber is less about turning the lights off in Moscow than a stealthy and subtle form of psychological warfare."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In essence, the ncf\u2014staffed by gchq, mi6 and the armed forces\u2014hacks computers and their networks. Today, that means everything from smartphones to fighter jets. Hacking can do physical damage, as America and Israel showed in the Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear facilities over a decade ago. It can also wipe data, as Russia has done prolifically in Ukraine. But the ncf sees its ultimate goal as influencing the behaviour of people or groups, whether criminals, terrorists or state adversaries. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sometimes that means simple disruption, such as disabling a server or app that terrorists are using to communicate. But it usually calls for a more artful approach. \u201cCovert techniques may be used to reach out to individuals who pose a significant threat,\u201d says the ncf. In 2018, for instance, the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command sent targeted messages to Russian hackers to dissuade them from interfering in that year\u2019s American midterm elections. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "More often the aim is to stay in the shadows. \u201cThe intent is sometimes that adversaries do not realise that the effects they are experiencing are the result of a cyber operation,\u201d says the ncf.

British cyber operations against Islamic State during 2016-17, for instance, not only hampered IS\u2019s communications, but also made its operatives distrust the orders sent over them. \u201cAdversaries aren\u2019t very good at identifying and attributing uk cyber activity,\u201d boasts Mr Babbage, \u201cand that\u2019s quite a good thing.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230408_BRP502.jpg", "imageWidth": "1280", "imageHeight": "720", "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Inducing paranoia among enemies is a long-standing aim of covert action, says Rory Cormac, of the University of Nottingham. Historically, he says, mi6 \u201cset people very discreetly against one another so that they destroyed each other\u201d. He points to Operation Flitter, a (failed) effort by the agency to induce a purge in the Soviet leadership in the 1950s. During Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles spooks routinely sowed division within the Irish Republican Army, for instance by spreading rumours that one faction was plotting against another."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In many ways, cognitive effect is a repackaging of these dark arts. But one reason why the ncf is coming out of the shadows is to emphasise that it is a \u201cresponsible\u201d cyber power. It says its operations are precisely targeted, calibrated to avoid escalation and accountable to ministers and Parliament\u2014the Intelligence and Security Committee oversees operations. \u201cWhen the Russians talk about psychological operations, they are much more often looking at population scale,\u201d says Mr Babbage. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about cognitive effect, we\u2019re really talking about decision-makers, or usually quite small...groups.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine underscores the difference. Its cyber-attack on communication satellites inadvertently disrupted nearly 6,000 wind turbines in Germany. Russian digital propaganda has been crude and scattershot, using deepfake videos and fake news outlets. \u201cOur currency really is the truth,\u201d insists Mr Babbage. \u201cThe wider our audience, the more critical it is that what we\u2019re putting out is true.\u201d Above all, he says, the Russian hackers waging information warfare appear to be disconnected from those disrupting Ukrainian computer networks. \u201cThat is exactly counter to our doctrine of cognitive effect, which is about bringing them both together.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Britain is still learning what that means in practice. In the past it often thought military cyber-attacks would be tactical\u2014say, electronic warfare to take out a particular radar at a key moment. Now, says Mr Babbage, they seem most useful at the \u201ctheatre\u201d level: influencing enemy generals in their headquarters, rather than colonels in the field. Two military lawyers sit within the ncf to advise on how the laws of war might apply."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The ncf refuses to discuss specific operations, citing the benefits of ambiguity.

Meanwhile the ncf is a work in progress. It is developing versatile tools for use against a wide range of targets rather than just one. \u201cRed buttons,\u201d says Mr Babbage, \u201cbecome rusty buttons.\u201d\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
