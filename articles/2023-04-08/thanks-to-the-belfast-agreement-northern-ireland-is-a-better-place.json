The former American senator had missed most of the first six months of his son\u2019s life in cajoling unionists and nationalists to reach a settlement. One day, he said, he wanted to sit with the boy in the public gallery of the Stormont Assembly, watching former enemies govern together. Fourteen years later he did just that. The ministerial statement they sat through was \u201cdry as dust\u201d, he said. \u201cBut it was music to my ears, and I thought it wonderful to hear.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "President Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak and other global leaders will soon be in Belfast, marking the deal\u2019s 25th anniversary on April 10th. There is much to celebrate. You can see the accord\u2019s traces in the city\u2019s very architecture: without the fear of bombs, there are glazed structures on nearly every street. You can taste them, too: where once a ring of steel kept out not only bombers but also diners, the Michelin guide recommends 18 restaurants. They have fostered friendship and even love. The Troubles forced people to stick largely to their own communities. Though most still live apart, many mix freely in the city centre."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The compromise that mostly ended 30 years of carnage has endured and even won over some who opposed it. Yet there are deep divisions still\u2014and there is none of Mitchell\u2019s music, but plenty of dust, in the assembly\u2019s walnut-panelled chamber. Devolved government has been in abeyance for over a year, after its sixth collapse in all. Civil servants are keeping health, education and other services running, but cannot change laws or policies. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The deal was an astonishing achievement. Some of those who struck it could barely speak to each other. David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, then the largest unionist party, did everything he could to avoid speaking directly to Gerry Adams of Sinn F\u00e9in, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), believing him to have been a key figure in the terrorist group. Mr Adams once tried to strike up conversation as they relieved themselves at the urinals. \u201cGrow up,\u201d Trimble growled."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Trimble led wary unionists to a generational compromise with nationalists, led by the avowedly non-violent John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), then the biggest on the nationalist side, whose thinking saturated the document. The two men would share the Nobel Peace Prize for their courage. Mr Adams showed courage of a different sort. Having failed to drive out the British at gunpoint, he oversaw the destruction of the IRA\u2019s arsenal, knowing he could be killed for doing so."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The agreement\u2019s genius lay in giving everyone just enough. Power-sharing between unionists and nationalists is compulsory. The leading party on one side provides the first minister and the other the deputy, and key votes in the assembly must be passed by majorities representing both. This protected the nationalist minority\u2019s interests, even while Northern Ireland remained British. The requirement to hold a referendum on uniting Ireland if there was evidence nationalists would win allowed Sinn F\u00e9in to say it had a political path to its goal (though Northern Ireland was always unviable without majority support). Cross-border bodies blurred a previously militarised frontier, even if unionists retained a veto over their actions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was enough for almost three-quarters of a population worn down by incessant atrocities. In referendums six weeks later 71% of voters in Northern Ireland and 94% in the Republic of Ireland voted for the agreement. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) furiously opposed the deal. Now it is the main unionist group, the DUP cites it in defence of its interests. One of the most controversial changes for unionists was the transformation of the old Royal Ulster Constabulary, which was only 8% Catholic, into the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which is 32% Catholic.
