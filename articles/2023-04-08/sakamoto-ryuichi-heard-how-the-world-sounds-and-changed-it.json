As a member of the Japanese techno-pop band Yellow Magic Orchestra, he helped pioneer modern electronic music. As a composer of epic film scores he enlivened the work of directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. In his later solo work, he grappled with mortality in haunting ambient soundscapes. His passing elicited tributes from musical luminaries around the world, testimony to the influence of his genre-spanning career. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Sakamoto was born in Tokyo in 1952 and took to music early. He graduated from one of Tokyo\u2019s top conservatories, where he studied Western classical music, becoming especially enamoured with Claude Debussy. There, he also explored an interest in the traditional music of Japan\u2019s Okinawa prefecture as well as in that of India and Africa. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Early in his career, Mr Sakamoto trained his ears on the sound of technology. Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), a group he formed in 1978 alongside Hosono Haruomi and Takahashi Yukihiro, used synthesisers in instrumental songs intended for dancing\u2014a novel combination at the time. \u201cErrors or noises absorb me and I wonder if new cultural currents could emerge from this deficiency,\u201d Mr Sakamoto said in \u201cTokyo Melody\u201d, a 1984 documentary about his experiments. That was exactly what happened: Mr Sakamoto\u2019s music helped inspire what would later become techno and hip-hop. His early work also presaged the bleeps and boops that became the soundscape of the modern digital world. (He would take a turn at composing some of those too, including ringtones for early Nokia mobile phones.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "YMO\u2019s success made Mr Sakamoto a star in Japan, leading to a role opposite David Bowie in Oshima Nagisa\u2019s 1983 film \u201cMerry Christmas, Mr Lawrence\u201d. Mr Sakamoto agreed to act in the movie on the condition that he could score it. His compositions, which blended melodic piano chords, sweeping synthesisers and Javanese gamelan, propelled him to global fame\u2014and established his bona fides as an artist who could bridge east and west. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cI want to break down the walls between genres, categories or cultures,\u201d he said many years later. He described his philosophy as \u201couternationalism\u201d. \u201cBeing outernational is like Moses in the desert. There\u2019s no country.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the second half of his career he turned towards the sound of nature. \u201cHe listened to the wind blowing and the water falling, he listened to the rocks moving and to the leaves fluttering, and he introduced those sounds\u2014consciously and subconsciously\u2014into his music,\u201d says Roger Pulvers, an author and film director.

Unusually for a Japanese musician, Mr Sakamoto used his fame to speak out on social and political issues, including environmental preservation and the oppression of Okinawans. Nuclear power was a particular bugbear. \u201cThey know nuclear power is unnecessary and dangerous,\u201d he railed in an interview in 2006, five years before an earthquake and tsunami rocked north-east Japan and triggered a nuclear meltdown in Fukushima. In the wake of the disaster, Mr Sakamoto travelled often to the region to support local residents. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2014 a first cancer diagnosis shook Mr Sakamoto\u2019s life. But even that could not mute his longing to hear more. The next year he composed the score for Mr I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s \u201cThe Revenant\u201d. Two years later he released \u201casync\u201d, an ambient album constructed around collages of poetry and music that was recorded partly on a water-damaged piano he found in a schoolhouse after the tsunami. In \u201cCoda\u201d, a documentary about Mr Sakamoto released the same year, he can be seen traversing the North Pole and dropping microphones underneath the ice. \u201cI\u2019m fishing the sound,\u201d he says, grinning at the camera, before declaring his catch \u201cthe purest I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d.\u25a0"}], "id": 15}
