This figure seems to be broadly confirmed by another survey, this time backed by USAID, America\u2019s aid agency, which found a fertility rate of 4.8 in 2021, down from 6.1 in 2010. \u201cSomething is happening,\u201d muses Argentina Matavel of the UN Population Fund.

Some point out that survey responses in Africa on desired family size have fallen little, though not all recent surveys ask that question. Other demographers reckon the data point to real changes. Still, many caution against comparing rates across different sorts of polls. Yet even comparing only within iterations of the same survey (as The Economist has done with the figures above), the trend is evident. Comparing across them in the case of Niger, which has the world\u2019s highest fertility rate but few surveys, shows a decline from 7.6 in 2012 to 6.2 in 2021."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Others are also reducing their projections. In 1972 the Club of Rome, a think-tank, published an influential book, \u201cThe Limits to Growth\u201d, warning that consumption and population growth would lead to economic collapse.

In Ethiopia, Kenya and Malawi, past plunges have been strongly associated with higher use of contraception, often thanks to big government pushes. In Malawi and Kenya well over half of married women use modern contraception such as the pill or injectables, while in Ethiopia about 40% do. The use of such methods is markedly lower in west Africa (see map), but improvements from a low base are probably part of the reason for the fertility drops. In Nigeria contraception use has gone from 11% to 18% in the past five years. In Senegal it has doubled to 26% in the past decade.

The Prophet Muhammad tacitly approved of the withdrawal method, he continues. These days Idris Sulaiman Abubakar, a gynaecologist in Kano\u2019s biggest public hospital, is more worried about the impact of Nigeria\u2019s film industry on contraception than that of religion. \u201cThey\u2019ll bring a story-line that the woman\u2019s reproductive system was damaged because she uses pills,\u201d he explains.

In Angola, for instance, women without any schooling have 7.8 children, whereas those with tertiary education have 2.3.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Research by Endale Kebede, Anne Goujon and Wolfgang Lutz of the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital suggests that a stall in Africa\u2019s demographic transition in the 2000s may have stemmed from the delayed effect of cuts in spending on education in the 1980s, when many African economies were in crisis. The rapid falls in fertility rates that now seem to be taking place could be because of the huge push to improve girls\u2019 schooling in the past few decades."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Economists tend to think that poor families have more children to ensure that some survive to look after their parents in old age.

In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni used to tell students: \u201cYour job is to produce children.\u201d Now he tells Ugandan women that lots of pregnancies will \u201cweaken your bodies and many children are not easy to manage and nurture.\u201d President Mohamed Bazoum of Niger made the \u201cfight on demography\u201d the core of his election campaign. In Nigeria, funding for family planning is low but President Muhammadu Buhari recently created a National Council on Population Management, underscoring \u201cthe urgency to address Nigeria\u2019s sustained high fertility rate, through expanding access to modern family planning\u201d.

That \u201cwe should have fewer Africans so we can drive polluting cars seems to me a really odd ethical position to take,\u201d points out David Canning of Harvard University.

For a start, Africa\u2019s population\u2014and therefore the world\u2019s\u2014would be considerably lower than most current projections. Take Nigeria. If the latest surveys are correct in finding that its fertility rate was 4.6 in 2021, this would suggest that it was already at a lower bound of the UN\u2019s estimates and on a much lower fertility trajectory than the UN\u2019s main forecast. Assuming Nigeria stays on the lower trajectory, then its population would get to about 342m people in 2060. That is some 90m people fewer than the UN\u2019s current base estimate and some 200m fewer than it forecast ten years ago.

In fact sub-Saharan Africa has an average of 48 people per square kilometre, which is far lower than Britain (277), Japan (346) or South Korea (531). Of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s five most populous countries, all are below Britain\u2019s density. There is little evidence of whole African countries being stuck in a Malthusian trap, named after Thomas Malthus, who claimed population growth would outstrip food supply, leading to catastrophe. Trade and global food production, which is rising while the amount of land used for it is falling, means that neither sub-regions nor even countries need be self-sufficient provided their economies produce the wealth to buy it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nor is it because high population growth necessarily means economic growth per head is low. \u201cIt\u2019s not very clear that we have the data to be able to say for sure that the population growth rate itself is bad or good,\u201d says Anne Bakilana of the World Bank. Richer places have fewer children and higher savings rates. But teasing out the causality is tricky."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What is clearer is that the transition from high population growth to a lower one can bring a bevy of benefits. Women and children are both more likely to prosper as fertility rates fall. Fertility drops usually mean wider gaps between births and fewer teenage pregnancies: both help reduce risks to a mother\u2019s health. And falling fertility rates mean there are more working-age adults relative to the number of children. With fewer mouths to feed at home, each child is more likely to get enough food, as well as books and uniforms for school. At the national level smaller cohorts could allow governments to spend more per child. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Falling fertility rates also excite economists because they boost both the working-age share of the population and the number of women in the workforce. More people working should boost prosperity. The faster fertility rates fall, the bigger the impact. A study in 2017 by Mahesh Karra and David Canning of Harvard University and Joshua Wilde of the University of South Florida estimates that lowering the fertility rate by one child per woman in Nigeria could almost double income per person by 2060. Yet for countries to reap a big dividend, those entering the job market need to be able to find productive jobs\u2014a monumental challenge in a continent that must invest trillions of dollars in the infrastructure (such as roads, power lines and ports) needed to generate them.
