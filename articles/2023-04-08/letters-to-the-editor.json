However, this is not a story of a failed health system. Rather it is a story of success driven by drug development and health care over the past 40 years. Premature mortality decreased from the 1990s to the 2010s, primarily because of improvements in cardiovascular treatment. This decrease plateaued in the 2010s, not because of a failure in medicine and social structures, but because, given patient adherence levels, maximum efficiency was reached."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The reduction in child mortality over the four decades to the 2010s can be explained mostly by improved road safety, suffocation risk-reduction measures (inhalation holes in plastic bags, pen lids and toys), and leaps forward in the treatment of haematological cancers and childhood neoplasms more broadly. Medical science continues to reduce childhood mortality and will cut deaths from disease in children to below the figure of seven per 100,000 in Britain in 2020."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Modern medicine is not a panacea.

People work longer, spend more, volunteer and provide care. In countries such as Canada, where 6% of health spending goes on prevention, there are lasting and significant impacts. Across the G20, increasing preventative health spending by just 0.1% could unlock a 9% increase in annual spending by people aged 60 and over. We are at risk of heading in the wrong direction. In Britain spending to help people stop smoking has been reduced, yet fewer smoking-related diseases would boost the British economy by as much as \u00a319bn ($23bn) a year. There is a clear economic argument as well as a moral one for committing to longer lives for all."}, {"role": "body", "text": "David SinclairChief executiveInternational Longevity CentreLondon"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230218_BRP501.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 720.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "second", "text": "Future of the Chagos Islands"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Simon Jackson wonders why Mauritius is keen to obtain the Chagos Islands (Letters, March 18th).

As you point out, many banks hold mark-to-market losses as a result of rising interest rates. The new facility puts a floor on those losses for up to a year by lending at par values, in effect providing amnesty to banks with sufficient Treasury holdings.

There are thousands of businesses that do not treat their workers properly. Many workers don\u2019t have the appropriate protective gear, or are under age or live on site in poor conditions.
