In November 1995 Bill Clinton stood near the historic walls of Derry\u2014Londonderry to its Protestants\u2014and uttered a sequence of sonorous lines by Seamus Heaney, a local poet and dramatist who had just won the Nobel prize: \u201cOnce in a lifetime/The longed-for tidal wave/Of justice can rise up/And hope and history rhyme.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whatever the hopes fulfilled or dashed in the 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement\u2014signed on April 10th 1998\u2014the cultural life of this once-benighted land has blossomed, often in unexpected ways, and especially in film and drama. World-famous actors who had fled the region\u2019s mayhem have reclaimed their roots; locally based creative types are earning global acclaim. But the sad part is that in the performing arts, just as in politics and daily life, the deep intercommunal division at the heart of the Troubles, which erupted in 1969 and cost more than 3,500 lives, shows no sign of melting away."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even now, most representations of Northern Irish life, whether funny, sad or (as is often the case) both, are firmly rooted in one community or the other: among Irish nationalists who are mostly Catholic, or pro-British Unionists or loyalists, whose background is Protestant. For instance, Sir Kenneth Branagh, a star of the stage and screen, returned to his own beginnings in the loyalist proletariat to make \u201cBelfast\u201d. Released in 2021, the film focuses on a working-class Protestant family, traumatised as much by their community\u2019s role in the burning of Catholic homes as by their own collective suffering.

It portrays two quarrelsome brothers on a desolate family farm, one of whom has Down\u2019s syndrome, who horse about with their mother\u2019s ashes. For its part, \u201cDerry Girls\u201d, a hit television series about lippy female adolescents in the early 1990s, has some side-splitting moments involving awkward Protestant-Catholic encounters. But most of the action is set deep inside a Catholic scene where\u2014as in real-life Derry\u2014piety and bawdiness can be strangely juxtaposed. (In works such as \u201cThe Exodus\u201d, a local playwright, Jonathan Burgess, has told the lesser-known story of Protestants who were intimidated out of homes in the same city, over on the west bank of the River Foyle.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This bifurcation reflects Northern Ireland\u2019s wider pattern of peaceable but largely separate coexistence. Oddly enough, the work that challenges sectarian divisions most directly does so by appearing to be weirdly, surreally obsessed by them: a comedy called \u201cGive My Head Peace\u201d that began as a TV sitcom and became a touring stage show. It features screamingly caricatured Protestants and Catholics in perpetual and often improbable interaction with one another, ranging from the banteringly social to the conspiratorial and the erotic."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The lead character is a grumpy, lecherous old Irish republican called, simply, Da. He is played and was created by Tim McGarry, a prolific comedy writer and veteran of the legal profession who grew up amid the horrors of religiously divided north Belfast in the 1970s. Like any Northern Irish person of around 60, Mr McGarry has memories that are both dark and farcical. The son of a Catholic surgeon, he recalls the Protestant gang that tried to burn his family home but could not, to judge by a scribbled slogan, spell the name of their own religion correctly."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whereas \u201cDerry Girls\u201d is safely set in the recent past, \u201cGive My Head Peace\u201d does its best to remain topical. In the latest stage version, which has played to packed houses in 14 venues across the north of Ireland, Da makes his loyalist friends furiously jealous by brandishing an invitation to the coronation of King Charles. The cast includes a fire-breathing, trigger-happy Protestant cleric called Pastor Begbie\u2014played, as it happens, by the actor Paddy Jenkins, who appears as a Catholic priest in \u201cAn Irish Goodbye\u201d. (Devotion to the stage show, which was being performed in the small town of Downpatrick, meant Mr Jenkins missed the Oscars ceremony.)"}, {"role": "second", "text": "A laughing matter"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The comedy was first commissioned by the BBC in 1998. But it hasn\u2019t dated, Mr McGarry maintains: \u201cIn a place where most schools and neighbourhoods remain segregated, and most people vote in accordance with their religious background, it\u2019s still topical to say sectarianism is stupid.\u201d Away from the stage he makes that point by campaigning for mixed-community schools and supporting the humanist movement."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For another attempt to laugh sectarianism out of existence, turn to the Dundonald Liberation Army (dla), consisting of two amiably boneheaded warriors bent on freeing the Belfast suburb of Dundonald from the nearby town of Lisburn (into which, in real life, it has been incorporated). Having built up a big following on Facebook, the doughty guerrillas will make their third appearance on the Belfast stage in June. The DLA\u2019s commander is played by Matthew McElhinney, an energetic young actor-director whose many contributions to Belfast theatre have included a turn in \u201cThree\u2019s a Shroud\u201d, a hilarious skit on Catholic and Protestant undertakers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The DLA\u2019s style\u2014bling, fake tan, ostentatious facial hair\u2014is unmistakably that of loyalist criminal godfathers. Their performances have attracted working-class Protestant men who might not normally be theatre-goers. Yet at times the dotty rhetoric is reminiscent of Irish nationalism. Stephen Large, creator of both the DLA and \u201cThree\u2019s a Shroud\u201d, insists he is an \u201cequal-opportunity offender\u201d, who tries to show proper disrespect for all sides."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile, on Derry\u2019s storied walls, which loom large in Protestant memory because of a Catholic siege in 1689, the balance teeters between hope and historical obsession. This year an Anglican cleric\u2014working with Mr Burgess, the playwright, who is Presbyterian\u2014is using the fortifications to stage an Easter passion play.
