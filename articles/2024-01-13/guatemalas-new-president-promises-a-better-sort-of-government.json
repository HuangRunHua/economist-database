The likes of Costa Rica and Panama have real if messy democracies. Nicaragua suffers under Daniel Ortega, a dictator, and El Salvador is becoming more autocratic under a populist strongman, Nayib Bukele. Honduras and Guatemala have been deeply corrupt. Hence the enthusiasm for Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo, a bona fide democrat, who is to be sworn in as Guatemala\u2019s president on January 14th."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A 65-year-old former academic and ambassador to Spain, Mr Ar\u00e9valo pledges to restore democracy, which has long been ailing in Central America\u2019s most populous country. Mr Ar\u00e9valo and his party, Semilla, have made a range of promises that broadly fall into two baskets: cleaning up the state to make it more democratic and inclusive; and improving services, such as education, health care and infrastructure. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many pundits hope that Guatemala can set a new trend, in contrast to the likes of Mr Bukele, who is easily Latin America\u2019s most popular politician and role model. Mr Ar\u00e9valo has had an outpouring of support, both at home and abroad. Civil society, led by the country\u2019s large indigenous population, took to the streets in the face of attempts by a political, military and judicial cabal known as \u201cthe pact of the corrupt\u201d to stop Mr Ar\u00e9valo from taking office. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "To prove himself Mr Ar\u00e9valo will need to \u201cgo beyond good intentions\u201d, says Edgar Gut\u00ederrez, a former foreign minister. \u201cOur objective is to make the democratic model sufficiently attractive,\u201d says Samuel P\u00e9rez, a Semilla lawmaker. \u201cThat means results to improve people\u2019s lives.\u201d But within his party some disagree over how much to compromise its ideals to get things done."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Ar\u00e9valo will have to be pragmatic. Semilla won only 23 of 160 seats in Congress and will eschew corrupt practices of the past, such as handing lucrative contracts to its supporters. \u00c1lvaro Arz\u00fa, an opposition congressman, says there is room for negotiation to pass laws, for instance on health services. But many lawmakers will refuse to co-operate. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Things in Guatemala are so dire that even small changes should make a difference. \u201cThink filling in potholes rather than building a double-decker road,\u201d suggests Edgar Ortiz of the Liberty and Development Foundation, a local think-tank. Alejandro Giammattei, the departing president, has strengthened presidential power, so Mr Ar\u00e9valo can lean on executive fiat. He may need to be showy. Mr P\u00e9rez points to the popularity of a new library in El Salvador\u2014paid for by China. Such things get noticed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Ar\u00e9valo is unlikely to match Mr Bukele\u2019s popularity. His win in Guatemala was \u201ca glitch in the matrix\u201d, says Mr Ortiz. He was lucky in the second-round vote to run against a candidate who had failed in three previous bids. The United States\u2019 support may be limited to anti-corruption. Mobilising the street will be harder once in office. \u201cWe are not 100% behind Ar\u00e9valo,\u201c says Luis Pacheco, an indigenous leader. \u201cThe idea was to defend our democracy and elections.\u201d Lester Ram\u00edrez, a Honduran researcher, says: \u201cGuatemala\u2019s democratic resilience is impressive. But there\u2019s a social fatigue after the vote.\u201d He reckons that people see election day as the moment to embrace democracy. But afterwards they just want results, however achieved, and thus often prefer a strongman.\u25a0"}], "id": 33}
