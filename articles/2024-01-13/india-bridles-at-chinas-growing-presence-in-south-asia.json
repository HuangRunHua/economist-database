Yet recent days have seen an unusual public debate about which beaches are acceptable and which, more to the point, are not. Politicians and Bollywood stars are richly praising India\u2019s own island and coastal resorts. They are meanwhile urging people not to travel across the Indian Ocean to a traditionally hankered-after alternative: the Maldives. Some travel agents have stopped taking bookings to the archipelagic South Asian state."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What is afoot? Earlier this month Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, paid a visit to the union territory of Lakshadweep, a tropical archipelago off the coast of the southern state of Kerala. Mr Modi praised the islands\u2019 tourism potential and was pictured snorkelling against a backdrop of pristine\u2014distinctly Maldives-like\u2014white sands. This prompted three junior Maldivian ministers to take to social media with snarky comments about India\u2019s supposedly inferior beaches and its prime minister. That angered Indian social-media users, who rallied to Lakshadweep\u2019s and Mr Modi\u2019s defence, and India\u2019s government, which summoned the Maldives\u2019 envoy in Delhi for a ticking-off. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Besides highlighting the nationalist mood in India, the saga points to a growing strain in the long and historically close relationship between India and the Maldives, which is home to 400,000 people. It is symptomatic of the wider difficulties India faces in managing its neighbourhood as China\u2019s influence in South Asia grows. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "India and the Maldives have a long history of co-operation on economic, defence and security issues, having established diplomatic relations after the Maldives gained its independence from Britain in 1965. Nearly 210,000 Indian visitors entered the Maldives last year, more than from any other country, representing more than 11% of total arrivals. A prolonged Indian boycott could seriously hurt the Maldives\u2019 economy, a third of which relies on tourism. The Maldives\u2019 government was therefore quick to try to contain the spat. On January 7th the three snarky ministers were suspended. On January 9th the Maldives\u2019 tourism association implored Indian travel agents to end their boycott."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At first glance, the swift suspension of the three ministers looks like a victory for India, its angry social-media warriors and Mr Modi. \u201cThere is a sense of \u2018look what happens to a Mickey Mouse country that misbehaves with India\u2019,\u201d says Happymon Jacob of Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. Yet that would be short-sighted\u2014not least because the offending politicians\u2019 comments will have been popular with many Maldivians. As is the case with Nepal and Bhutan to the north-east, the Maldives\u2019 relationship with India has grown more complex over the past decade as China has extended its influence in South Asia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2014 the Maldives joined China\u2019s Maritime Silk Road Initiative; three years later the two countries signed a free-trade agreement. A deal in 2017 to set up a joint ocean-observation station with China caused security concerns in India\u2014especially after the deal encouraged some Maldivians to demand that India withdraw the few dozen soldiers, manning helicopters, that it stations in the archipelago."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In November Mohamed Muizzu, the Maldives\u2019 newly elected president, renewed the call for the Indian troops to leave. On January 8th he embarked on a five-day visit to China, including a meeting with President Xi Jinping in Beijing. During the visit Mr Muizzu, who has not travelled to India since taking office, called on China to send more tourists to the Maldives than to any other country."}, {"role": "body", "text": "India needs to respond thoughtfully to China\u2019s growing role in its near-abroad. Above all, suggests Mr Jacob, \u201ca responsible aspiring great power should ask itself how to build a more successful partnership with a smaller neighbour.\u201d That could help improve India\u2019s standing in its neighbourhood. It might also benefit fragile local ecosystems. The calls to boycott the Maldives are now increasingly being countered by equally impassioned calls to save Lakshadweep from overtourism. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of our India coverage by signing up to Essential India, our free weekly newsletter."}], "id": 13}
