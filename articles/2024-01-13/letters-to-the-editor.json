However, the policy put the government in the awkward position of policing speech and thus contained an inherent conflict with the constitution\u2019s First Amendment. The FCC under Reagan used this argument of unconstitutionality to repeal the doctrine in 1987.

But even Mr Kahneman\u2019s work does not aim to study irrationality. It aims to identify the heuristics that people use when making judgments. In Herbert Simon\u2019s terms, the use of heuristics is procedurally rational because it allows optimal use of limited resources. Occasionally, their use may result in substantively irrational outcomes (biases) that illuminate the nature of the heuristics employed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It can be difficult to define substantive rationality. To use your forecasting example, consider points randomly scattered around a linear trend line. To a statistician, it is rational to make forecasts on that trend line. To a forecaster, who knows that nothing continues on such a trajectory for ever, it is rational to use this real-world knowledge to damp the trend when making forecasts. This is what people do when using judgment to make forecasts; they forecast below upward trend lines and above downward ones. What initially appears to be biased judgment, may not be.
