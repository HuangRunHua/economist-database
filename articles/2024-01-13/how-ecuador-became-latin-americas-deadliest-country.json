Some Ecuadorean sources estimate that by 2023 the homicide rate had grown more than six-fold, to 45 per 100,000. This would make Ecuador the deadliest country in mainland Latin America. Its gangsters have adopted spectacularly gory tactics, including public hangings, decapitations and immolation.

Guards at La Regional prison in Guayaquil, Ecuador\u2019s largest city, discovered that Adolfo Mac\u00edas, boss of Los Choneros, a drug gang, was not in his cell. He had been serving a 34-year sentence for murder and drug-trafficking. Gang members in prisons across the country began rioting as news of his escape spread. Videos circulated on social media of gangsters taking prison guards hostage and shooting them. Some guards were hanged. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The next day Daniel Noboa, Ecuador\u2019s president, declared a state of emergency that is set to last until early March, and imposed a nightly curfew. He sent the army in to take control of the prisons, from which many gangs direct operations. Gangsters fought back on the streets of cities across Ecuador, detonating bombs, burning cars and kidnapping policemen. On the same day that hooded men stormed TC Televisi\u00f3n, another armed group raided Guayaquil University, taking students hostage and exchanging fire with police. Mr Noboa responded on January 9th by declaring an \u201cinternal armed conflict\u201d and ordering the army to \u201cneutralise\u201d some 22 organised crime groups, including Los Choneros.

Ecuador, and particularly the port at Guayaquil, became a more important hub by which Peruvian and Colombian cocaine is moved to the United States and Europe after Colombian ports tightened their security in 2009. Trade had previously been monopolised by the FARC, a powerful Colombian guerrilla group, which kept violence to a minimum. But when the FARC signed a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016, most of its members demobilised. Local, regional and international gangs have poured in to fill the power vacuum. Mexican gangs funded Ecuadorean ones. The Albanian ma\ufb01a expanded its presence in Ecuador. A rapid influx of international organised crime was facilitated by Ecuador\u2019s dollarised economy, and lax visa requirements for foreigners (until 2020). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Politicians have made things worse. In the name of anti-imperialism Rafael Correa, a populist left-wing president who ruled from 2007 to 2017, closed an American military base on the coast, reduced co-operation with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and broke up an elite anti-narcotics police unit which had been trained by the United States\u2019 agents. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Small-time Ecuadorean gangsters like Mr Mac\u00edas have become kingpins. Los Choneros seems to have gained first-mover advantage by being one of the earliest Ecuadorean groups to establish relations with Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa gang. It and other local gangs are thought to have armed themselves with weapons obtained from their Mexican patrons in exchange for cocaine shipments. They now possess machineguns, rifles and grenades that allow them to take on Ecuador\u2019s poorly trained armed forces."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ecuadorean gangs have generated cashflow by establishing a lucrative foothold in Europe, where cocaine consumption is expanding. On January 5th the mayor of Amsterdam warned that the Netherlands could become a \u201cnarco-state\u201d. The busiest cocaine-trafficking route in the world today runs from Guayaquil to the port of Antwerp in Belgium, according to Chris Dalby of World of Crime, an investigative outfit based in the Netherlands. Much of this cocaine is packed in shipping containers containing bananas, one of Ecuador\u2019s biggest exports. Europe\u2019s demand \u201chas turned Ecuadorean ports into one of the most valuable pieces of infrastructure you can control if you are a drug-trafficking group in Latin America,\u201d says Will Freeman of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That helps gangs buy off prison guards. Mr Mac\u00edas and other gang leaders have turned perhaps a quarter of Ecuador\u2019s 36 prisons into their headquarters, from which they organise attacks and recruit new members. Mr Mac\u00edas escaped just before he was due to be transferred to a more secure unit in the prison complex. He must have been tipped o\ufb00 by corrupt o\ufb03cials."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Corruption of that sort is rife. In 2023 police began investigating several government officials for links with the Albanian mafia. Months later, the main suspect was found dead. In 2022 25 air-force officials were punished for sabotaging radar equipment that was monitoring the activity of drug gangs in Ecuadorean airspace. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Anyone who stands up to the drug gangs and their corrupt networks is at risk. Last August Fernando Villavicencio, a presidential candidate and former investigative journalist, was assassinated 11 days before the election after he threatened to take down the gangs. On January 5th Fabricio Col\u00f3n Pico, a leader of Los Lobos, a rival gang to Los Choneros, was arrested for allegedly plotting to assassinate Diana Salazar, the attorney-general. Ms Salazar had been investigating links between drug-traffickers and bureaucrats. In December she ordered the arrest of 31 people, including judges, prosecutors, police officers and the president of the Judiciary Council. Mr Col\u00f3n Pico managed to escape from jail just four days after his arrest. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "After campaigning on less controversial issues, Mr Noboa, who took o\ufb03ce in November, has taken an iron \ufb01st to the gangs. He has announced that two new maximum security prisons will be built; declared gangs to be terrorist organisations; and warned that o\ufb03cials who collaborate with them will be brought to justice. Like his predecessor, he is sending the army onto the streets and into the prisons. And he has called for a referendum in coming weeks that would legalise extradition and enable the assets of suspected criminals to be seized."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some of these tactics appear to copy those of Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, who has put some 2% of the adult population behind bars and become one of the most popular presidents in the world in the process. Yet the challenges faced by the two leaders are di\ufb00erent. The Ecuadorean gangs are far more sophisticated than those in El Salvador. And Mr Noboa, who must seek re-election in 18 months, is far weaker than Mr Bukele. Despite Mr Bukele\u2019s success so far, the strongman approach to Latin American drug gangs has usually failed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Noboa must make a cleverer plan. He should urge his o\ufb03cials to share data with counterparts elsewhere in the region, which does not happen at the moment, says Mr Dalby. He should set up a register of guns, rebuild the country\u2019s feeble anti-narcotics units and strengthen co-operation with the United States, which has offered to help. And he must bolster the state\u2019s presence along the border with Colombia and in Guayaquil. Without all this, going to war with Ecuador\u2019s newly empowered gangs is likely to prove futile. \u25a0"}], "id": 31}
