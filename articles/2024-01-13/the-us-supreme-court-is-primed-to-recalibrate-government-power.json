The power of some 436 federal agencies that do the bulk of the work of the federal government\u2014from food safety to banking rules to pollution control\u2014comes under the justices\u2019 scrutiny on January 17th.

Space on these vessels is a \u201cscarce and precious resource\u201d, the fisheries\u2019 lawyer argues, making the NMFS\u2019s rule (which was suspended in April 2023) an \u201cenormous imposition\u201d.

In allowing the agency to impose the regulation, three-judge panels on both courts turned to a Supreme Court decision, Chevron USA v Natural Resources Defence Council, that has managed the inter-branch balance of power since 1984. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chevron has two steps. First, judges determine if a law governing an administrative agency speaks clearly. If it does, judges interpret it themselves and tell the agencies what the law means. But if judges believe the law is ambiguous, they give bureaucrats the benefit of the doubt. At this second step, if the court sees the agency\u2019s interpretation as reasonable\u2014even if it is not the interpretation the court thinks best\u2014it defers to the agency. In Loper Bright and Relentless, the circuit courts concluded that the law in question is ambiguous and that the NMFS\u2019s interpretation of it is reasonable. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chevron was popular among conservative justices in its early days. Five years after it was decided, Antonin Scalia (an arch-conservative justice who died in 2016) gave a lecture at Duke Law School in which he predicted that agency deference would endure as it \u201creflects the reality of government\u201d and \u201cserves its needs\u201d. Yet two justices on the court today\u2014Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas\u2014have made clear their deep disdain for what has become known as \u201cChevron deference\u201d.

It may be a good bet. Brett Kavanaugh, two years before he became a justice, raised critical questions about Chevron in an article in the Harvard Law Review. The conservative majority has not invoked Chevron since 2016. The plaintiffs write that the doctrine has been \u201cthe-case-which-must-not-be-named\u201d at the high court for years; the conservative court may see this as the moment to give Chevron, as Justice Gorsuch put it in 2022, \u201ca tombstone no one can miss\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dozens of friend-of-the-court briefs urge the justices to do just that: bury-Chevron filings outnumber save-Chevron briefs by a ratio of four to one.

Federal agencies, staffed by some 2.2m civil servants with expertise that judges often lack, protect workplace safety and respond to natural disasters. They keep aeroplanes and financial markets aloft. The government warns that abandoning Chevron\u2014which lower courts continue to rely on even as the Supreme Court has quietly ignored it\u2014would \u201cthreaten settled expectations in virtually every area of conduct regulated by federal law\u201d. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 21}
