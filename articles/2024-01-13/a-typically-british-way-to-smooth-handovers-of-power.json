The idea is to make handovers of power smoother, especially when there is no formal transition period. In Britain, which takes exception to anything so dull as a written constitution, there is instead an awkward dance of hesitant approaches and furtive exchanges.

Official minutes record that the then prime minister, Alec Douglas-Home, approved them on three conditions. They had to be \u201cdiscreet\u201d; they had to be conducted \u201con a factual basis\u201d; and, above all, the prime minister had to \u201cknow nothing whatsoever\u201d about them (despite already knowing about them).

For a prime minister, the risk was that being seen to connive with the opposition damaged morale within his party. Opposition leaders fretted about appearing presumptuous. Everyone could at least agree that discretion was essential. As one private secretary opined: \u201cThis really is the opposite of \u2018justice\u2019: it perhaps ought to be done but it certainly mustn\u2019t be seen.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That means lots of cloak-and-dagger arrangements. In 1996 Tony Blair summoned a succession of Sir Humphreys to a borrowed town house in Notting Hill. It also leaves room for petulance. Harold Wilson, a Labour prime minister, was accused of not sticking to the \u201crules\u201d; after grudgingly allowing access talks before the election in 1970, he neurotically sought to track all contact between the civil service and the Tories.

But if talks don\u2019t start soon, warns Catherine Haddon of the Institute for Government, a think-tank, his team could find itself ill-prepared for office. Much silliness could be avoided, she says, if a prime minister agreed to clearer rules or let the top civil servant oversee things.
