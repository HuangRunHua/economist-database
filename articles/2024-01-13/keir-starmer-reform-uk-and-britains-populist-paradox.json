"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Call it Britain\u2019s populist paradox. Across Europe\u2014in Austria, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands\u2014radical-right parties are in fine fettle. Many draw inspiration from Donald Trump, who has a remarkably good shot of returning to the White House. Britain is on a different trajectory. A Conservative Party which has often echoed the policies, rhetoric and tropes of what academics call \u201cnational populism\u201d is on course for an electoral defeat, and possibly a calamitous one. Instead, the country is likely to elect Labour under Sir Keir, a stiff social democrat who offers a worthy recipe of restored institutions, fiscal rectitude, diligent public service and healed social divisions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is a puzzle. Forces that feed the radical right\u2014depressed living standards, high immigration and mistrust of elites\u2014proliferate in Britain. Real wages will be no higher by the end of the year than they were in 2006, according to a paper by the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, published in December. Britons voted to limit migration in the Brexit referendum of 2016; instead it has surged, to a net 745,000 in 2022. Just 9% of Britons say they trust politicians to tell the truth, according to Ipsos, a pollster; that is the lowest score since it began asking the question in 1983. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This sounds like fertile ground for Reform UK, a right-wing outfit co-founded by Nigel Farage (and formerly known as the Brexit Party), that is led by Richard Tice, an ex-property developer. Reform UK has seen an uptick in the polls, to 11%, according to The Economist\u2019s poll tracker. But it is part of a fight between conservative elites for the future of the right rather than a popular movement that slices through established party lines, as Brexit and Mr Trump did. It draws almost entirely from Tory ranks: some 20% of the Conservatives\u2019 2019 voters say they will support Reform, against just 2% of Labour\u2019s. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Tice has cast his outfit in neo-Thatcherite colours: he denounces the governing \u201cConsocialists\u201d and calls for deep cuts to tax, government spending and regulation to stimulate Britain\u2019s sluggish economy. The aim is to exploit the gulf between the Conservative Party\u2019s self-image as the party of low taxes and low immigration and its record in office. Mr Sunak\u2019s warnings that Mr Tice will only help the Labour Party are met by Reformers with a shrug: splitting the right is the point. They hope the Tories suffer an electoral calamity, the worse the better, and then split between moderates and right-wingers. Reform UK would then challenge the rump party to be the true voice of British conservatism. The next election \u201cwill be a punishment-beating from which they can\u2019t come back in their current form\u201d, says one party figure."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is not a strategy with mass appeal. Whereas the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which Mr Farage once led, routinely polled second place in by-elections in the years before the EU referendum, Reform UK has not met the 5% threshold to keep its deposit in ten of the 11 contests it has entered since 2022. The reason is largely its small-state agenda\u2014a return to UKIP\u2019s fusty roots, which Mr Farage had to disguise as he wooed working-class voters in poor towns who wanted higher spending. (Reform UK\u2019s stint as a lockdown-sceptic outfit flopped among an electorate that rather liked the slap of the covid-19 state.) For now Reform UK looks more like a virtual movement than a popular one: it has a scant presence on local councils and Mr Tice relies on regular slots on Talk TV and GB News, right-leaning channels that are increasingly influential among conservatives. This will change only if Mr Farage\u2014who can still pack out pubs and theatres\u2014returns to the front line.

Leaders are shaped by what preceded them: Sir Tony Blair by Thatcherism, David Cameron by Blairism and Sir Keir by the Brexit years. His party is refitted around what Labour wonks term \u201chero voters\u201d\u2014the older, white working classes in Brexit-leaning seats. Labour is now sceptical of globalisation; it venerates blue-collar work over white-collar jobs; it is authoritarian on crime; it denounces Westminster as endemically self-interested and sleazy. Sir Keir\u2019s speeches are peppered with words like class, family, work, respect, security, resilience, duty, service and country. (Absent: equality, freedom, openness.) Whenever he talks of Brexit, he sounds rather like Charles de Gaulle addressing the French Algerians: \u201cJe vous ai compris.\u201c "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sir Keir\u2019s promise of yoga-class politics is also astute. The problem with populism and nationalism, Sir Keir said in his speech, is that \u201cit needs your full attention. It needs you constantly focusing on this week\u2019s common enemy. And that\u2019s exhausting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d His promise for a politics that \u201ctreads a little lighter on all of our lives\u201d sounds like a repudiation of the past decade. But it also harnesses the desire for security and a more parochial politics. Recall that the Vote Leave campaign pitched Brexit not as a risky adventure but as \u201cthe safer option\u201d than staying in a crisis-ridden EU, and as a means to get more money for the National Health Service. Note how, three years later, Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d was sold not as a continuation of the constitutional battle but as a way for bored voters to \u201cend the argument, stop the chaos\u201d and hire more nurses and police officers. Sir Keir\u2019s post-populist pitch is a bet that British voters want to hear less from their politicians and to see more of their doctors.
