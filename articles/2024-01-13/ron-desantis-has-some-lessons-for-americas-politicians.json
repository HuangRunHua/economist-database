Amid the huffing and puffing, a mischievous, even puncturing note can also be heard: Mr Trump, as God\u2019s chosen agent, will not only \u201cfight the Marxists\u201d but also pause to \u201ceat supper\u201d. After taming the \u201ccantankerous\u201d World Economic Forum, the gravelly voice deadpans, Mr Trump might \u201ccome home hungry\u201d yet he will wait \u201cuntil the First Lady is done with lunch with friends\u2014then tell the ladies to be sure and come back real soon\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump was aggrandising himself, but he was also once again making fun of poor beleaguered Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, aka, to Mr Trump, \u201cRon DeSanctus\u201d, aka \u201cDeSaster\u201d, aka \u201cTiny D\u201d. More than a year ago, Tiny D\u2019s\u2014ahem, Mr DeSantis\u2019s\u2014wife, Casey DeSantis, tweeted a video in which another thunderous male voice also described God looking down on \u201chis planned paradise\u201d. In that instance, God chose to create \u201ca fighter\u201d. Noble black-and-white images of Mr DeSantis illustrated baritone blather about defending what is \u201cright and just\u201d, without the slightest hint of irony. Solemn as it was, Mr DeSantis\u2019s video was far sillier than the one Mr Trump celebrated. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Mr DeSantis was riding high back then, before he challenged Mr Trump for the Republican nomination. Just days after that tweet, as Republicans across the country struggled in midterm elections, Mr DeSantis was re-elected by 19 points. The New York Post proclaimed him \u201cDeFuture\u201d: he had Mr Trump\u2019s policy aims but not his baggage, his forcefulness but not his fecklessness, his killer ways but not his loser record. He was a college athlete, a navy veteran, a former prosecutor and congressman as well as a serving governor. And he was just 44, with a media-savvy wife and three children. He looked like a winner. On paper. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr DeSantis may yet produce a surprise in the Iowa caucus on January 15th. His aides boast of their assiduous door-knocking. But polls show him struggling to cling to a distant second place behind Mr Trump. Mr DeSantis may never have had much chance of keeping his early mojo, particularly once Mr Trump\u2019s indictments rallied Republicans to the former president. Yet lessons can be learned from his experience; not only by Mr DeSantis as his campaign moves ahead, but by future DeFutures and the donors who will be tempted to fall in love with them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr DeSantis\u2019s first mistake was to alienate the aide who revived his first campaign for governor, Susie Wiles. He wound up pushing a formidable operative who knew his every weakness into Mr Trump\u2019s camp, where she is now a top adviser. Then he delayed entering the race for months, calculating that a productive state-legislative session would buttress his campaign but exposing himself to a classic Trumpist bombardment\u2014from the left (for voting to cut entitlements), from the right (for wanting to raise taxes) and out of left field (for eating pudding with his fingers). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr DeSantis attempted an unconventional campaign launch on Twitter, but it proved a carnival of glitches that mocked his image of competence. Perhaps most damaging, he conducted another radical experiment by outsourcing key decisions to a Super PAC, Never Back Down, which he and his campaign could not legally control. It burned through tens of millions of dollars until, last month, it backed down, with officials resigning or being fired after anonymous finger-pointing over bad decisions. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The most basic political lesson of the DeSantis campaign, but the hardest to apply, is this: you can never tell. Recall, just since the 2016 campaign, such candidates as Rick Perry of Texas, Scott Walker of Wisconsin, John Kasich of Ohio, Jeb Bush of Florida, Chris Christie of New Jersey, and even Doug Burgum of North Dakota\u2014they all looked good on paper, too. They were all accomplished serving or former Republican governors, a species of candidate with particular appeal to the mandarin class. In any era their candidacies may not have survived contact with national politics, but they certainly could not thrive in the Republican reality defined by Mr Trump\u2019s sulphurous tactics and charisma."}, {"role": "body", "text": "You also cannot tell in advance because some candidates learn quickly, and others do not. Mr DeSantis has improved as a candidate, but not as much as, say, Barack Obama had by this point. Having tried for too long to duck combat with Mr Trump, Mr DeSantis has honed his own criticisms. He shows a bit of interest, sometimes, beyond mechanically asking a voter\u2019s name. His voice has acquired inflection beyond the aggrieved whine that sliced through many of his debate appearances. His smile sometimes crinkles his eyes, rather than just exposing his clenched teeth."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Another Ron"}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Mr DeSantis remains God\u2019s fighter, a belligerent candidate unlike the Republican governors of the past 50 years who did go on to win the nomination\u2014Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Mitt Romney. Mr DeSantis\u2019s glower has made him a natural foil for Mr Trump. Compared with the politician of 2016, Mr Trump is himself a darker candidate. But he has delighted in playing the Road Runner to Mr DeSantis\u2019s flummoxed Coyote, Bugs Bunny to his plodding Elmer Fudd. \u201cThere\u2019s another version of Ron DeSantis where he really celebrates the American dream,\u201d says Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant who advised Mr Romney and Mr Bush, among others. \u201cHe\u2019s a middle-class guy from Florida, went to Harvard, Yale: \u2018I represent what is possible in America, and I want to make it possible for everyone.\u2019 You would have liked that guy.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump is now training his fire on a more adept politician, Nikki Haley. She was also a governor, of South Carolina. She has run a better campaign than Mr DeSantis and offered a sunnier contrast to Mr Trump.
