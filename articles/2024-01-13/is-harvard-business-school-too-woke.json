Following the resignation of Claudine Gay as president of Harvard University on January 2nd, her interim replacement said he could not recall \u201ca period of comparable tension\u201d at the institution. Ms Gay was ousted after a plagiarism scandal erupted over her academic work. But her position had been precarious for months; some donors were upset that she seemed to tolerate students\u2019 antisemitic outbursts. For conservatives, Ms Gay, who was Harvard\u2019s first black and second female president, was also a symbol of liberal elites\u2019 fixation on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The ostensibly hard-headed sorts who attend Harvard\u2019s management school, and that school\u2019s ties to harder-headed corporate America, might be expected to insulate it from wider campus convulsions. Not quite. Businesses too are facing a DEI reckoning. As a consequence, Harvard Business School (HBS) is facing pressure on two fronts."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Students at HBS are the holders of the winning tickets in the lottery of American capitalism. On average, they arrive with five years of work experience, nearly half of them from prestigious consulting or financial firms. Two years of study for the 115-year-old institution\u2019s MBA degree all but guarantee a comfortable professional perch. Some do much better still. The fortunes of HBS alumni have helped build the school\u2019s reputation and, thanks to their generous donations, stock its coffers (combined with annual income from MBA tuition fees, executive education, a publishing business and online courses, in 2022 the school made $966m in revenue)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After the murder of George Floyd, a black man, by a police officer in May 2020 HBS underwent a self-examination typical of other American institutions at the time. \u201cWhat we could agree on is that the experience of black students at the school, as they reported upon graduation, was not quite the same as white students\u2019. There was a deficit,\u201d says Robert Kaplan, a faculty member involved in the review. HBS\u2019s approach to DEI has since resembled that of corporate America\u2014and of the rest of Harvard. In 2021 it hired a chief diversity-and-inclusion officer and tried to increase the diversity of the student body and faculty."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bringing DEI into the business-school classroom has been more controversial. Compared with the rest of the university, HBS faculty are probably less woke. The pressure for more DEI came mostly from students, recounts a professor. And if the aim of management education is even partly to simulate the challenges faced by grown-up executives, it is hard to imagine a curriculum ignoring such issues entirely. America\u2019s demography is changing, and so are employees\u2019 expectations about what their workplace ought to look like. The current backlash against DEI policies requires bosses to be far more thoughtful about how they approach them. It is requiring the same of business schools. That is easier said than done."}, {"role": "body", "text": "MBA students at HBS are taught using the \u201ccase method\u201d. Classes ask students to put themselves in the shoes of bosses facing a specific problem. Since 2020 students have complained that those shoes do not fit. The result has been a significant increase in the ethnic and gender diversity of the case \u201cprotagonists\u201d. But, as one faculty member notes, \u201cthe idea that you would be studying a chief financial officer doing a discounted-cashflow model, substitute a white man for a black woman, and then high-five all around is ridiculous.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "HBS made a course called \u201cinclusion\u201d compulsory for first-year MBA students in the academic year of 2021-22. A version of it, which focused heavily on race and gender, had previously been optional; \u201cWe heard from the students that you\u2019re teaching the course to the people that don\u2019t need it,\u201d says a faculty member with knowledge of the course. But many students and staff felt the new course lacked rigour and, partly because it was taught to a single group of 1,000 people, discouraged discussion. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Echoing worries about free speech on other campuses, professors whisper that conservative and religious students feel less able to speak up more generally. The view is supported by the results of a student survey shown to faculty last year. Shortly after the attacks on Israel on October 7th and the invasion of Gaza, Bill Ackman\u2019s comments about the war and Harvard\u2019s campus politics caused some HBS students to lobby the school to disinvite the billionaire investor (and HBS graduate) from appearing on campus as a \u201cprotagonist\u201d in a case about his hedge fund."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As in boardrooms, HBS\u2019s thinking on DEI is in flux. The inclusion course was first redesigned, to less damning reviews, then shelved. In June 2023 Francesca Gino, one of its architects, was put on unpaid administrative leave after accusations of fraud in her work (she has filed a lawsuit against Harvard University alleging breach of contract and gender-based discrimination). In the end, Mr Ackman did visit. Like America Inc, HBS is learning to walk the DEI tightrope\u2014the hard way. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 58}
