"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The movement has not imploded with Mr Bankman-Fried. The Centre for Effective Altruism (cea), a think-tank, runs conferences and online forums that still buzz with chatter. 80,000 Hours, a recruitment website run by the cea recommending \u201chigh-impact\u201d careers, has not seen visitor numbers drop. Devotees remain devoted. In a large survey by Rethink Priorities, a research group, at the end of 2022, 84% said they are still likely to be involved in the movement in three years\u2019 time. Many said they thought the community\u2019s leaders had responded well to the scandal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There has been soul-searching within the movement since well before the ftx scandal. It has focused on three main areas of fragility. First, the community has never been very big. It has probably never had more than 10,000 active members, mostly young, white men, many from elite universities. Alexander Berger, head of Open Philanthropy, the group that hands out money on behalf of Mr Moskovitz, says the effective-altruisim community is still \u201cmarginal\u201d.

According to rough estimates on the 80,000 hours blog, over one-third of the hypothetical $46bn committed in 2021 was down to Mr Bankman-Fried and his team at ftx. Almost half was attributable to Mr Moskovitz, who is now playing an even bigger role. Take GiveWell, an organisation that researches charities and recommends the most cost-effective ones. Its donor pool shrank in 2022, according to the group\u2019s own data. But total donations still ticked up that year, thanks to large gifts from Open Philanthropy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is a third thing, too. There are broader divisions about strategy, with some supporters determined to focus on improving lives today, while others are looking more at the long term and arguing for putting money into tackling far-flung risks.

They apply data-driven analysis to maximising impact on issues like tackling malaria, just as the philanthrocapitalists do.
