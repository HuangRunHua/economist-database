On January 27th the British Broadcasting Corporation silenced its oldest foreign-language radio service, BBC Arabic. Many of the World Service\u2019s 40-odd language broadcasts face the same fate. Staff say they have been told that by March the BBC will have stopped television transmission in Somali, Hausa and French for Africa, as well as radio output in Chinese and in the languages of Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent (not including Afghanistan). About a sixth of the World Service\u2019s 2,500 jobs are to go. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The bottom line is to blame. In 2014 the Foreign Office stopped core funding for the World Service, leaving the BBC to foot over 75% of a roughly \u00a3400m ($493m) annual bill. The freezing until 2024 of the licence fee, the corporation\u2019s main source of funds, has made the strain intolerable. \u201cHow far is it appropriate for audiences in Leicester, for example, to continue picking up the tab for services in, for example, Lagos?\u201d asked Richard Sharp, the BBC\u2019s chair, speaking at a recent event for the Whitehall &amp; Industry Group, a charity, above an alley called Little Britain. Without government funding, he warned, \u201cthe future of the World Service is in jeopardy\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Previous rounds of cuts have already depleted morale. Training has been pared back. There are fewer big interviews and scoops, more grammatical errors.

The BBC says that hiring in regional bureaus saves money and brings content closer to its audience. It will also bring journalists closer to repressive governments. Staff in Cairo, Egypt\u2019s capital, for instance, are subject to surveillance and have been hauled in for questioning. The BBC has told union leaders they cannot represent staff hired abroad."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Online content, though in growing demand, will also leave audiences stranded in countries where governments shut their people behind firewalls. Staff at the Persian service are aghast that the BBC is taking Persian radio off air next month, and is going online just as the Iranian authorities have cut the internet to silence nationwide protests. Audiences in countries with low and slow internet coverage will also suffer. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The World Service insists it retains the loyalty of its audience. Some 60% of Nigerians consume BBC news every month, it says, compared with 9% who consume content from China\u2019s state-run CGTN and 2% for Russia\u2019s RT. But as the BBC withdraws, autocrats may seize ground that has been vacated. Iran International, a broadcaster in London whose principal investor has previously done promotional work for the government of Saudi Arabia, has tempted BBC Persian staff away.
