Mr Paludan, an attention-hogging far-right Danish politician, had torched Korans before, but his choice of location was significant: Turkey is holding up the applications of Sweden and Finland to join NATO. Mr Paludan\u2019s demonstration permit was paid for by a Swedish journalist who once worked for a Kremlin propaganda channel, though the journalist denies any current connection to Russia. The Koran-burning led to anti-Swedish demonstrations across the Muslim world. Two days later Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s president, suspended his talks on NATO accession with both countries.

Their accession has been ratified by 28 of the alliance\u2019s 30 members. Hungary says it will ratify it soon. But Turkey has demanded that both countries first crack down on residents linked to movements that it considers anti-Turkish terrorists, mainly the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK. The three countries struck a deal last summer, and Finland and Sweden say they have done what they promised. Yet Turkey says it is not enough."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230204_EUM934.png", "imageWidth": "608", "imageHeight": "814", "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWe have fulfilled the memorandum, and it is time for Turkey to act,\u201d Tobias Billstrom, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, told The Economist. Sweden and Finland have both lifted arms embargoes they imposed on Turkey after it invaded Syria in 2019. In March Sweden will introduce legislation criminalising membership of terrorist groups, including the PKK, a step which required it to change its constitution. But Turkey also wants Sweden to extradite over 100 people, including some whom Sweden considers dissidents with a right to asylum. (Because it long had welcoming asylum policies, Sweden has a large Kurdish community of about 100,000. Finland has just 15,000 or so.)

Mr Erdogan faces a tough election in the spring or early summer, and has been whipping up nationalist resentment over Sweden\u2019s alleged pro-Kurdish, anti-Muslim offences. He demands that Sweden \u201creturn these terrorists to us\u201d and that it prevent any further Koran-burning before he will approve its NATO membership. Mevlut Cavusoglu, his foreign minister, accuses Sweden of \u201ctaking part in the crime\u201d of burning the Koran. Most Finns and Swedes, however, still expect the Turks to shift gear after the election and ratify their countries\u2019 accessions before NATO\u2019s next summit in Vilnius, Lithuania\u2019s capital, on July 11th. \u201cMany times we have seen domestic politics in Turkey leading to expressions like this,\u201d says Mr Billstrom."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet that may be wishful thinking. Turkey\u2019s ability to veto the NATO applications gives it a cheap lever over European affairs.

Finland\u2019s foreign minister has said that no split will be considered. Like so many European impasses, this one may require intervention from America, which could, for instance, use a long-delayed sale of F-16 fighters as a bargaining chip to get Mr Erdogan to approve the accessions.
