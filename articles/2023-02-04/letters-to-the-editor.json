Clearly there are opportunities for industries to start up or relocate to the North Sea. The region boasts a skilled workforce, stable institutions and an industrial culture. But the biggest additional asset is the potential for cheap and plentiful energy, mostly from wind power. Few other places in the world can match this."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All this wind energy is obviously renewable and can replace the existing use of fossil fuels. However, your article is unrealistically optimistic in this regard. At present, the six main countries that border the North Sea have a combined annual energy output of around 830 gigawatts. This includes renewable energy output of about 90GW. In order to achieve the goal of 80% of energy output coming from non-fossil sources by 2050, this 90GW must be increased to 670GW. This would require 240 nuclear-power stations of the size of Hinkley C, or 300 wind farms on the scale of the nearly completed Dogger Bank. Despite the skilled workforce and the plentiful winds, I very much doubt that this can be achieved within the next 28 years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "S.R.

We should be maximising the existing infrastructure, skills base and supply chain to accelerate the energy transition.
