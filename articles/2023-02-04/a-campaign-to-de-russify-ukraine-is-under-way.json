The cover of Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cChildhood, Boyhood and Youth\u201d, days away from being reborn as a coffee-cup sleeve or an egg carton, goes into one garbage bag. The novel\u2019s pages, destined to end up as paper for other books, in Ukrainian, or as cheap toilet paper, go into another. Next comes a selection of poems by Mayakovsky. Then a Soviet physics textbook. Then biographies of Pushkin and Dostoevsky. And so on."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The backlash against Russian culture in Ukraine had been picking up steam since 2014, when Russia occupied the Donbas and Crimea. But Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, together with the horrors committed by its troops, has sent it into overdrive. De-Russification has mostly been a bottom-up process or a matter of individual preference, as opposed to government policy. Millions of Ukrainians continue to speak Russian without suffering discrimination. But local authorities in many parts of the country are changing street names and pulling down Russian and Soviet statues.

Busts of Alexander Pushkin have disappeared from dozens of towns. In Odessa, a large statue of Catherine the Great, the 18th-century Russian empress who founded the city, was taken down and boxed up in late December and now collects dust in the basement of the city\u2019s fine-arts museum. On January 27th Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, one of Kyiv\u2019s oldest universities, announced it was banning even spoken Russian, though its president later backtracked and said the ban would not be enforced."}, {"role": "body", "text": "De-Russification has reached literature too. Syayvo, a bookstore in Kyiv, closed at the start of the invasion.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s modern-day tsar, Vladimir Putin, denies the existence of a separate Ukrainian culture. Russian occupation forces in eastern and southern Ukraine have set out to destroy it. Access to Ukrainian news websites has been blocked.

In the devastated city of Mariupol, the occupiers took down a monument to the victims of the Holodomor, the famine to which the Soviets condemned Ukraine in the 1930s and which killed millions of people. Schools are now forced to follow the Russian curriculum. Countless Ukrainians suspected of links to the government in Kyiv have been rounded up and abused. Some have been shot.

But he reckons literature should be off-limits, and that turning books into pulp is a step too far. \u201cThis reminds me too much of Mussolini,\u201d he says, unpersuaded by Mr Dyak\u2019s argument that recycling books is hardly the same thing as burning them. \u201cA book is a book.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Andrey Kurkov, perhaps Ukraine\u2019s best-known contemporary writer, was born in Russia and writes in Russian. \u201cI understand emotions,\u201d he says, but adds that some Ukrainian intellectuals are using de-Russification to boost their own patriotic credentials. He knows his own books will probably not be published in Russian until after the war. \u201cThe reaction to everything Russian is extremely negative and aggressive,\u201d he says.
