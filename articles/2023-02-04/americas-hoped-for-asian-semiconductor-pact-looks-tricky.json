America is reinforcing that development by limiting China\u2019s access to advanced chips and enticing chip firms to set up shop on its shores. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has called for a \u201cChip 4 alliance\u201d of America, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to co-ordinate chip policy. Yet America\u2019s allies in Asia are all pursuing their own self-interested chip strategies, which are just as often in tension with each other as they are symbiotic. \u201cThere are two sides of the coin: chip networks and chip wars,\u201d says Kuroda Tadahiro of the University of Tokyo.

By the 1980s Japan accounted for more than 50% of global semiconductor production. Wary of Japanese power, America rammed through a chip trade deal to the detriment of the Japanese industry. Competitors in South Korea and Taiwan rose, often with lots of support from their governments. Countries developed distinct chipmaking strengths (see chart). These days, America specialises in design while Taiwan dominates production of the highest-end logic chips. South Korea focuses on memory chips. Japan has niches in optical sensors and the materials and kit needed to make semiconductors. China, which has poured money into its own chipmaking industry, has made most progress in lower-end logic chips.

While that could make Korean firms more competitive, it could result in a \u201chollowing-out\u201d of the South Korean semiconductor industry, says Lee Seung-joo of Chung-Ang University in Seoul.

An amended innovation law passed in January and nicknamed \u201cTaiwan\u2019s chips act\u201d offers domestic chip companies 25% of their research and development costs in tax credits. In tsmc, Taiwan holds the chipmaking prize everyone else aspires to attract or duplicate with subsidies. In addition to its Japanese fabrication plant, tsmc plans to build two plants in America. Though its foreign investments do not involve its most advanced technology, they are causing consternation at home. Many in Taiwan fear tsmc\u2019s sorties could reduce America\u2019s incentive to defend Taiwan from China. The firm is keen to assuage the anxiety.

The Japanese government has also provided 70bn yen in seed capital to Rapidus, a new joint venture between leading Japanese electronics companies that will collaborate with foreign giants such as America\u2019s ibm and Belgium\u2019s imec in the hopes of developing a base for r&amp;d and production of leading-edge chips in Japan.

Tokyo Electron cut its annual operating income forecast by nearly 25% following the new American restrictions. Both Samsung and sk Hynix have significant manufacturing and r&amp;d facilities in China; between January and September of last year, about 40% of Korean chip exports went to China. There are also many ways China could make life difficult.

Wei, the ceo of tsmc, has said a shortage of capable engineers is the company\u2019s main bottleneck: engineers with basic capability need 8 years of training to work in one of tsmc\u2019s fabs. Some 300 Taiwanese engineers will move to Kumamoto to run the new plant there. Japan is meanwhile scrambling to train talent of its own.
