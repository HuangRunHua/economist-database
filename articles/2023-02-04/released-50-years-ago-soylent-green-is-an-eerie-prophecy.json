They all warn of the catastrophic damage that humans can do to the environment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first and best of these was \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d (1968), which ended (spoiler alert) with the revelation that civilisation had been destroyed in a nuclear war. In \u201cThe Omega Man\u201d (1971), civilisation had been wiped out again, this time by biological warfare. In \u201cSoylent Green\u201d\u2014released 50 years ago, in 1973\u2014civilisation is hanging on, but the situation is precarious.

The unnerving part is that the story is set in 2022. It is impossible to watch the film today without weighing up how accurate its predictions turned out to be. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Loosely based on \u201cMake Room! Make Room!\u201d, a novel of 1966 by Harry Harrison, \u201cSoylent Green\u201d is a melancholy conspiracy thriller written by Stanley Greenberg and directed by Richard Fleischer. Heston stars as Robert Thorn, a hard-bitten police detective in New York who shares a cluttered flat with his sweet old assistant, played by Edward G. Robinson in his final role (he died before the film was released)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A murder investigation takes Thorn to a plutocrat\u2019s spacious apartment in a fortress-like complex, where he encounters items that, in the world of the movie, are luxuries: soap, fresh apples and, most excitingly of all, air conditioning. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it cold like winter used to be,\u201d coos the apartment\u2019s live-in courtesan (Leigh Taylor-Young). The inquiry also takes Thorn towards the truth about Soylent Green, a tasteless foodstuff. It is supposedly made from plankton, but, given that the oceans have been despoiled, it is not."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Considering it was set five decades in the future, \u201cSoylent Green\u201d is remarkably unfuturistic. There are no spaceships or laser guns, just miserable figures shuffling around a dingy brown metropolis. For most people around the world, city life in 2022 was nicer than it is in the film-makers\u2019 imagination, the pandemic notwithstanding. But some elements are too close to reality for comfort: the enmeshing of politics and big business, the separation of rich and poor, and the clashes between the masses and the heavily armed riot police. The relentless, sticky heat may be familiar to modern viewers, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The film\u2019s most daringly cynical touch is that New York\u2019s citizens are resigned to the way things are. Nobody thinks that nature might one day recover. Nobody rebels against the corrupt system. Indeed, Thorn himself is happy to be a part of it, as long as he can supplement his income by accepting a few bribes and pilfering a few treats from crime scenes. In its own way, the complacency of the populace in \u201cSoylent Green\u201d is scarier than the mutants in \u201cThe Omega Man\u201d and the tyrannical gorillas in \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}]}
