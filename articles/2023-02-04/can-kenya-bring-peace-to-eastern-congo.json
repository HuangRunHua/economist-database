Neighbouring armies have mostly been responsible for the larceny, periodically plundering eastern Congo\u2019s vast mineral riches ever since Rwanda and Uganda first invaded in 1996. By contrast, the fecklessness has worn a blue helmet: the UN mission in Congo, one of the most expensive ever mounted, has proved singularly ineffective at stanching the anarchy that has forced 5m people from their homes and is impoverishing a region of more than 100m people."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many Congolese cheered when the East African Community (eac), a regional economic bloc, announced plans in June to deploy an intervention force. True, Uganda and Burundi, both past invaders with less-than-cuddly reputations, are contributing men. But Kenya, untainted by such grubbiness, was to lead the force. Here, at last, was an honest broker with sufficient diplomatic and economic heft to make a difference, with a genuine belief that stability will make the region richer. Better still, the force had a robust mandate to \u201ccontain, defeat and eradicate negative forces\u201d. With eastern Congo facing its gravest crisis in a decade, a Kenyan show of leadership could not have been more timely. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pride rose across the region, too. Even South Sudan, penurious, war-ravaged and more used to hosting peacekeepers than deploying its own, chipped in a battalion. Salva Kiir, its president, beamed with pride as he waved his men off on December 28th. \u201cDon\u2019t go engaging in the raping of women and girls,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t take anything from shops and civilians.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Alas, it has not taken long for the mood to sour. On January 18th police in Goma, the main city in Congo\u2019s east, dispersed a demonstration called to denounce the perceived inaction of Kenyan troops since they arrived there two months ago. True, the protest was small\u2014but anti-eac sentiment is undoubtedly growing. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Goma\u2019s 1m residents are understandably twitchy. In November 2021 a powerful rebel outfit, known as M23, re-emerged from its hideouts and embarked on a blood-soaking offensive. A leaked UN report alleges that Rwanda has armed it with sophisticated weapons and fought alongside it at pivotal moments. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "At a summit in Angola last November, regional powers demanded that the rebels withdraw from all territory seized since the start of the offensive. Kenya\u2019s contingent was meant to move in as M23 pulled back. The rebels, however, have called their bluff. Far from withdrawing, they have expanded their operations. On January 27th they seized the strategic town of Kitshanga, severing another road artery into Goma, which is now at serious risk of encirclement. Through all of this, the eac force has failed to fire even a single shot."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are good reasons for Kenya to avoid a fight with m23. The deployment of the regional force was more about giving weight to diplomatic pressure on Rwanda than becoming involved in the fighting. Clashing with the rebels would risk a conflict with Rwanda. Yet by raising expectations and doing nothing, Kenya is squandering goodwill and emboldening the rebels, who seem to have little to lose from continuing their offensive. \u25a0"}]}
