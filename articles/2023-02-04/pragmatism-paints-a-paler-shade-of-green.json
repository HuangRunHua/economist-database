The events took place in mid-January near the tiny hamlet of L\u00fctzerath in North Rhine-Westphalia. In what environmentalist groups had billed as a last stand, thousands of demonstrators braved freezing drizzle to protest against the expansion of an open-cast lignite mine, a city-sized gash of beige in a sea of green. After several days of muddy scuffles against a science-fiction backdrop of giant diggers, police bodily removed the last protesters, including Ms Thunberg."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The political blow to the Greens should have been huge. Spawned by sandal-clad anti-nuclear hotheads in the 1980s, the party now sits in power not just in Berlin but in ruling coalitions in 12 of Germany\u2019s 16 states, including North Rhine-Westphalia. Elected to slash emissions and protect nature, the Greens have instead been forced, thanks to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and disruption of energy flows to Germany, into embarrassing backdowns across a range of environmental issues. On their watch both nuclear and poison-spewing coal-fired power plants have enjoyed a new lease of life, fresh infrastructure for natural gas has been built, and ugly mines for especially dirty lignite or \u201cbrown coal\u201d, such as the one at L\u00fctzerath, have grown.

Their two top figures in government, Robert Habeck, the vice-chancellor and economy minister, and Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister (both pictured), have over the past year consistently ranked as Germany\u2019s two most popular politicians, far out-charming Olaf Scholz, the dry-as-a-cracker chancellor."}, {"role": "body", "text": "More surprising, the Greens have gained converts not by responding to the Ukraine crisis with calls for peace and moderation. Both the party leadership and its supporters have instead gone beyond every other party, including the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of former chancellor Angela Merkel, in pushing for stronger action against Russia. To the occasional chagrin of the Spd, the Greens have argued strongly for Germany to help arm Ukraine, including with heavy weapons. After Mr Scholz\u2019s recent, belated decision to supply German-made Leopard tanks, polls showed that more than three-quarters of Green party members backed the move.

Instead of shying away from touchy environmental issues he tends to confront them head on, armed with piles of facts and a quiet tone of sincerity. Asked about the L\u00fctzerath mine, he has patiently explained that under a deal worked out by his government, only half the lignite that its operator had planned to extract will ever be removed, with the deadline for its closure brought forward by eight years to 2030. Mr Habeck insisted in an interview with Der Spiegel, a weekly magazine, that the reason is not an abandonment of climate goals, but a temporary response to a pressing energy crunch. \u201cThere are many good reasons to demonstrate for climate protection,\u201d he said. \u201cBut L\u00fctzerath is simply the wrong symbol.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Polls suggest that most Germans are, however, puzzled by something that Mr Habeck seems to think is the \u201cright\u201d symbol.

Mr Scholz had to intervene with a compromise, allowing the plants, which still produce 6% of Germany\u2019s electricity, to keep running until April. Even many Greens may not see this as much of a victory. \u25a0"}], "id": 40}
