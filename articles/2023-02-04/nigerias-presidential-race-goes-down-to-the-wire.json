Nigerians, who will vote on February 25th, are poorer today than eight years ago. Much of the blame falls on the outgoing president, Muhammadu Buhari, who has governed badly during his eight years in office. Fully 89% of Nigerians think the country is heading in the wrong direction, according to Afrobarometer, a pollster. On his watch the economy has stagnated and violence has spread: last year at least 10,000 people were killed by criminal gangs, terrorists or the army. A country that once exported security through peacekeeping missions now exports trouble, destabilising neighbours. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet for all its travails, Nigeria is also Africa\u2019s biggest democracy\u2014with an opportunity for renewal. That matters in a country that has gone through five coups. The use of modern voting technology will make it harder to rig the results. More Nigerians are likely to vote than ever before. There is an \u201cunprecedented awakening\u201d among the young, who make up 40% of registered voters, says Opeyemi Oriniowo of the Nigeria Youth Futures Fund, an NGO based in Lagos, the commercial capital. These are telling signals in a continent where democracy is in retreat. Should an opposition party win, this would be only the second time since the generals returned to barracks in 1999 that voters have ejected an incumbent party by the ballot."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Three hopefuls seem to have a shot at victory. To secure it they have to gain not only the most votes nationally, but also win at least 25% of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and federal capital.

Despite the huge challenges facing Nigeria, it will not be policy proposals. Little distinguishes the candidates on the key issues; other factors come into play. Power-brokers often deliver blocks of votes by fair means or foul. \u201cWhoever the camp leaders say, that is who we will vote for,\u201d says Falmata Abdulrahman as she breastfeeds her daughter in a camp for displaced people in the north-east. Intimidation and vote-buying are common. \u201cWe were at the mercy of hoodlums and thugs,\u201d says Ahmadu Duste, who worked at a polling station in the last election. \u201cI saw voters being given cash.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The 70-year-old Mr Tinubu has the clearest path to victory because he has deep pockets and his APC controls 21 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 governorships. He expects to win handsomely in the south-west, his regional stronghold. He is hoping that his Muslim faith and that of his running-mate, Kashim Shettima, a former governor of the north-eastern state of Borno, will help him in the mostly Muslim north. Yet given the violence, fuel shortages and economic malaise in Nigeria, many voters may be wary of backing the incumbent party. Many also worry about Mr Tinubu\u2019s health, since he looks increasingly frail and has had to skip several big campaign events. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And some may question his character. Last year he settled a lawsuit in which he was accused of secretly owning 70% of a private company that was given a contract to collect taxes on behalf of Lagos state during his time as its governor (1999-2007). Court papers alleged that it earned a commission of 10% of all revenues it collected there. Mr Tinubu denies any wrongdoing.

That may set an imposing hurdle for Mr Abubakar. He is a northerner and a Muslim representing a party that in recent years has found support mainly in the Christian south. This time Mr Obi, a Christian who is backed by neither of the two dominant parties of yore, will eat into much of that support. \u201cMy pastor encourages us to vote for him,\u201d says Lydia Adamu, a churchgoer. Mr Abubakar is struggling to rally even his own party. Five pdp governors have withheld their endorsements and seem set to back his southern rivals.

Kayode Fayemi, a former APC governor advising Mr Tinubu\u2019s campaign, concedes that Mr Obi will probably take 80% to 90% of the vote in the south-east, his home region. Rivals deride his young fans as keyboard warriors who are not registered to vote.

Election officials are accused of dragging their heels in registering new voters, particularly in his stronghold, which has fewer voters on the books than other regions (see map).

Polling booths will be largely absent from areas infested with jihadists. Losers may stir up violence.

Some powerful Nigerians \u201cwant to pre-empt the people\u201d, he says, because they \u201cfeel that none of the candidates in the running now would be good for the country.\u201d Thankfully, a putsch would be hard to pull off.
