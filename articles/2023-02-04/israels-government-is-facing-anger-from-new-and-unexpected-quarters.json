Bar a blip in 2020, it has grown by almost 4% a year since 1996. Binyamin Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, has been in charge for much of this. He likes to take credit for the boom. Israel\u2019s business bosses have allowed him to do so."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No longer. His new government\u2019s plans to overhaul Israel\u2019s legal system, eroding the Supreme Court\u2019s independence and limiting its power to hold the executive to account, have prompted ire from his more predictable foes, including his political opponents and the judiciary. Now the country\u2019s economists and business leaders are chiming in too, warning that he may endanger the country\u2019s prosperity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In an open letter to Mr Netanyahu, two former central-bank governors told him that by weakening the court\u2019s independence he risks making Israel less attractive to foreign investors, driving down its credit ratings. \u201cThere is a correlation between processes which seem unconnected, like the judiciary\u2019s ability to review the government, and trust in the economy, which affects economic performance,\u201d they argued. The prime minister\u2019s proposals, they cautioned, could damage Israel\u2019s economy. Their warnings were echoed by another letter from 370 Israeli economists."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Similar missives have been sent by business leaders and investors in the tech sector, which in 2021 accounted for 54% of Israel\u2019s exports of goods and services. On January 24th around 1,000 tech workers at various firms in a number of towns held their first-ever strike in protest against the proposals. They walked out carrying signs saying \u201cNo Democracy\u2014No High-Tech\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some tech entrepreneurs have gone further, announcing that they are transferring their funds abroad. For an industry that fought for decades to bring foreign investment into Israel and took pride in keeping its research centres there, even when fledgling firms were bought up by foreign companies, this is unprecedented."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe Israeli high-tech sector has been seen as a role model of professionalism by investors and startups,\u201d says Fiona Darmon, a venture capitalist in Jerusalem. \u201cA professional and independent legal system is a bedrock for this.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The techies\u2019 concerns are not just financial. They reflect the ideological and social rifts within Israel that are behind the protests against the government. People in the tech sector hail overwhelmingly from Israel\u2019s middle class, which is mainly secular. Backers of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition tend to be more religious and working-class. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government is not only trying to weaken the liberal-leaning Supreme Court. It also wants to increase funding for lifelong rabbinical scholars and for religious schools that refuse to teach subjects such as maths and English. At the same time it proposes to slash projects beloved by secular Israelis, such as the public broadcasting corporation. \u201cIt feels like a government that is trying to do everything in its power to walk all over Israelis who work and pay the most taxes,\u201d says one tech executive."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So far Mr Netanyahu shows no sign of dropping his plans. His government\u2019s stability relies on the support of his far-right political partners. Meanwhile, the prime minister, who is facing charges of bribery and fraud (allegations he strenuously denies), has his own reasons for opposing Israel\u2019s legal establishment. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the latest accusations\u2014that he is imperilling Israel\u2019s economic success\u2014now preoccupy him. In recent weeks violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has soared. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed there by Israeli security forces. On January 27th a Palestinian gunman killed seven Israelis in Jerusalem. Yet despite such horrors Mr Netanyahu has stepped up a social-media campaign to focus on the economy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Netanyahu once again told business leaders in Tel Aviv that his policies were the source of Israel\u2019s economic success and a guarantee of future growth. His political rivals were running a \u201cscare campaign\u201d to deter investors, he said. Thousands of investors were staying away from Israel because of \u201clegal interference\u201d, he insisted. His reforms were designed only to help boost Israel\u2019s economy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "So far there are few signs that it is foundering. It grew by more than 6% in 2022. Whether Mr Netanyahu\u2019s plans will slow it down remains to be seen. \u25a0"}], "id": 32}
