After colonial legislatures restricted governors\u2019 powers to tax and spend, parliament struck back by passing the Stamp Act to tax the colonies\u2014and everyone knows the trouble that led to. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "After the Declaration of Independence, the articles of confederation gave each state a veto over federal borrowing, dooming America\u2019s credit and stunting its growth. Even Thomas Jefferson, that scourge of big government, saw the problem. While serving as minister to France he wrote to James Madison in 1788 that America had to prove it could be trusted to pay its debts. \u201cThe existence of a nation, having no credit, is always precarious,\u201d he wrote. Jefferson supported the Constitution, with its enhanced federal powers, partly to boost America\u2019s reputation as a borrower.

As the first Treasury secretary, Hamilton urged consolidating the debts of individual states and imposing new tariffs to pay them off. America\u2019s debt \u201cwas the price of liberty,\u201d he told Congress in 1790, and sound national credit would swell \u201cthe individual and aggregate prosperity of the citizens\u201d.

Even an imagination as rich as Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s might struggle to conjure an epic rap battle from this matchup. (Sampling from their public remarks\u2014Biden: The last guy who was president/increased the debt by 25 percent. McCarthy: (dabbing) When do you want to play/I\u2019m not going to just move on the same way!)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "And yet, as Mr Miranda might put it, history has its eyes on them: America\u2019s credit teeters in the balance. Pressured by his berserker caucus, Mr McCarthy is demanding cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, the limit to federal borrowing. The standoff has Washington\u2019s jaded federal class rolling its eyes, as it has learned to do from past confrontations, while\u2014it also does this every time\u2014mumbling, as a warding spell, that this time may be different. It may be, given Mr McCarthy\u2019s weak hold on a majority."}, {"role": "body", "text": "These debt-ceiling fights are American governance at its most stupid. As achievements in hypocrisy and self-defeat, they cannot be beat. When Republicans had unified control of government under Donald Trump, they freely raised the ceiling and, with it, the debt, while Democrats, for all their piety now, have also used the debt ceiling for leverage. As for self-defeat: the last time a Republican House pursued such brinkmanship the president was, of course, a Democrat (Barack Obama), and the result was a jump in rates that may have added half a billion dollars to the debt. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These episodic standoffs are revelatory also because they expose an underlying erosion of governance. The Republicans who are stamping their feet have a point. The budget process, if called to account for the meaning of either word, makes a mockery of both. While over the years the branches of government traded authority over budgeting, someone was always taking it seriously. This century, that has changed, as the debt-to-GDP ratio has almost tripled, to 98%. Debt held by the public stands at $24trn, and 7% of federal spending\u2014some $400bn a year\u2014goes to service it. After decades of low inflation, rising rates have reminded Americans how debt can become dangerous."}, {"role": "body", "text": "By law, Mr Biden is supposed to submit his budget on the first Monday in February, but he is going to miss the deadline for the third year, this time, reportedly, by a month. That is not good government. Congress also ignores its legal obligations to account for the public\u2019s money. In 2022, when Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, neither budget committee bothered to draft a budget resolution, meant to frame Congress\u2019s vision of revenue and spending. In the end, a few legislators vanished into the room where these things happen and emerged with a 4,155-page, $1.7trn \u201comnibus\u201d bill. Congress slammed it through and President Biden signed it just in time to avert another government shutdown.
