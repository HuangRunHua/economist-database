The cigar-chomping American director, whose wife was Italian, confessed that he had long been fascinated how in the torn-blouse iconography of post-war cinema, Italian women surpassed all others at raising, as he put it, the standard of glorious improbability in silhouettes. In a nation of fabulous females, he reckoned Gina was the most fabulous of all. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But (there had to be a but), she also had a mind of her own. It wasn\u2019t so much that she had dreams and wanted to express herself, she was ambitious. A loner as a child despite having three sisters, she focused on her plans rather than her playmates. As soon as she could, she left her native town. Up and up and up did Gina keep going, Welles tutted, his voice thick with cigar smoke and patronising disdain. His documentary was never broadcast; the only print went missing for nearly three decades. But years later, after it was rediscovered and finally screened in Italy, this fabulous female became so enraged at his portrayal of her that she persuaded the authorities to ban it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She was born in the same hilly town east of Rome as Lucrezia Borgia. Not yet 13 when Italy joined the second world war, she saw her home bombed by the Allies. Her father, a furniture-maker, lost all his stock in an air raid and the family fled to Rome where they lived in a single room. After school she would take lessons in singing, dancing and drawing\u2014supplementing the family income with sketches of American gis and modelling for photo comics known as fumetti. Before long, she entered for a Miss Rome beauty contest and won, and then was a runner-up for the title of Miss Italy. In 1950, when she was 23, she was cast as a beauty contestant in a film called \u201cMiss Italia\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Italy, in the immediate post-war years, was rebuilding its shattered towns and villages, but also creating a new future in the film lots known as Cinecitt\u00e0. On set she gained a reputation for diligently learning her scripts and being unusually hard-nosed about money. Studio executives asked her mother to convince her to accept a part, saying they would pay her a thousand lire. She countered, insisting her price was a million. Of course, they said, and soon she was shooting a new film each month. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was a studio photograph of her in a bikini that he saw in a magazine, rather than her screen presence, that caught the eye of Howard Hughes. The businessman turned film producer, who had recently acquired RKO Pictures and liked to cast women he was pursuing in films, summoned her to a screen test in Los Angeles. She asked if she could bring her new husband, but she flew on alone when the couple discovered at Rome airport that Hughes had sent only one air ticket. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The tycoon put her up for two months in a hotel suite, with a secretary, a chauffeur and an English teacher. She wasn\u2019t allowed out except in Hughes\u2019s company; he took her to cheap restaurants and taught her how to swear. Desperate to go home, she eventually signed a contract, but only learned later that it precluded her from making a film with any other studio in America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She could star in American films if they were shot abroad, and eventually she was in such demand that MGM was prepared to pay the $75,000 fine that was demanded for breach of contract if she returned to make a film in the United States. American studios mostly cast her as a foxy temptress or exotic fantasy; the Queen of Sheba in \u201cSolomon and Sheba\u201d with Yul Brynner or Esmeralda in \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d with Anthony Quinn. But that was to misunderstand her irrepressibly, impenitently Italian nature: hard-working, stubborn and self-willed, but also unbroken."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She may have lacked the wiles and vulnerability that would have made her a finer actress, but her essential Italianness led her to turn her back on Hollywood and embrace the work of her own countrymen, even if Hughes continued for more than a decade to dispatch lawyers to Italy to persuade her to divorce. They would ring the doorbell at the family villa on the outskirts of Rome and end up playing tennis with her husband instead."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her three finest films\u2014\u201cBread, Love and Dreams\u201d, a small-town romantic comedy about generational change which was set in the same central Italy where she grew up and which pitted personal desire against social duty, and \u201cThe Wayward Wife\u201d and \u201cWoman of Rome\u201d, both moralistic dramas based on the fiction of Alberto Moravia\u2014brought out an inner fire that was as emblematic of a nation in the throes of reinventing itself as it was revealing of a woman on the cusp of adulthood. All three came out in the same short period in the mid-1950s."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her disdain for the demands of studio heads and her insistence on managing her career exactly as she wanted had a curious effect on the men she worked with, who wanted either to bed her or to bring her down\u2014or perhaps both. Welles was not the only one. Humphrey Bogart, who starred opposite her in \u201cBeat the Devil\u201d, said she made Marilyn Monroe look like Shirley Temple and referred to her often as Gina Lo-lo-frigid-er."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Salad days"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The elegant villa on the old Appian Way that leads out of Rome with its gardens and its peacocks, the garlands of emeralds that jewellers would lend her for gala nights, the seemingly unending legal wrangles towards the end of her life with the young lovers and assistants who were accused of trying to steal her fortune\u2014all these gave the impression of a numerate, if vexatious, harpy, who was a bit heavy-handed with the eyeliner and mascara. To those who would listen, though, she always insisted she was a simple country girl from the Italian hills, one who gave her name to a lettuce called lollo rosso. Not only were its curly leaves a reminder of her own tousled tresses, its vigorous regrowth whenever it was harvested led it to be classified as a \u201ccut-and-come\u201d variety. A valiant survivor, just like la Lollo. \u25a0"}], "id": 77}
