If you meet the merchant\u2019s asking price of 300,000 baht ($9,200), your purchase will bolster at least three different sides in Myanmar\u2019s complicated and spreading civil war. You will help the brutal Burmese army, which controls the jade mines in the Himalayan foothills of Kachin state, worth tens of billions of dollars a year. And you will help an ethnic militia or two, representing minority groups that for years have fought for autonomy or independence in their homelands around Myanmar\u2019s periphery.

Thein Han is a Bamar refugee from Sagaing province in Myanmar\u2019s heartland. Two years ago, after General Min Aung Hlaing seized power in a violent coup and threw Aung San Suu Kyi and her recently re-elected government in jail, Mr Thein Han took to the streets in protest. He fled across the border after soldiers sought to arrest him one night; instead they nabbed his sister, who remains locked up. Mr Thein Han (not his real name) wants his future back. So each month he sends his savings to a chapter of the Pdf. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The new pdf militias represent a grim development in Myanmar\u2019s long-running conflict, which in the past two years is estimated to have claimed 30,000 lives and driven 2m people from their homes. The country had previously witnessed small-scale and decades-long ethnic conflicts. Separatists from the Karen minority have been up in arms since shortly after Myanmar (then called Burma) gained independence in 1948. Such micro-wars typically took the form of skirmishes in the dry season punctuated by regular ceasefires. Yet the coup that was launched by General Min Aung Hlaing in February 2021\u2014the latest of many military takeovers in Myanmar\u2014has profoundly altered the nature of the country\u2019s violence."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It sparked peaceful street protests, which the junta brutally crushed. Around 140 protesters are estimated to have been killed by the security forces on a single day in March 2021. Instead of quelling the protests, this ruthlessness has radicalised many young Burmese men and women, says Michael Vatikiotis of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a conflict-mediation group. The resultant armed Burmese resistance, exemplified by the pdf groups, represents a decisive break within the majority group from the non-violence preached by Ms Suu Kyi. The resistance groups have also broken new ground by making common cause with several of the ethnic minority militias, which are providing them with shelter, training and arms in their jungle hideaways. As a result, Myanmar\u2019s conflict has for the first time moved from the country\u2019s periphery deep into the Bamar heartland, including especially the pdf stronghold of Sagaing state.

The National Unity Government (nug), a shadow administration largely in exile, operates collectively and includes representatives of the country\u2019s main ethnic groups. The especially-persecuted Rohingyas, a Muslim people in a majority-Buddhist country, are among them. Yet the pdf groups are mostly not taking orders from the shadow government. There is a generational split between the political and armed groups. The shadow government represents an old guard, including staunch followers of Ms Suu Kyi who still cling to the principle of non-violent resistance. The pdfs are led by Young Turks who grew up watching democracy flower only to see it mown down.

Despite its intense geopolitical rivalry with China, America is reluctant to risk a proxy war by sending weapons to resistance forces on China\u2019s doorstep, says Scot Marciel, a former American ambassador to Myanmar. China, with interests in Myanmar that include imports of rare-earth metals and oil and gas pipelines to the Bay of Bengal, seeks to be on friendly terms with the country\u2019s prickly generals.

Its opponents are meanwhile growing increasingly organised and emboldened. A country long known for violence and dysfunction has become a catastrophe. \u25a0"}], "id": 17}
