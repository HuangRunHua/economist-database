But Scotland\u2019s embrace of self-ID made it possible: since 2014 the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has allowed prisoners to be housed with members of the sex with which they identify (regardless of whether they have taken hormones or undergone surgery). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Isla Bryson has now been moved to a men\u2019s prison. On January 29th the Scottish government said it would not place any \u201cnewly convicted transgender person with any history of violence against women\u2026in a female prison\u201d, pending a review. It has not said it would stop putting any males in women\u2019s jails. Scottish Trans, a group which helped the SPS draw up its policy, said a blanket ban would be wrong. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, agreed, saying it was important not to \u201ceven inadvertently suggest that trans women somehow pose an inherent threat to women\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Campaigners for women\u2019s rights (and others) point out that though most trans women pose no threat to women, there is no evidence that they pose less of a threat than other men.

Given that less than 2% of reported rapes lead to a conviction, claims that the prison service can weed out predatory males bear little scrutiny."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Putting males in female spaces also compromises women\u2019s privacy. This is particularly important in prison. Women constitute less than 4% of the prison population, and tend to be locked up for low-level, non-violent crimes. A majority of them have been victims of domestic violence. One former female convict has described how she was \u201cshaking with fear\u201d when she was forced to share a shower block with trans women in a Scottish jail. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "England and Wales also allow some trans women to be housed with female prisoners. But the Ministry of Justice has made this more difficult. In January it said no prisoner with male genitals would be housed with women. Some women\u2019s rights campaigners hope this will include those who hold a gender-recognition certificate (GRC), which means they are currently classed as female (regardless of their genital arrangements). Calls are growing for equality legislation to be amended to clarify that the protected characteristic of \u201csex\u201d, which allows some spaces and services to exclude men, means biological sex.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Part of the answer is vulnerable-prisoner units, which are used for those considered at particular risk (including some gay men and police informants). Because of the rise in the number of trans prisoners (see chart), some reckon a separate unit for transgender prisoners should be established. Jo Phoenix, a professor of criminology at Reading University, says this would help the criminal-justice system develop better ways of working with trans prisoners, including in such areas as rehabilitation. This is a group, she says, about which too little is known."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Scotland is unlikely to consider such policies any time soon. Ms Sturgeon, who seems to have succumbed to the influence of extreme trans activists, has struggled to explain how trans women are women except when they\u2019re violent predators. Her position has been made more difficult by her championing of Scotland\u2019s gender-recognition bill, which would have made it much easier for someone there to get a GRC than someone in England and Wales. When Westminster blocked the bill, Ms Sturgeon called it a \u201cfull-frontal attack\u201d on the Scottish Parliament. But it was her party that stopped changes making it harder for male sex offenders to get a GRC. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
