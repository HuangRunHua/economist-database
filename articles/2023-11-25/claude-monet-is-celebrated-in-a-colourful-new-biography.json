He had to crawl from the sea on all fours. But this incident did nothing to dampen his ardour for water: it was the principal motif in over 1,000 of his paintings. It was there in his earliest known sketches from 1856 (when he was 15) and in his water-lilies series, created in the final years of his life and becoming more abstract as his eyesight failed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Monet was a contradictory, difficult man. He abandoned his penniless muse, mistress and future wife, Camille, six weeks before she was due to give birth to his son, in order to visit other family and paint. But he was also capable of generosity and empathy. Friendships\u2014most notably with Georges Clemenceau, France\u2019s prime minister\u2014endured for decades."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Jackie Wullschl\u00e4ger, the chief art critic for the Financial Times, Monet has found a sympathetic, skilled biographer. (Remarkably, this is the first account of the celebrated artist\u2019s work and private life written in English.) Ms Wullschl\u00e4ger has a gift for seeing and sifting. Readers peek into the painter\u2019s account books, rummage through his correspondence and sit uncomfortably by during his long courtship of Alice, who served as a nurse to Camille before she died and was married to Ernest Hosched\u00e9, a buyer of Monet\u2019s paintings. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The biography most excels when it explains Monet\u2019s art. \u201cImpression, Sunrise\u201d (1872-73), the painting that gave the Impressionist movement its name, is \u201ca moment of breaking light and its reflections, ghostly boats cloaked in mist, dockyards implied by a few loose strokes\u201d. Readers learn that the large canvas of \u201cWomen in the Garden\u201d was painted only by Monet digging a ditch, which \u201cassured his stability of viewpoint\u201d far better than climbing a ladder. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Wullschl\u00e4ger lets Monet speak for himself. After a buyer purchases one \u201cHaystack\u201d painting for 2,500 francs ($500 at the time, around $17,000 in today\u2019s money), Monet requests that: \u201cIf anyone asks, I\u2019d be grateful if you would say\u201d the price was double. Monet once fibbed to a journalist that he worked only en plein air. In fact, he usually finished his canvasses indoors and could spend months on a single work. (He tarried so long on one wintry landscape that he had to hire men to strip an oak of its foliage when he found himself still working on it in May.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Monet who emerges is complicated. When young, he shamelessly begged friends and family for financial help, but years later he refused to let his stepdaughter marry Pierre Sisley on the grounds that the latter was \u201can impecunious painter\u201d. Perhaps it is no surprise that his most lasting relationship\u2014in art and in life\u2014was with water, a mutable and sometimes fearsome element. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 75}
