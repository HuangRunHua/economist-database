As you pointed out, the temptation to use secondary legislation has proved irresistible to governments of all colours. The fact that such legislation can only be approved or rejected and cannot be amended has meant that both houses of Parliament, and particularly the Lords, have been reluctant to press the \u201creject\u201d button. Indeed, on the last occasion the Lords did so, in 2015 over tax-credit cuts, a full-scale constitutional crisis resulted. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "How to redress this? One way would be to create some form of triaging process that would enable scrutiny by both houses to be focused on those regulations where it was really needed. The present procedure is more than adequate for probably more than 90% of the 700 or so pieces of secondary legislation brought forward in a normal parliamentary session. This would refute the likely argument by the government that any change to the scrutiny arrangements would gum up the whole machinery of government. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A new procedure requiring proper debate and containing a power to amend could then be introduced for the remaining regulations. This would give some teeth back to the legislature. A number of us in the Lords have made practical suggestions as to how this might work. But it will only happen if backbench MPs are prepared to pick up the ball and run with it. Any other approach will result in the government of the day alleging that this is the unelected Lords telling the elected Commons how to do its job better. That would be game over.

He or she would need to focus on their main task of passing quality legislation and less time on the local affairs of their much bigger constituencies.

They were given a time limit to reach international levels of price and quality, after which the protection would be removed.
