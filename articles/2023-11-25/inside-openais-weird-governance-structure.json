Getting your technology from a non-profit, or a for-profit company that is entirely controlled by one human being?\u201d asked Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, at a conference in Paris on November 10th. That was Mr Smith\u2019s way of praising OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, and knocking companies like Meta, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social-media giant. Events of the past week, which began on November 17th with OpenAI\u2019s board firing its boss, Sam Altman, and ended four days later with his return to the startup he co-founded, have made the non-profit setups look rather less attractive. They have also thrown a spotlight on AI darlings\u2019 unusual governance arrangements. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "OpenAI is not the only firm in its industry with an odd structure. Anthropic, created by rebels from OpenAI, and Inflection AI (whose co-founder, Mustafa Suleyman, is a board member of The Economist\u2019s parent company) were formed as public-benefit corporations, which balance investor returns with social good. Anthropic also has a \u201clong-term benefit trust\u201d with power to elect new directors to a gradually expanding board. Even so, OpenAI is an outlier. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The firm was founded as a non-profit in 2015 by Mr Altman and a group of Silicon Valley investors and entrepreneurs including Elon Musk, the billionaire behind Tesla, X (formerly Twitter) and SpaceX. The group collectively pledged $1bn towards OpenAI\u2019s goal of building artificial general intelligence (AGI), which would outperform humans on most intellectual tasks. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "After a few years OpenAI realised that in order to attain its goal, it needed cash to pay for expensive computing capacity and top-notch talent\u2014not least because it claims that just $130m or so of the original $1bn pledge materialised. So in 2019 it created a for-profit subsidiary. Profits for investors in this venture were capped at 100 times their investment (though thanks to a rule change this cap will rise by 20% a year starting in 2025). Any profits above the cap flow to the parent non-profit. The company also reserves the right to reinvest all profits back into the firm until its goal of creating AGI is achieved. And once that is done, the resulting AGI is not meant to generate a financial return; OpenAI\u2019s licensing terms with Microsoft, for example, cover only \u201cpre-AGI\u201d technology. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "If and when AGI has been attained is determined by the board of directors. Instead of representing OpenAI\u2019s financial backers, the norm at most companies, OpenAI\u2019s charter tasks directors with representing the interests of \u201chumanity\u201d. Until the events of the past week, humanity\u2019s representatives comprised three of OpenAI\u2019s co-founders (Mr Altman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever) and three independent members (Adam D\u2019Angelo, co-founder of Quora; Tasha McCauley, a tech entrepreneur; and Helen Toner of Georgetown University). They wielded wide-ranging powers granted to the board by OpenAI\u2019s bylaws. This includes the right to add or remove board members, if a majority of directors concur. Most important, the board remains answerable only to itself."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This structure was designed to ensure that OpenAI could resist outside pressure from investors, who might prefer a quick profit now to safe AGI for humankind later. In the wake of the Altman fiasco, that now seems unworkable. Of the old guard, all but Mr D\u2019Angelo have gone. Instead, he is joined by Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce, a big software firm, and Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary. The plan is to bring in six more heavy-hitters, including a representative of Microsoft and, possibly, Mr Altman. They are likely to be more attuned to investors\u2019 interests. Yet without deeper reforms to OpenAI\u2019s governance, the new lot will retain the same unchecked powers. \u201cThe structure defies corporate physics,\u201d says an AI investor. Sooner or later it will need shoring up. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more of our articles on artificial intelligence"}], "id": 56}
