Elon Musk, X\u2019s boss, replied; \u201cYou have said the actual truth\u201d.

The Brookings Institution, a think-tank, found that antisemitic posts then went viral. After Mr Musk\u2019s tweet, Media Matters, a watchdog group, reported that X was placing big brands\u2019 ads alongside neo-Nazi posts. Comcast and Disney, among others, briskly pulled ads from the platform.

The number of incidents in just 40 days amounts to one-third of last year\u2019s total, according to the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy group. A college student was arrested for threatening to slit Jews\u2019 throats on campus; your Jewish correspondent was berated by a woman who suggested calling in bomb threats to stop Jews from voting. The FBI\u2019s boss says the number of anti-Jewish hate crimes is reaching historic highs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the past month, much attention has been paid to antisemitism among left-wing college students. Survey data, though, show that antisemitic attitudes in America are concentrated on the far right. The conspiracy that Jews plot to replace whites motivated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter and the neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville. Yet an extreme double standard has also been seen on the left. Many American Jews feel abandoned by progressive friends who seem quick to tag Jews, even ones disconnected from Israel, as oppressors. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Will antisemitism wane? A study by Eitan Hersh of Tufts University and Laura Royden of Harvard University found that although young non-white Americans are generally less prejudiced than older ones, they are considerably more likely to agree with statements such as that Jews have too much power in America. Black and Hispanic youngsters, regardless of their politics or religion, are just as antisemitic as those on the alt-right. Those minorities with college degrees expressed even more suspicion of Jews. There is little reason to believe they will grow out of it. Mr Musk\u2019s views have more likes than you think. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 26}
