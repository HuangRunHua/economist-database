That is about $100,000 for every Emirati citizen. But oil is not the only reason the country is prospering. In a time of war and economic fragmentation, the UAE seems to be a port in a storm. Multinationals are setting up factories and offices at a rate not previously seen in the UAE\u2019s five decades of independence. Oil and gas now account for just a third of GDP, and the oily bits of the economy are growing more slowly than the rest of it. The economy as a whole grew by 3.7% in the first half of the year compared with the same period in 2022. Excluding oil and related industries, it grew by 5.9% (see chart 1)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The UAE\u2019s standing in the world seems to be growing rapidly, too.

But through both its embrace of global business and its foreign investments, including in clean energy and logistics, it is binding itself to other countries around the world. Its economic openness and its apolitical approach to business give it broad appeal: it is one of the few places where Americans, Chinese, Iranians, Israelis and Russians all rub shoulders."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the UAE is not without its challenges. As oil becomes less central to the economy, the social contract is changing. The government does not simply rake in petrodollars and distribute them to citizens in the form of cushy jobs and subsidised goods; it has begun levying taxes and prodding locals to seek more demanding work in the private sector. Since the UAE is an absolute monarchy (or rather, seven of them combined in a federation dominated by the richest, Abu Dhabi), there is little outlet for popular discontent. The lack of checks on the rulers\u2019 authority can lead to arbitrary and ill-considered policymaking, especially in foreign relations.

Pearl-diving, the previous mainstay of the sleepy trading outposts along the shores of the Gulf, collapsed in the early 20th century after Japanese researchers worked out how to farm pearls. Oil was discovered in the 1950s; by 1971, when the UAE gained independence from Britain, it was well on its way to becoming a petrostate. It sits atop more oil than Russia, and is the world\u2019s seventh-biggest producer, pumping more than 3m barrels a day. Only Guyana and Kuwait have more oil relative to their population. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Despite this bounty, the UAE\u2019s rulers were among the first in the Gulf to try to diversify their economy. Dubai, which has little oil of its own, led the way, creating lightly regulated, low-tax economic zones designed to attract multinationals. Although it needed bailing out by Abu Dhabi after a spectacular property crash in 2009, its basic economic formula, of turning itself into a trading entrepot, transport hub and financial centre, remains successful. At the same time, the UAE has invested its oil wealth in strategically important industries and strategically important parts of the world. The intention is to make itself a force in global trade, finance and geopolitics. Much of this approach, locals note with condescension, is being copied by Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince of neighbouring Saudi Arabia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Start with the Emirates\u2019 role as an entrepot. The fact that it is within easy flying and shipping distance of most of Africa, Europe and Asia makes it a natural hub. DP World, a firm owned by the government of Dubai, runs Jebel Ali, one of the world\u2019s biggest container ports. Dubai airport is the busiest in the world for international travel.

In an index of economic freedom compiled by the Heritage Foundation, an American think-tank, the UAE ranks 24th out of 176 countries\u2014one notch above America. Foreigners laud the ease with which offices can be set up, flats rented, visas approved. \u201cEveryone thinks commercially, and no one thinks politically,\u201d notes an Israeli entrepreneur with a big office in Dubai. On a trip to the country a few weeks after the war between Israel and Hamas began, he found the UAE just as welcoming as ever. Local governments run \u201ccustomer happiness centres\u201d.

A fifth went to Indian firms; the numbers of companies from China and elsewhere in the Middle East also grew rapidly. Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, has had some success luring financial firms. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The influx reflects the varied roles the UAE can play for firms from different countries. For Chinese ones, it has become an offshore trading hub. One example is Dragon Mart, a wholesale and retail complex in Dubai that bills itself as the biggest trading hub for Chinese goods outside China. Last year DP World helped set up Yiwu Market, which hopes to eclipse it. For Indian firms, the UAE offers what Hong Kong and Singapore do for China and South-East Asia: an easier place to do business internationally, with more efficient courts, better infrastructure and access to capital and talent. It is also becoming a second home of sorts.

Iranian oil is often exchanged at sea off the emirate of Fujairah, blended with other crude and sold on.

Russian businessmen, no longer able to live in America or Europe, have relocated to waterfront villas in Dubai.

In 2022 an Emirati consortium including Abu Dhabi Ports signed an agreement to invest $6bn in a port and agricultural project in Sudan. DP World operates on dry land, too: in Rwanda it has invested in a Road Transport Centre that has, according to a report by Knight Frank, a consultancy, reduced domestic shipping times from weeks to days. In India it has invested in railway lines; in southern Africa, in a logistics firm. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another niche is clean energy. In 2006 the UAE made a prescient bet, setting up a firm called Masdar to diversify its energy supply and build on its energy expertise by investing in renewables (the firm was initially run by Sultan al-Jaber, who now heads Abu Dhabi\u2019s national oil company and is the president of COP28). Masdar is now one of the world\u2019s biggest developers of wind farms and solar power. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Emirati officials hope to pull off a similar feat in another emerging industry: artificial intelligence. Abu Dhabi was quick to try to seize on the technology\u2019s potential, setting up a research institute, making available vast amounts of capital and recruiting talented Western and Chinese researchers. The result was Falcon, an open-source large language model which some technologists consider better than Meta\u2019s offering, Llama 2. The government now wants to use this as the basis for a layer of proprietary models in specific fields, such as health care, which it hopes to sell.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sometimes, however, it appears to be diplomatic imperatives that dictate commercial decisions, rather than the other way around. The UAE is eager to build influence in its region. Earlier this month it signed a deal with Jordan to jointly invest $2bn in infrastructure and development projects.

In Sudan, for instance, the militia backed by the UAE is accused of a genocidal campaign against Black Africans in the province of Darfur. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "It does not help that the UAE\u2019s disreputable allies often advance its commercial interests. In Sudan they fund themselves in part through their control of gold mines, whose output is sold largely in Dubai. The UAE is also naturally eager to protect Abu Dhabi\u2019s big investments in Sudan.

It has made prescient economic bets, but reckless ones, too. Drive from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, and you pass by desolate stretches of land once meant to house theme parks that were never built. In 2018 the federal government promised to do half of its transactions on the blockchain by 2021; Dubai\u2019s officials once promised to become \u201cfully powered by blockchain by 2020\u201d.

Abu Dhabi is one of the world\u2019s lowest-cost producers, so would remain in the oil business even in a world of declining consumption. But it is preparing for a time when the bonanza may dwindle. In part, that means making the UAE still more attractive to foreign labour and business. But it also means finding alternative revenue streams and cutting costs. The government has introduced a value-added tax and a corporate income tax. Fuel subsidies were phased out in 2015. No one says it out loud, but a personal income tax also seems inevitable.

Schoolchildren lag far behind their rich-country counterparts in standardised testing, and drop-out rates are high. So far the unpicking of the social contract has led to grumbling but no unrest. To keep it that way will require a more concerted effort at training the labour force, and a delicate touch.

A global transition away from fossil fuels, if it ever materialises, will be a shock. The Emirates\u2019 assertive foreign policy will continue to strain its alliances. In particular, its relationship with Saudi Arabia could become more complicated and more competitive.
