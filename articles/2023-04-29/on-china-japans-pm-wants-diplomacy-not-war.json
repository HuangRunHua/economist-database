Even after Chinese and Japanese ships clashed over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands a decade ago, American leaders pursued engagement. \u201cWe warned the US,\u201d a former Japanese ambassador once grumbled to Banyan. But these days the mercury in America has risen sharply\u2014its politicians compete to see who can sound most hawkish on China. This is now giving Japan the opposite worry."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In an interview with The Economist and other global media on April 20th, Kishida Fumio, Japan\u2019s prime minister, was asked what his country was doing militarily to contain China\u2019s hegemonic ambitions. He was reluctant to wade in. Instead of naming the many measures that Japan is taking to bolster its defences, he said: \u201cWhat must be prioritised is proactive diplomacy.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "So it continued. Speaking ahead of the G7 summit that Japan will host in his home town of Hiroshima next month, Mr Kishida, glancing often at briefing papers, took pains not to make Japan\u2019s troubled relations with China even worse. \u201cJapan will assert what needs to be asserted and urge responsible action while maintaining a firm dialogue on various issues and co-operating on common challenges,\u201d he added. He repeated his wish to build a \u201cconstructive and stable\u201d relationship with China. He used much the same formulation in a speech he gave in January in Washington."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are indeed many indications that Japan thinks the American-Chinese rivalry has got too hot. Japanese leaders now consistently call for better communication with China. Sino-Japanese diplomacy has quietly resumed since the first summit between Mr Kishida and Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, in Indonesia in November. In late February officials from the two countries\u2019 foreign and defence ministries met. At the end of March, their armed forces established a defence hotline. Hayashi Yoshimasa, Japan\u2019s foreign minister, went to Beijing on April 2nd, the first such visit in three years."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Japanese parliamentarians are also showing restraint. The Diet has nothing resembling the belligerent China Select Committee in America\u2019s House of Representatives. Japan\u2019s parliament has a longstanding Japan-China Parliamentary Friendship Association\u2014which this week named Nikai Toshihiro as its head. An ageing kingmaker, he is best known for his close ties to Beijing. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This does not mean Japan is any less wary of China. Mr Kishida repeated calls for \u201cpeace and security in the Taiwan Strait\u201d and signalled Japan\u2019s unwillingness to tolerate \u201cchanges to the status quo through force\u201d\u2014code for opposition to Chinese aggression against Taiwan. Japan\u2019s plans to double defence spending over the next five years are all about making China believe it cannot be pushed around. No one in Tokyo needs convincing that China poses a threat."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the contrary, the proximity of that threat makes Japan treat it very seriously. In America, talk of war over Taiwan is an abstraction half a world away; in Japan, it makes people wonder where the nearest bomb shelter might be. That is why Japan, unlike the hotheads on Capitol Hill, is taking such pains to control the temperature. \u201cIt is very important for the international community that the US-China relationship remains stable,\u201d stressed Mr Kishida."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There are signs that the message is getting through. Partly at Japan\u2019s urging, the communiqu\u00e9 issued by a gathering of G7 foreign ministers on April 18th, in the Japanese province of Nagano, includes a call to countries to engage \u201ccandidly\u201d and \u201cwork together\u201d with China\u2014the diplomatic equivalent of an extended hand. Katherine Tai, the United States Trade Representative, reassured an audience in Tokyo on April 20th that America does not intend to decouple from China. The same day Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, said that America seeks \u201cconstructive and fair\u201d ties with China. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet moderating the temperature will only get harder. America\u2019s election season is coming and Tokyo has become a stop on the circuit. (Ron DeSantis, Florida\u2019s ambitious Republican governor and rival to Donald Trump, visited on April 24th.) And China is hardly taking the proffered hand; a Japanese pharmaceutical-company employee was arrested on espionage charges in Beijing last month. China\u2019s willingness to speak with Japan is mostly about trying to drive a wedge between America and its allies. Even so, Mr Kishida\u2019s stab at Indo-Pacific temperature control may be his most important geopolitical contribution.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia:Michael Lipton: The big man of land reform (Apr 20th)Narendra Modi is rewriting Indian history (Apr 13th)China\u2019s huge Asian investments fail to buy it soft power (Apr 5th)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Also: How the Banyan column got its name"}], "id": 16}
