The set-up is generally the same: elderly singles can flick through different \u201crooms\u201d on their phones, checking out other prospects. If one catches their eye, they can request to join the room. A host plays the role of doorman, matchmaker and bouncer. When two people hit it off, contact details are exchanged and the host receives a fee. The spectacle draws a crowd. One host has upwards of 500,000 followers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Live-streams are one of many new ways old people are trying to find love. Data from Baidu, an online-search giant, suggests that more than half of the 100m registered users of Pair, a dating app, are 50 or older. Another app, called Middle-Aged and Elderly Life, was launched in 2019 and has grown in popularity. That same year the founder of Baihe, China\u2019s largest dating service, left the company to start Leisure Island, a social network for the elderly that has dating features."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Demand for such products is being driven by an increase in the elderly population. Nearly 210m Chinese people are 65 or over, up from around 160m five years ago. The average life expectancy in China is up, too, rising from just under 73 in 2005 to almost 78 today. There isn\u2019t much recent data on how many of the country\u2019s oldies are single. But a survey published in 2015 by the China Research Centre on Ageing showed that over a quarter of people 60 and over were either single, separated or widowed. According to a survey from 2014 by Renmin University, nearly 10% of old people live alone. Traditional attitudes towards old people remarrying and potential opposition from children do not help. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The live-streams have evolved from dating shows, which are still quite popular and provide insight into the pragmatic approach taken by old singles. On \u201cNot Too Late After All\u201d, one such show, contestants ask pointed questions of potential partners, such as whether they have a pension, a house or any children. Some want to know more about a match\u2019s health or previous relationships. In a clip that went viral, a 78-year-old man said he was looking for a servant."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cNot Too Late After All\u201d receives, on average, 80 applications a day, according to a producer. For those who do not make the cut or are not as tech savvy as Deng, there are still other ways to find a mate. Some urban green spaces are known for their matchmaking corners, where parents try to set up their children and old people put up posters introducing themselves. But finding love in old age is no walk in the park.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Subscribers can sign up to Drum Tower, our new weekly newsletter, to understand what the world makes of China\u2014and what China makes of the world."}], "id": 18}
