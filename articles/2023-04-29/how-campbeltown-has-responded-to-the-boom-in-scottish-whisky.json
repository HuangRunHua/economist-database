Its grand sandstone villas attest to a prosperous past, when more than 30 distilleries thickened the air with peat smoke. But then came more than a century of decline\u2014caused by war, the Depression, Prohibition in America and rail-borne competition from places farther north like Speyside (see map).

New markets, especially in Asia, boosted demand; consumers\u2019 enthusiasm for mixing cocktails during the pandemic topped it up.

Springbank, the eponymous malt produced in Campbeltown by Scotland\u2019s oldest independent family-run distillery, fetches some of the highest prices of all.

Overseen by the 92-year-old great-great grandson of Archibald Mitchell, who founded the distillery in 1828, Springbank has stuck to traditional production methods, where possible using the original equipment. Touring its Victorian buildings is like going to a museum. Tourists queue early to buy the small quantity of whisky put aside for the shop\u2014Springbank refuses to sell online, believing, probably correctly, that the distillery outlet attracts visitors to the faded town. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Everything is done on site, from germinating the barley, which is left on a stone floor and turned every four hours by hand, to labelling. This is labour-intensive work: the distillery has a staff of 100, making it an important employer in a region that suffers from high unemployment. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2000 the owner of Springbank, J&amp;A Mitchell, bought and then reopened Glengyle, a distillery next door that had closed down in 1925. But rather than using the purchase to crank up production, it spread it across two sites. Several months a year Springbank\u2019s workers down tools and move to Glengyle to make whisky. The impression this creates\u2014of rare malts that buyers would be lucky to get their hands on\u2014works well. Prices for Springbank\u2019s single malts have surged. It hasn\u2019t bothered with advertising for several years. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Others want in. There are plans for a new distillery overlooking Campbeltown Loch. But growth may come from outside the town. The Campbeltown whisky region\u2014one of five, along with Highland, Islay, Lowland and Speyside, as codified in the 2009 Scotch Whisky Regulations\u2014extends a little way outside Campeltown itself.
