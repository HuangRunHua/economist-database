Liberals abhorred him; conservatives tuned in to see him rail against \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and other liberal pieties. But after the New York Times reported that Fox had paid out $13m to settle lawsuits from five women accusing him of sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour, and more than 50 advertisers abandoned his show, the network unceremoniously kicked Bill O\u2019Reilly to the kerb (Mr O\u2019Reilly has long denied the charges)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "History does not repeat itself, but it sometimes rhymes. On April 24th Fox parted ways with Tucker Carlson, currently the most popular host on cable television, who also rouses liberal ire. Fox is also facing a lawsuit, this time brought by one of his former producers, Abby Grossberg, accusing the network and Mr Carlson\u2019s staff of sexism and anti-Semitism\u2014charges that Fox and Mr Carlson deny."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Expensively and coastally educated, Mr Carlson was always an unlikely populist. His stepmother is heir to a frozen-goods fortune. Earlier in his career he worked for PBS and MSNBC, both liberal stalwarts. Mr O\u2019Reilly affected an outer-borough pugnacity; Mr Carlson\u2019s blue blazers, repp ties and cocksure delivery made him appear the embodiment of an old-school, East Coast establishment Republican."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That species, though, is as endangered as the blue whale. Mr Carlson\u2019s political views are, by contrast, a strange mixture of cranky and hard-edged. Like many on the new right, he has fawned over the corrupt, illiberal regime in Hungary. He has argued that Democrats are \u201ctrying to replace the current electorate\u2026with new people, more obedient voters from the third world\u201d\u2014a theory that finds favour on the far right. He has downplayed the attack on the Capitol on January 6th 2021, airing selectively edited video and claiming the rioters were \u201cmeek\u201d \u201csightseers\u201d. He has been relentlessly hostile to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. And he has reliably supported Donald Trump."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In private, however, his feelings about Mr Trump were not so warm. Just two days before the Capitol riot, he texted his producer: \u201cI hate him passionately.\u201d To another colleague, he wrote: \u201cWe are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can\u2019t wait.\u201d These texts emerged as part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems, which Fox settled on April 18th. Mr Carlson had some interesting things to say about Fox\u2019s management, too. \u201cThose f-s are destroying our credibility,\u201d he wrote. It is not yet clear if he was fired because he was caught misleading his viewers or because he was caught badmouthing his bosses. Perhaps it was neither: Gabriel Sherman, a noted Fox watcher, reported in Vanity Fair that Mr Carlson was a favourite of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s now ex-fianc\u00e9e, Ann Lesley Smith."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some see Mr Carlson\u2019s unceremonious departure\u2014he and his executive producer, who is also out, reportedly had no inkling of their fate\u2014as a tacit admission of wrongdoing, intended to reassure investors and pre-emptively staunch an advertising outflow of the sort that hit Mr O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show. Just a few days earlier, Fox parted ways with another Trump-boosting host, Dan Bongino. Perhaps Fox is cleaning house and needs a couple of severed heads to remind its employees of the distinction between pandering to its base, as partisan political programmes on both Fox and MSNBC frequently do, and defaming people or companies that might sue. Perhaps it was related to Ms Grossberg\u2019s lawsuit."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whatever the reason, Mr Carlson\u2019s departure, like Mr O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, is a reminder that while Fox News may nurture and create stars, it is not beholden to them. When their antics become too costly or embarrassing, they are shown the door. Markets were unimpressed: Fox\u2019s stock dropped sharply this week. But there is a lesson here for gleeful lefties too. They danced on Mr O\u2019Reilly\u2019s grave, and Mr Carlson sprang up to replace him. Fox News is still the most-watched cable network in the country, and has seen off threats from upstart rivals on the right. It won\u2019t take Fox long to find someone else to thrill its viewers and enrage American liberals. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 22}
