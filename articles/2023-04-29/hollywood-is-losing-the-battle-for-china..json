Now that relations between China and America are eliciting cold-war comparisons, Chinese leaders are eager to displace Western influence. \u201cOf all the nations in the world,\u201d Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, has said, China \u201chas the most reasons to be culturally confident.\u201d"

And our analysis of film reviews on Douban, a social network, suggests that in China\u2019s domestic market, the scales are tipping in Mr Xi\u2019s favour. During the past decade, Western cinema\u2019s share of viewership in China appears to have declined."

Although China lets cinemas show just 34 foreign titles per year, users have rated thousands of foreign films, presumably using pirated versions. We downloaded scores and view counts for all 26,000 films listed on Douban produced between 2010 and 2022. Almost 10,000 of these are \u201cAnglo\u201d films (in English, from English-speaking countries), and 4,500 were produced in mainland China. The rest are largely European, Japanese and Korean. Over this period, Anglo films made up 43% of recorded views. China ranked second, at 36%, followed by Japan (6%) and South Korea (5%)."

The change is not driven by China simply making more films\u2014its share of total movies made only rose from 13% to 18%. (In 2022 China\u2019s shares dipped because its zero-covid policy limited film production, but its numbers are likely to return to prior levels.)"

Viewers rated them worse in 2022 than they did a decade earlier\u2014and on average, half a star lower on a five-star scale than Anglo films (see chart). Many other factors, such as marketing, casts or changes in Douban users\u2019 behaviour, could affect ratings and view counts. But such poor ratings suggest that although China may be fending off Western soft power at home, its cultural exports are not ready to gain traction abroad."

It chronicles a former special-operations soldier doing battle in Africa with a ruthless American mercenary leader.

But their popularity suggests that the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda organs are making an impact. Increasingly, home-grown cinema is shaping how a generation of Chinese people view their country and its place in the world."
