Angry at dismal pay, they walked out of their classrooms for nine days and converged on the state capitol to demand more money. This was part of a wave of teachers\u2019 strikes that year in Republican-dominated states, including Arizona, Kentucky and West Virginia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Five years later, things are different. The Oklahoma legislature, which has a Republican supermajority, passed an average salary increase of $6,100 in the days before the strike; then a smaller increase of $1,200 the next year. It is currently debating a further increase of $3,000-6,000, depending on seniority. From the sitting room of the governor\u2019s mansion, Kevin Stitt, the recently re-elected Republican governor, is upbeat about the pending pay-increase legislation and dreams of paying the best teachers in the state \u201cup to $100,000\u201d by the end of the year."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Oklahoma is hardly the only Republican-dominated state shovelling money at teachers. This is happening even as the party has been banging on about the problems of public schools, accusing teachers of indoctrinating children with critical race theory (CRT) and gender ideology."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, has placed himself in serious contention to be the party\u2019s next presidential nominee by campaigning against wokeness in schools and universities; yet he also crows about increasing starting salaries for teachers by $7,000 since 2020 and spending $2bn on teachers\u2019 pay. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the governor of Arkansas and the pugnacious former press secretary for Donald Trump, signed a remarkable bill in March to increase minimum teacher pay in the state from $36,000 a year to $50,000 (by one measure, moving its ranking from 48th in the nation to sixth). Glenn Youngkin of Virginia was one of the first to pioneer the winning anti-CRT strategy in 2021. Yet he also proudly signed a 10% pay rise for teachers in 2022 and is pushing this year for an additional $100m in spending on teacher-retention bonuses."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some might suggest this presents a paradox. Mr Stitt argues that it is the emergence of a coherent, competing Republican agenda that can undo the narrative that Democrats are the best party for education. \u201cWe believe in merit pay,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m still not supportive of the big unions, because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing teachers a service and not focusing on the kids.\u201d In addition to higher pay for teachers in traditional public schools and safeguards to assure that there is no wokery, he says, parents should also be furnished with tax credits to send their children to private school if they wish. \u201cI\u2019m always saying let\u2019s fund the students, not the system. Let\u2019s empower parents because they know what\u2019s best for their kids.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is what is happening in other states, too. The recent pay-increase legislation in Arkansas creates a voucher scheme, establishes a merit-pay programme to reward high-performing teachers with bonuses of up to $10,000, raises standards for literacy, bans the promotion of CRT and prohibits the discussion of sex for pupils below the fifth grade (roughly age 11)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A few other factors help explain the trend. State budgets were flush after a deluge of federal dollars arrived during the covid-19 pandemic even as an unusually strong economy produced high revenues. A shortage of teachers, which remains a problem in Oklahoma, would only get worse if the state could not keep up with wages offered by its neighbours (and even the ones offered by employers such as Amazon). Schools remain the centre of many rural communities and many rural educators are Republicans; letting them flounder out of spite against potential indoctrination would be unpopular. Effective campaigning and effective governance are rather separate."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But some blur the lines. Ask Ryan Walters, the freshly elected Oklahoma superintendent of public instruction, what the biggest problem in the state\u2019s schools is and he replies without a moment\u2019s hesitation: \u201cthe left-wing mentality that education should be used to indoctrinate kids and push a perspective on them\u201d. In school districts \u201cwhere the teachers\u2019 unions have a more heavy influence\u201d, he says, \u201cyou see a much greater push for pornographic materials for conversations about transgenderism in the early grades, conversations around race that are inherently racist\u201d."}, {"role": "second", "text": "No dark sarcasm in the classroom"}, {"role": "body", "text": "After lawmakers queried Mr Walters\u2019s allegations he emailed a 56-page memo documenting books in school libraries with sexually explicit illustrations\u2014including one graphic memoir titled \u201cGender Queer\u201d. Several lawmakers, Republican and Democratic, had printed the memo and thrust it angrily at your correspondent when he visited their offices and inquired about the education superintendent. \u201cI asked for him to appear before my committee. I didn\u2019t ask for him to choose what the subject matter was,\u201d says Mark McBride, a Republican state representative and chair of the education budget subcommittee. \u201cWhy are we continuing what I would call campaign rhetoric? I can\u2019t answer that. I have no idea,\u201d says Ronny Johns, another Republican representative and a former teacher who is advocating for \u201cmore than a $2,500 pay raise\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But even Mr Walters says: \u201cI absolutely believe teachers should make more.\u201d He is adamant that this must be through merit pay, not the current rigid pay schedule that ties compensation to years of experience, which he describes as \u201csocialist\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The new policy regime is receiving a mixed reception from teachers\u2014despite the increased money. The rhetoric \u201cis like a dagger in your heart,\u201d says Katherine Bishop, president of the Oklahoma Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, who says it is harder to be a teacher today than it was before the walkout, as a result of the pandemic disruptions and the lack of personnel. \u201cWe\u2019re like King George. We\u2019re going to send fully armed battalions to show teachers our love. We\u2019re going to give them raises sometimes, but we\u2019re also going to say terrible things,\u201d says John Waldron, a Democratic state representative and former teacher in Tulsa. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Others don\u2019t like the added conditions. \u201cMy hesitation about the pay raise is it\u2019s tied to vouchers, which is just a slap in the face to those of us that are running fully public schools,\u201d says Cecilia Robinson-Woods, the superintendent of Millwood Public Schools, a small, largely African-American school district in Oklahoma City. The scrutiny and requirement that lesson plans be posted have made her teachers \u201cnervous wrecks\u201d, she says. She notes a recently passed bill that would make it easier for educators to have guns in school. \u201cThese are the same leaders that don\u2019t trust us with library books, but want to arm us?\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "What the detractors might miss, however, is the possibility that Republicans craft a new education policy that proves to be genuinely popular. Republicans are now willing to spend money on both traditional public schools and tax credits for private schools. Their new conditions\u2014that there not be any social-justice indoctrination in the classroom\u2014poll well even if they also institute onerous monitoring.
