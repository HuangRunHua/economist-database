Documentarians developed a personal and domestic style. For instance, \u201cThe Earth Is Blue as an Orange\u201d, which won many awards in 2020-21, depicted a family in a war zone filming a documentary about themselves. Feature films blossomed, too. Set in a boarding school for deaf teenagers, \u201cThe Tribe\u201d won several prizes at Cannes in 2014. \u201cFalling\u201d (2017) was a sparse, dislocated love story exploring themes of violence, corruption and identity. \u201cAtlantis\u201d (2019) was a dystopian fantasy set in a post-war Donbas."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As Daria Badior, a critic and co-curator of a film festival in Kyiv, puts it, the first response of Ukrainian film-makers to political upheaval was \u201cto make something that reflected their lives\u201d.
