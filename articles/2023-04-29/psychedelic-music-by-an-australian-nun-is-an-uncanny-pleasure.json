The vocalist is soon joined by a gently pulsing rhythm. The song, called \u201cFire\u201d, is an enchanting piece of music. It sounds vaguely like some electronic pop that was made in the 1980s, yet it is actually the work of Sister Irene O\u2019Connor, an Australian nun."}, {"role": "body", "text": "You may have heard \u201cFire\u201d, or at least a fragment of it, before. Last year it featured in \u201cKilling Eve\u201d, a hit television series, providing the soundtrack to a scene in which the show\u2019s psychopathic anti-hero, Villanelle, is baptised. James Blake, a British pop star, sampled the song on \u201cWhere\u2019s The Catch?\u201d, a track of 2019. \u201cFire\u201d has been remixed in a reggaeton style by an artist in Brazil; a Swedish metal band used to play it at the start of their concerts. In February the album on which it originally appeared, \u201cFire of God\u2019s Love\u201d, was released digitally for the first time, half a century after it came out on vinyl.

She was teaching in Singapore at a kindergarten for children with learning difficulties when, one day, she picked up a guitar and sang to the youngsters. They loved her performance, and word got around about the musical nun. She recorded several albums."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was in Singapore that Sister Irene befriended Sister Marimil Lobregat, a fellow teacher and music enthusiast. Years later the two nuns both moved to Sydney and entered the same Franciscan convent. Sister Marimil became a collaborator on \u201cFire of God\u2019s Love\u201d, handling the production and lending the music its eerie, psychedelic-folk mood. Sister Irene wrote the songs, sang the vocals and played all the instruments. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The album was first released by Philips Records, a Dutch conglomerate, in 1973. Though it didn\u2019t sell in big quantities at the time, in the decades since it has earned a cult following. In 2008 Darren Seltmann of the Avalanches, an electronic-music group, named \u201cFire of God\u2019s Love\u201d one of the best Australian albums of all time. The LP has long been a holy grail for discerning crate-diggers, who pay high prices for original vinyl copies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sister Irene recently celebrated her 90th birthday. She now lives in an old-people\u2019s home in Sydney; some proceeds from the reissue will go towards paying for her care. For now it is only available digitally, through Sister Irene\u2019s website\u2014vinyl collectors will have to wait a little longer for the 21st-century edition. Listen to the music closely, and it becomes clear that, for all its impressive sonic ingenuity, at the heart of the album is a sincere religious devotion. As \u201cFire\u201d comes to a close, Sister Irene sings: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass from death to life one day to share/God\u2019s endless life of love beyond compare.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Speaking to The Economist from a sunlit park bench, Sister Irene was surprised and happy that her distinctive music was being appreciated anew.
