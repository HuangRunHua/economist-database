The purposes listed\u2014beginning with promoting \u201cinternational monetary co-operation\u201d\u2014without a doubt would find support and agreement among the institution\u2019s 190 member countries.

Some 96 countries requested and have received IMF financing since the beginning of the pandemic. Outstanding loans or promises to lend total $300bn.

Success will require co-operation, not confrontation, and the only way a solution can emerge is through meaningful dialogue. To this end, the fund, in collaboration with the World Bank and the G20, has convened a Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable that brings creditors (including China) and borrowers together to seek consensus on standards and processes.

Is your counter- argument that the fund simply should ignore these factors, and leave them to others?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the challenge posed by geopolitical tensions and fragmentation, you seemed to recommend that the fund should become a front-line warrior in a new cold war.

I live near the Whittington (Highgate Newtown) Estate, which was built in the 1970s to fulfil this concept and continues to be a popular place to live with a high density of apartments alongside safe, pedestrian communal spaces. There are several other similar estates from the same era in London, including the Brunswick Centre and the Alexandra Road estate.
