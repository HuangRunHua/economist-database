She is already back, as the 13th director-general of Britain\u2019s most prominent business lobby group. And possibly its last. Engulfed by allegations of the worst kind of workplace misconduct and shunned by politicians and its own members, the CBI looks done for."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Newton-Smith\u2019s return was prompted by the dismissal on April 11th of Tony Danker, who had run the CBI since November 2020, for \u201cconduct [that] fell short of that expected of the director-general\u201d. Though sorry for making some staff feel \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d, Mr Danker later told the BBC his sacking was unfair. The grounds he was given, he said, included viewing employees\u2019 Instagram accounts, sending non-work messages on work platforms, inviting junior staff to one-on-one meetings and organising a private karaoke party. The CBI did not go into specifics."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The rot anyway went much further. Far graver complaints, not involving Mr Danker, had already come to light. The Guardian had reported allegations by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct and the misuse of drugs. This included a rape and an attempted assault at a party on a boat in 2019. The Guardian has since reported that another woman alleges she was raped by two male colleagues. Police are investigating potential offences."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The CBI\u2019s reputation has gone from worthy-but-dull to downright poisonous. Ministers and officials have dropped contact; so have many of the CBI\u2019s 190,000 members. Some have quit altogether, including the John Lewis Partnership and Kingfisher, two retailers; Aviva, an insurer, and the Association of British Insurers (ABI), a trade body; and NatWest, a bank.
