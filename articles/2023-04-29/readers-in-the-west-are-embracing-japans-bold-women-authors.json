Her work has struck a chord in Japan, her conservative home country. Her semi-autobiographical novel, \u201cConvenience Store Woman\u201d, won the prestigious Akutagawa literary prize in 2016. It has since been translated into more than 30 languages and sold over 1.5m copies.

In 2020 \u201cBreasts and Eggs\u201d, a novel about pregnancy and beauty standards by Kawakami Mieko, another female Japanese author, also became an international bestseller. \u201cPublishers used to ask for the next Haruki Murakami,\u201d says David Boyd, a translator who has worked on Ms Kawakami\u2019s books. \u201cNow they ask: What\u2019s going to be the next \u2018Convenience Store Woman\u2019?\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though the settings may be unfamiliar to Western readers, these books examine universal themes, such as the challenges of family life. In \u201cWeasels in the Attic\u201d (2022), a novella made up of interlinking stories, Oyamada Hiroko portrays an unhappily married couple who seek fulfilment by having a baby. \u201cIn Japan, it seems as if women are seen as incomplete unless they have a child,\u201d says Ms Oyamada. Her short story \u201cSpider Lilies\u201d explores the related obsession with breastfeeding. \u201cWhen I had a baby, I felt like my breasts were a public asset,\u201d the author says. \u201cStrangers kept asking me: \u2018Is the milk coming?\u2019\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Murata\u2019s view of motherhood is even more caustic.

In the 1970s, amid anti-war and anti-capitalist feminist movements, the child-killing mother became a popular trope in fiction by Japanese women, says Iida Yuko of Nagoya University. Novelists including Oba Minako and Kono Taeko used disturbing imagery to rebel against a view of women as baby-making machines. Bookish types hope the new overseas interest in Japanese writers will extend to this period, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the likes of Ms Murata are breaking new ground in their bold depictions of sexuality. \u201cGrowing up and dating men, I never thought women could be sexual agents,\u201d she says, noting that Japanese popular culture idealises subservient women. Her characters are aroused by things such as stuffed toys and curtains: whereas heterosexual love often turns into a \u201cmanual\u201d, intimacy with objects is more \u201ccreative\u201d, she writes in \u201cVanishing World\u201d, a sci-fi tale of a world where people breed through artificial insemination. \u201cThere\u2019s always a hierarchy between man and woman,\u201d echoes Ms Oyamada. In \u201cLost in the Zoo\u201d, a short story, she likens unhappy families to caged animals, trapped by convention. A lesbian couple, by contrast, exude an air of liberty.
