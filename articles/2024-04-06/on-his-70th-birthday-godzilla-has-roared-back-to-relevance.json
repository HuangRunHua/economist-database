Not Godzilla. Since the giant lizard made his screen debut in \u201cGodzilla\u201d, a Japanese film released in 1954, he has crashed his way through nearly 40 movies. (Guinness World Records certifies Godzilla as the longest-running movie franchise.) Nor does he shows any sign of slowing down. In December \u201cGodzilla Minus One\u201d, a Japanese film, became a box-office hit. \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire\u201d has recently hit cinemas, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "From his conception, Godzilla has symbolised the fears of his time. He was created from the wreckage of the second world war. Honda Ishiro, the writer-director of \u201cGodzilla\u201d, was haunted by the bombing of Hiroshima, the aftermath of which he witnessed first-hand. \u201cIt was said that, for the next 72 years, not a single blade of grass would grow there\u2014and that really stayed with me,\u201d he said. \u201cGodzilla represents the frightfulness of nuclear weapons.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In \u201cGodzilla\u201d, after the monster destroys a village on Odo Island, researchers conclude that he was roused from his prehistoric slumber by hydrogen-bomb testing.

The crew of a Japanese fishing boat was accidentally irradiated.

America has been producing its own Godzilla films since 1956, and Hollywood has often ignored the historical aspect of the beast\u2019s story in favour of pure action. In time Godzilla went from myth to meme. He became one of several characters in a franchise known as the \u201cMonsterVerse\u201d. Recent instalments have brought supersize lizard and enormous ape together: \u201cGodzilla x Kong\u201d is a sequel to \u201cGodzilla vs. Kong\u201d (2021)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The MonsterVerse has tended towards the absurd, but has also explored a theme implicit in the Godzilla story: the environment. In one movie Godzilla helps defeat eco-terrorists who want to unleash primitive monsters to rid Earth of the \u201cinfection\u201d of mankind. In \u201cGodzilla x Kong\u201d the monster defends an untouched natural realm.

Yet the film is not just aesthetically impressive; it is as profound as the original, and in conversation with it. Set at the end of the second world war the film follows Shikishima Koichi, a timid kamikaze pilot. When he first encounters Godzilla, at a landing strip on Odo Island, he fails to act.
