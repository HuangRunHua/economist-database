That simple question has been at the heart of nuclear strategy for almost 80 years. For Bernard Brodie, an early nuclear theorist, the bomb had created a stable balance of terror. The precise number and variety of weapons was less important than the fact that they existed. His colleagues Herman Kahn and Albert Wohlstetter disagreed. The balance was \u201cprecarious\u201d, they retorted, and required careful and continuous attention to metrics such as the relative damage that each side would suffer in a nuclear exchange and thus to the relative size and quality of their respective arsenals."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In America that debate is returning to the fore. A growing number of influential American thinkers believe that deterrence is becoming harder and could become precarious. Great-power rivalry has grown, making an intensification of nuclear competition more likely. Arms-control agreements have frayed. Amid the rising tensions, which have helped bring renewed attention to the world-changing impact of nuclear weapons, the spectre of Donald Trump looms large. His return to office could see a disruption to American alliances that prompts allies in Asia and Europe to look afresh at their own nuclear options."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whichever candidate wins November\u2019s election will preside over a nuclear complex in the midst of a 30-year, $1.5trn makeover. That involves projects as varied as designing a new warhead and cruise missile, making new plutonium pits (the fissile cores inside warheads) and building new submarines, bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "These programmes enjoy bipartisan support but were finalised in the 2010s during a different geopolitical era. One shift came with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Vladimir Putin\u2019s use of nuclear threats to deter Western involvement there. Another was the growth of China\u2019s arsenal from fewer than 300 warheads in 2019 to 500 today, and as many as 1,000 by the end of the decade, according to the Pentagon. As a result, America increasingly worries about facing two big nuclear rivals at once."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nuclear planners now contemplate problems that would have seemed irrelevant and ghoulish just a decade ago. \u201cHow much strategic value to the United States is there in having the capacity to conduct a counter-nuclear attack against a second nuclear power after conducting and suffering a large nuclear strike by the first?\u201d asks a recent paper by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the labs involved in nuclear modernisation. If America were to wage a nuclear war with China, say, might Russia \u201ccross\u2026the nuclear threshold in order to strike a decisive blow to defeat a hated enemy and gain a dominant position\u201d? "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nuclear sceptics argue that these challenges have been exaggerated. America\u2019s arsenal remains ten times larger than that of China. Nor does the war in Ukraine offer unalloyed support for more nukes. \u201cThe strategic nuclear balance has not appeared to play a significant role in this crisis,\u201d points out Francis Gavin, a nuclear historian at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt is notable how little discussion there has been over the state, readiness and size of the two largest nuclear powers\u2019 forces.\u201d That might suggest America would cope just fine even if Russia and China were to outnumber it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet sceptics are on the back foot. In October a bipartisan congressional commission, which included officials who had served in both the Obama and Trump administrations, warned that \u201cnuclear force sizing and composition must account for the possibility of combined aggression from Russia and China.\u201d America would need to be capable of \u201csimultaneously deterring both countries\u201d. In short, it required a larger and more diverse arsenal. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That appetite is already influencing American policy. The Trump administration initiated work on a new submarine-launched nuclear-armed cruise missile, known by the acronym SLCM-N, arguing that it would provide more flexible nuclear options. The Biden administration sought to cancel the project, arguing that it was expensive and unnecessary. Congress cast aside those objections to establish SLCM-N as a \u201cprogramme of record\u201d\u2014the slate of established projects, like the new ICBM\u2014last year.

Not bad for an unwanted nuke."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Don\u2019t you understand\u2026"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For advocates of a more muscular nuclear posture, that is just the start. In a recent report, Robert Peters and Ryan Tully of the Heritage Foundation, a pro-Trump think-tank, lay out a menu of options. America, they argue, should accelerate the production of plutonium pits. Existing ICBMs, which carry only one warhead, should be modified to carry more. Their replacement, the Sentinel, should not just sit in silos but potentially be designed to scoot around on roads\u2014something that would represent a huge (and expensive) change in America\u2019s nuclear posture. Frank Miller, a veteran of American nuclear policy, argues that the country needs around 3,500 deployed weapons, compared with the 1,670 it has today within the constraints of the New START treaty, which limits the number of missiles, bombers and total warheads deployed by America and Russia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Mr Biden is re-elected, most of these ideas will surely languish. Even under Mr Trump there are obstacles to a nuclear spree. \u201cFour years is a very short time in the nuclear-modernisation arena,\u201d says Rose Gottemoeller, a former diplomat who served as America\u2019s top arms-control official. She says that Mr Trump would struggle to reopen the programme of record without worsening the existing cost overruns and delays.

America does not have the ability to produce vast numbers of new warheads. But it has around 1,900 nuclear weapons in reserve (see chart). It could roughly double its deployed arsenal by \u201cuploading\u201d these to current missiles and other delivery systems. Russia could surge by 57%, adding just under 1,000. Today this is constrained by New START. Last year Russia withdrew from the treaty\u2019s inspection regime, in a sign that its days are numbered. The bipartisan commission is urging the air force and navy to practise uploading warheads from now to 2026, when the treaty expires. If it does indeed lapse, both countries can then do it for real."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Another option, favoured by some of Mr Trump\u2019s advisers in private, would be to resume explosive nuclear testing. America, Russia and China have not conducted such tests since the 1990s, relying instead on computer modelling. Mr Trump, in his first term, accused China and Russia of covertly carrying out \u201clow yield\u201d tests and considered a change in policy. In recent years there have been signs of tunnelling, new facilities and heightened traffic at test sites in America, Russia and China. That probably reflects each country hedging against a potential shift by another. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "None of this is a foregone conclusion. Mr Trump \u201cmight very well pursue arms control with Russia and China to show he\u2019s a dealmaker\u201d, suggests Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, pointing to the former president\u2019s theatrical meetings with Kim Jong Un, North Korea\u2019s dictator, in 2018 and 2019. \u201cThe big question\u201d, says Mr Lewis (who is also the author of a chilling novel on a nuclear conflict with North Korea), \u201cis whether Trump would buck the Republican Party on missile defence.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "China and Russia operate limited national missile-defence systems. They have long argued that America\u2019s more ambitious efforts, which expanded after George W. Bush withdrew from a 1972 US-Soviet treaty, undermine deterrence by allowing America to conduct a first strike and then block any retaliation. That has probably encouraged Russia and China to build larger and, in Russia\u2019s case, more diverse, nuclear arsenals. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "America has pressed on regardless. In exchange for curbing the development of missile defences, it could perhaps ask Russia to include its large arsenal of tactical or \u201cnon-strategic\u201d nukes as part of any future arms-control deal and demand that China sign on too. But in January Mr Trump publicly endorsed missile defences, invoking the success of Israel\u2019s (completely unrelated) Iron Dome system. And putting these on the negotiating table would cause internal tension in a future administration, warns Mr Lewis: \u201cIt tugs at two parts of Trump\u2019s self-image: his view of himself as a consummate dealmaker and his enthusiasm for high-tech weapons.\u201d"}, {"role": "second", "text": "\u2026what I\u2019m trying to say"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Mr Trump were to embrace the hawks\u2019 agenda, it would send ripples through Moscow and Beijing. Russia is probably already preparing for the collapse of New START, says Kristin Ven Bruusgaard of the Norwegian Intelligence School, and would use any new American plans or weapons for \u201cpropaganda bluster\u201d. However, Russia has its own financial and material constraints. The war in Ukraine could cost it $132bn by the end of this year, estimates the RAND Corporation, an American think-tank. The country is not short of warheads. But new delivery systems are overdue and over budget. \u201cIn capability terms,\u201d says Professor Ven Bruusgaard, \u201cmy impression is that the Russians are more or less racing as fast as they can.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "China has more fiscal headroom, but a shortage of plutonium might constrain its arsenal over the next decade or so. And the rush to build weapons might also have led to \u201ccutting corners\u201d, suggests Tong Zhao, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, another think-tank, alluding to reports of faulty silo doors and water-filled missiles. Its build-up was also initiated before its economy began to slow down last year. \u201cChina\u2019s current nuclear expansion might be pushing its limits,\u201d concludes Mr Zhao. The upshot of all this is that any arms race is likely to be slow and halting, rather than fast and furious. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "For America\u2019s allies, the calculation is rather different. European members of NATO and several Asian countries, including Japan and South Korea, are protected by America\u2019s nuclear weapons, under \u201cextended deterrence\u201d. Many would welcome Mr Trump building more nuclear weapons or newer ones. The SLCM-N, for instance, has many supporters in Europe and Asia because some allies believe it would help America respond to low-level nuclear use by Russia or China in kind without resorting to strategic weapons like ICBMs, which would trigger a larger nuclear exchange and thus lack credibility as a deterrent in such circumstances."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But a nuclear build-up would be little consolation to allies if it were accompanied by a dramatic change in the nature of their alliances. Though Mr Trump recently said he intended to remain in NATO (provided America\u2019s partners paid their \u201cfair share\u201d), European and Asian allies alike wonder whether he would come to their aid. Moreover, North Korea\u2019s acquisition of ICBMs makes American cities vulnerable in a way they previously were not, while the growth of China\u2019s arsenal means that America would suffer more damage in any nuclear exchange than in the past. That would worry even an ally-hugging president, let alone Mr Trump."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Can\u2019t you feel the fears\u2026"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Biden\u2019s solution to this problem has been to double down on reassurance. He has deepened consultation with Japan and South Korea on nuclear issues and in July 2023 sent a nuclear-armed submarine to make a public port call in South Korea for the first time since the 1980s. Even so, Japan has stockpiled plenty of plutonium and would have the necessary technical expertise to build a nuclear device. South Korea\u2019s hedging is much starker: it is the only non-nuclear-armed country in the world to have developed submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which could serve as a delivery platform for any future bomb."}, {"role": "body", "text": "During Mr Trump\u2019s first term South Korea\u2019s nuclear debate played out under the presidency of Moon Jae-in, a dove who took North Korea at its word on disarmament, points out Jennifer Ahn of the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank in New York. Mr Moon\u2019s administration gave short shrift to the idea of bringing back American tactical nuclear weapons, withdrawn in 1991, let alone developing indigenous ones. His successor, the \u201cconservative and deterrence-focused\u201d Yoon Suk-yeol, she notes, is a different matter.

Yet more than 70% of South Koreans remain in favour of acquiring nuclear weapons. If Mr Trump were to renew his quixotic effort to strike a deal with Mr Kim by reversing America\u2019s policy of \u201cdenuclearisation\u201d, legitimating North Korea as a nuclear power, or if Mr Kim were to resume nuclear tests\u2014he has not conducted one in seven years\u2014that could also intensify South Korean nuclear ambitions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Europe\u2019s predicament is different.

That would risk the survival of the remaining missiles, which serve as a deterrent against subsequent strikes on Britain itself. One option would be to maintain two boats on patrol, but that would require a total fleet of five rather than four.

Extended deterrence is perverse: attack my ally and I might nuke you, exposing myself to nuclear retaliation that I would not otherwise have faced.
