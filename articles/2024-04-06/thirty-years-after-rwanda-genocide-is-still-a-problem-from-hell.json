Annan refused permission and ordered him to do nothing that \u201cmight lead to the use of force\u201d.

In 2005 the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted the principle that all countries have a \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d (R2P) people from genocide and war crimes, by force if necessary.

Six months before the genocide in Rwanda, America pulled out of Somalia after 18 of its commandos were killed in Mogadishu, the capital.

The UN\u2019s charter, signed in 1945, forbade meddling in \u201cmatters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state\u201d. Though its Security Council could authorise force, this was intended as a response to aggression, not to prevent atrocities. Newly independent African countries had had their fill of colonial powers trampling on their sovereignty. In 1963, when they formed the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the members committed themselves to \u201cnon-interference\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rwanda shook that belief. In 2003 the African Union (AU), the OAU\u2019s successor, gave itself the power to intervene to prevent grave crimes.

In a speech in Chicago in 1999, Mr Blair outlined a doctrine of just wars \u201cbased not on any territorial ambitions but on values\u201d. He insisted the world could not simply allow mass murder. That doctrine has since become policy. In 2018 the British government reserved the right to prevent atrocities without the Security Council\u2019s authorisation, if its paralysis would lead to \u201cgrave consequences\u201d for civilian populations."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Angels with F-16s"}, {"role": "body", "text": "All this converged into a current of thought known as \u201cliberal interventionism\u201d.

An international commission subsequently judged the bombing campaign \u201cillegal\u201d but nonetheless \u201clegitimate\u201d because there was no other way to stop the killing of civilians. Yet many were unsettled that powerful countries were arrogating the authority to bomb others in the name of human rights.

In 2000 he asked: \u201cIf humanitarian intervention is indeed an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica?\u201d The answer was R2P, which tried to reconcile the aspirations of liberal interventionists with the worries of weak states. The R2P resolution, passed unanimously by the UN in 2005, held that countries had a responsibility to intervene, but only when authorised by the Security Council. A British historian, Sir Martin Gilbert, called it \u201cthe most significant adjustment to national sovereignty in 360 years\u201d. That goes too far, thinks Gareth Evans, a former foreign minister of Australia and one of the founders of R2P. Nonetheless, he calls it \u201ca wildly successful enterprise\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Evans argues that R2P created a new norm: no official today can openly shrug off genocide for reasons of state, as Henry Kissinger, then America\u2019s secretary of state, did while cosying up to Cambodia\u2019s Khmers Rouges in 1975. Meanwhile, since Rwanda almost all UN forces have been ordered to protect civilians\u2014though they are seldom given enough troops to do so, says Alan Doss, who ran such missions in Liberia and Congo. Critics counter that R2P creates no binding obligations on countries. The doctrine is a \u201cslogan...enthusiastically avowed by states but one devoid of substance\u201d, says Aidan Hehir of the University of Westminster.

Crucially, the council\u2019s three rotating African members (Gabon, Nigeria and South Africa) broke with the AU and supported the resolution. But not everyone was enthusiastic. John Bolton, a Republican former diplomat, had called R2P \u201ca gauzy, limitless doctrine\u201d whose greatest danger was not that it might fail, but that it might succeed and lead to ever more foreign entanglements.

At first the bombing in Libya worked, preventing a massacre of civilians in Benghazi, a city in the country\u2019s east. Yet Britain and France then stretched the authority granted by the Security Council and toppled Muammar Qaddafi, Libya\u2019s dictator. The subsequent civil war destabilised the entire region. That dampened the West\u2019s enthusiasm for intervention. It also revived \u201clong-held suspicions of the motivations behind Western interventions in Africa\u201d, argues Karen Smith of Leiden University, a former UN special adviser on R2P. African supporters of the doctrine, such as South Africa, turned into sceptics. \u201cGood intentions do not automatically shape good outcomes,\u201d Ramesh Thakur, a former UN official and an architect of R2P, wrote after the effort in Libya went sour. \u201cOn the contrary, there is no humanitarian crisis so grave that an outside military intervention cannot make it worse.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For many, mission creep in Libya was the original sin that undermined R2P. \u201cIt\u2019s when things started to fall apart,\u201d laments Mr Evans. Yet even had the Libyan campaign succeeded, the doctrine would probably have stumbled. Western publics were tiring of the decade-long \u201cwar on terror\u201d and unsuccessful efforts at building liberal democracies in countries that did not seem to want them. \u201cWe now have a generation of politicians who have been shaped by the failure of intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d says the ICG\u2019s Mr Gowan."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That became clear in 2013 when Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, dropped nerve gas on civilians.

Inaction, it turned out, has costs too. By 2023 Syria\u2019s civil war had claimed perhaps 350,000 lives and displaced roughly half of the population, sending waves of refugees into neighbouring countries and Europe.

Between 2011 and 2022 it vetoed 17 resolutions on Syria, and it has blocked any action on Ukraine.

The Security Council has proved ineffective, with America, China and Russia blocking each other\u2019s resolutions (although on March 25th America allowed one to pass, calling for a ceasefire and the release of Hamas\u2019s hostages). But several countries have turned to international courts. South Africa asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague to order Israel to halt its military operations, invoking the Genocide Convention, which Israel has signed. It also filed complaints at the International Criminal Court (ICC), a different court in The Hague that can arraign individuals. (This was quite a turnabout: South Africa had flirted with quitting the ICC to avoid honouring its arrest warrants.) While the trial at the icj continues, it has ordered Israel to take steps including providing humanitarian aid, on the basis that it is \u201cplausible\u201d that it is breaching the Genocide Convention.

The ICJ has no jurisdiction over war crimes other than genocide, which encourages complainants to allege genocide even when the facts do not support it.

America says the allegation of genocide is \u201cmeritless\u201d, and Britain says South Africa\u2019s decision to bring the case was \u201cwrong and provocative\u201d and that Israel\u2019s actions cannot be described as genocide. For its part, China, usually a foe of international courts\u2019 ordering countries around, has opportunistically decided it likes the claims against Israel.
