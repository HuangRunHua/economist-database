This province, part of the industrial rustbelt, exemplifies the problems besetting China\u2019s economy. Its birth rate is the lowest in the country. House prices in its biggest city are falling. The province\u2019s GDP grew by only 2.6% in 2023. Worse, its nominal GDP, before adjusting for inflation, barely grew at all, suggesting it is in the grip of deep deflation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Never fear: Mr Xi has a plan. On his visit, he urged his provincial audience to cultivate \u201cnew productive forces\u201d. That phrase has since appeared scores of times in state newspapers and at official gatherings. It was highlighted in last month\u2019s \u201ctwo sessions\u201d, annual meetings of China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament and its advisory body. In the preface of a new book on the subject, Wang Xianqing of Peking University likens the term to \u201creform and opening up\u201d, the formula that encapsulated China\u2019s embrace of market forces after 1978. Those words \u201cshine\u201d even today, he wrote, implying that \u201cnew productive forces\u201d will have similar staying power."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What does the phrase mean? Chinese officials are hunting for ways to power the country\u2019s economy. For years its productive forces drew on the mobilisation of labour and accumulation of capital. Its workforce grew by 100m people from 1996 to 2015. Its stock of capital rose from 258% of GDP in 2001 to 349% two decades later, according to the Asia Productivity Organisation. After the global financial crisis of 2007-09, capital accumulation often took the form of new property or infrastructure."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But China\u2019s workforce is now shrinking and demand for property has slumped: fewer people are moving to China\u2019s cities, speculative gains on real estate are no longer assured and potential homebuyers are reluctant to buy flats in advance in case distressed developers run out of cash before building is complete. The property downturn has hurt consumer confidence and deprived local governments of crucial revenues from land sales. Even after China abandoned its strict covid-19 controls, the economic recovery has been muted and uneven. Spending has not been strong enough to fully employ China\u2019s existing productive forces. As a consequence, according to one measure, deflation has persisted for three quarters in a row."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At China\u2019s stage of development, economies typically pivot towards services. Yet the government\u2019s heart lies elsewhere. The pandemic boosted demand for China\u2019s manufactured goods, from surgical masks to exercise bikes. America\u2019s export controls on \u201cchokepoint technologies\u201d have created a need for homegrown alternatives, from lithography machines to aviation-grade stainless steel. China\u2019s 14th five-year plan, which spans 2021-25, promised to maintain manufacturing\u2019s share of GDP, which had declined from almost a third in 2006 to just over a quarter in 2020."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240406_FNC159.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "In its quest for a sophisticated, but self-contained, manufacturing system, China employs a variety of helpful policies. Its Ministry of Education, for example, recently approved a new undergraduate concentration in high-end semiconductor science and engineering.

That will require it to upgrade traditional industries, break foreign strangleholds on existing technologies and forge a new path in industries of tomorrow. Although the central government\u2019s ambition is impressive, even unsettling, it cannot succeed without the help of local governments, which are short of cash, and private entrepreneurs, who are short of confidence. As such, the new slogan may betray a damaging hyperopia\u2014long-sightedness that is blinding the leadership to more immediate economic concerns.

Marx, meanwhile, noted that when new productive forces achieve sufficient weight in the economy, they have the capacity to remake the social order: \u201cThe handmill gives you society with the feudal lord,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist.\u201d New productive forces, then, can be a big deal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In presenting the concept, Mr Xi has said that the test for new productive forces will be improvements in \u201ctotal factor productivity\u201d, a term lifted not from Marx, but from mainstream economics.

In mixing Marxist and neoclassical concepts, new productive forces are a \u201cstrange hybrid beast\u201d, says Mr Naughton. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to Mr Xi, the new productive forces will flow from the application of science and technology to production. The phrase is a signal that China\u2019s technology push should be even more ambitious than it is today, and more tightly integrated into economic production. China\u2019s leaders have promised a \u201cwhole of nation\u201d effort to boost technological self-reliance.

It also identified 16 \u201cmegaprojects\u201d, such as building China\u2019s own large passenger aircraft and landing a probe on the moon.

Rather than pick a miscellany of emerging industries, China\u2019s new strategy emphasised this cluster of mutually reinforcing technologies. China aimed to become a \u201cworld power\u201d in innovation by the middle of this century. By 2020 it was spending almost 2.9trn yuan ($420bn, or 2.8% of GDP) on science and technology, according to Rhodium Group, a consultancy.

According to Jie Mao of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and his co-authors, China\u2019s science-and-technology policies from 2000 to 2012 boosted productivity most in industries in ferment, rather than in those that had reached maturity either at home or abroad.
