They kicked and punched her. \u201cI ran as fast as I could, thinking to myself, \u2018This is my day, this is how I die\u2019,\u201d recalls Kwagala, a trans woman whose name we have changed for her safety. When the police arrived they locked her up for three days and charged her under Uganda\u2019s Anti-Homosexuality Act, which became law last May. Her attackers went free; she faces life in prison if convicted. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "On April 3rd the country\u2019s constitutional court upheld the core provisions of the law. Those include long prison sentences for \u201cpromoting homosexuality\u201d and the death penalty for \u201caggravated homosexuality\u201d, including for anyone deemed a serial offender. The judges did strike down some sections, such as a duty to report gay people to the police. But they argued that the law reflects Uganda\u2019s history, traditions and culture, likening their reasoning to that of America\u2019s Supreme Court when it overturned abortion rights in 2022. The judges leant on \u201cpublic sentiments and vague cultural-values arguments\u201d rather than upholding human rights, says Nicholas Opiyo, lead counsel for the petitioners. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ten years ago the same Ugandan court struck down an anti-gay law on procedural grounds. This time activists had challenged the act on both process and substance, and lost. The decision contrasts with court rulings in Botswana in 2019 and Mauritius in 2023, where judges decriminalised gay sex. It will send ripples across Africa, including in Ghana, where President Nana Akufo-Addo is under pressure to sign into law a recent anti-gay bill."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Africa\u2019s anti-gay reforms are not driven by presidents, who are wary of the diplomatic fallout, but by ambitious lawmakers and religious leaders, sometimes with friends in right-wing American groups. Although Uganda\u2019s president, Yoweri Museveni, makes homophobic remarks in public and has done nothing to stop the law, allies of his have privately told Western diplomats of their reservations. That could be because America has imposed visa restrictions on Ugandan officials, warned business of the reputational risks of operating in Uganda, and removed duty-free access for its exports. The World Bank has suspended new loans."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For LGBT people in Uganda, where 94% of citizens say they would not want a gay neighbour, the law has made a bad situation worse. They have been evicted, sacked, outed, threatened, assaulted, arrested and subjected to forced anal examinations. Rights groups recorded 300-plus cases of abuse in the first eight months of last year alone. Much of the hostility comes from ordinary Ugandans who have been \u201cradicalised into hatred\u201d, says Frank Mugisha, a gay-rights activist who was a petitioner in the court case."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kwagala just wants to live in peace. After she was charged, her father disowned her. She is barred from family funerals. Her landlord has closed her beer joint. \u201cMy whole life has changed because of this law,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d \u25a0"}], "id": 29}
