The drivers say they would waste little time in moving the protesters aside were the police not there. Huddled around a barrel fire, the farmers say they are only protecting their economic future; they do not want to be undercut by \u201cunder-regulated\u201d Ukrainian grain.

At the start of the war, when Ukraine lost access to its deep-water ports in the Black Sea, the EU temporarily exempted Ukrainian lorry drivers from a permit system that restricts movement in and out of the bloc. That upset Polish drivers, who had dominated the local freight business. Meanwhile a suspension of import duties and quotas on Ukrainian farm goods, produced by larger, more efficient outfits, posed competition to small Polish farmsteads, already pinched by EU environmental laws. A slump in world grain prices, plus politicking ahead of Polish local elections in April, heightened the tension."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240406_EUM984.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 587.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The protests have cost Ukraine hundreds of millions of dollars in lost farm and freight business.

One protest banner appealed to Mr Putin to \u201crestore order\u201d, an unlikely message in Poland but one that generated a lot of media heat. There may be links between Russia and some members of Poland\u2019s hard-right Confederation party, which played a role in the earlier protests. Andriy Cherniak, a spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s military-intelligence agency, says the Kremlin is trying to work on whatever level it can. \u201cWe see it very clearly and we follow it.

At the start of the war Poland and Ukraine were united as blood brothers against a common enemy.

Many Ukrainians see Poles as impeding their survival. Confusion and distrust reign.
