We aren\u2019t talking about what he\u2019s gotten done the last four years.\u201d She then goes on to list half a dozen reasons why Mr Biden\u2019s re-election is crucial, starting with the environment, women\u2019s reproductive rights, the economy, health care and then finally, how Donald Trump is \u201csplitting Americans apart\u201d with his violent rhetoric. \u201cIt\u2019s more important now than it\u2019s ever been to turn out the votes,\u201d she concludes. \u201cGround Zero is right here right now.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Dingell was speaking at the opening of one of 30 campaign offices that Mr Biden\u2019s campaign will soon have operating across the Wolverine State, a decisive swing state during the past two presidential elections. In 2016 Mr Trump won Michigan with a margin of just 0.3%. In 2020 Mr Biden took it back for the Democrats by 2.8%. State Democratic officials are confident that they can repeat the trick this year, and they cite a remarkable campaigning machine built since 2017 as evidence. \u201cWe are organising and talking to voters all the time,\u201d says Lavora Barnes, the Democratic chairwoman. But Ms Dingell\u2019s warning rings true too. Michigan is thus a good place to take the pulse of Mr Biden\u2019s campaign. The president is running a traditional playbook, while Mr Trump\u2019s approach to electioneering is as unconventional as ever."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Barnes is right that Democrats have a significant organisational advantage over their opponents. Nationwide Mr Biden\u2019s campaign committee has raised $129m to $96m raised by Mr Trump, and the cash is flowing into Michigan. As well as opening offices, the party is hiring staffers at pace. Phenomenally peppy 20-somethings are moving from all over the country to take up campaign jobs. An army of pensioners with lots of free time is already equipped with yard signs and bumper stickers to distribute to their neighbours. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "By contrast, Mr Trump\u2019s campaign is far less visible. On April 2nd the former president held a modest rally in Grand Rapids, attended mostly by journalists and local Republican officials. But the campaign is only now \u201cputting in place the building blocks\u201d of its organisation, says Pete Hoekstra, the party chairman. \u201cWe are not counting offices,\u201d he says, when asked if any have opened yet. For much of the past year, Michigan Republicans have been in disarray. In January members voted to oust their chair, Kristina Karamo, a vocal proponent of the theory that the 2020 election was rigged, over complaints that she was mismanaging the party and its finances. In the end it took a lawsuit to get her to step down. At one point last year a dispute between two party officials ended in a physical fight, with a county chairman apparently complaining that a fellow activist had \u201ckicked me in my balls\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet a ground-game advantage does not guarantee that Mr Biden will win the state. Most evidence from political science suggests that door-knocking has at most a marginal effect, generally by boosting turnout. It certainly cannot replace a persuasive message. The early campaign suggests that Democrats may have too many points to make and have yet to craft a unified argument."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Take for example the talking points of Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan\u2019s popular Democratic governor. Asked at another office opening, this one in Livingston County, a Republican-leaning suburb north-west of Detroit, what she expects the message of the election to be, at first she replies frankly: \u201cEverything\u2019s about the economy.\u201d But then she adds: \u201cOur ability to make our own decisions about our body, when and whether or not to bear a child, that is the most important economic decision a woman will make over the course of her lifetime.\u201d In addition, she continues, education and climate change matter, as does \u201conshoring supply chains\u201d. These things, she says, are \u201call going to be absolutely central to what\u2019s on voters\u2019 minds.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The breadth of the message reflects the challenge Democrats face in Michigan, particularly at presidential level. To beat Mr Trump, the party needs to make sure that committed Democrats turn out in large numbers, particularly in the state\u2019s urban strongholds in Detroit and Ann Arbor. Already that base is rather divided. It includes college students, black blue-collar workers, white professionals, the liberal elderly and the more unionised of the white working class. A few older activists in Livingston mentioned unprompted their disdain for digital campaigning, arguing that it doesn\u2019t persuade anyone new. By contrast, young voters are deeply online. \u201cI really think that a lot more people now get their beliefs based off of, like, Instagram and TikTok,\u201d says Jacob Welch, the president of Michigan\u2019s College Democrats organisation. He worries that Mr Biden\u2019s support for Israel in Gaza is putting young voters off."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What unites the base most is, as Mr Welch puts it, that they all \u201cdespise Donald Trump\u201d. But the party also needs to win over at least a few people who might be tempted to vote for him. Ms Barnes says that one of the reasons Hillary Clinton lost the state in 2016 was that she prioritised making sure solid Democrats turned out to vote, and neglected trying to persuade people on the fence. \u201cThere was a lot of focus on just turnout,\u201d particularly in big cities, she says. Now they are trying to reach areas Democrats don\u2019t usually touch\u2014hence the opening of offices in places like Livingston. \u201cI think that there are a lot of fair-minded, thoughtful folks who have voted Republican in the past,\u201d she says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The tricky thing is that those voters may require different messages, and sometimes they pull across each other. The voters Mr Biden needs to tempt away are also a diverse mix. They include wealthier, more socially liberal suburban Republicans but also blue-collar workers. Jacob Hilliker, the Michigan representative for LiUNA, a large trade union that represents mostly workers in the construction trade, and which has endorsed Mr Biden, says the case for Mr Biden for his union members is that \u201che\u2019s done nothing but make it rain jobs like nobody has before\u201d. When asked about the appeal of culture-war issues, such as abortion or IVF, he demurs. \u201cI have my personal views on abortion rights, guns, the right to hunt in Michigan,\u201d he says, without specifying what they are. \u201cWe are here to fight for jobs.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Trump\u2019s message, by contrast, is crude but simple. \u201cYou\u2019re under an invasion,\u201d he told his audience in Grand Rapids. Flanked by a gaggle of sheriffs, and two television screens showing a chart of border crossings, he argued that Joe Biden is letting criminal \u201cillegal aliens\u201d and useless Chinese electric cars flood into Michigan. (He said the crime rate in Venezuela has fallen, which is true, and suggested it is because so many wrong-uns have been sent to America, which is not.) To fix this, he proposes to whack monstrous trade tariffs on Mexico, to stop Chinese firms building cars there, and to \u201cbegin the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country\u201d. For good measure he also added that he would give police officers accused of wrongdoing complete immunity from litigation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Shawn Fain, the leader of the United Auto Workers union, says Mr Trump \u201cis like the third-grader running for class president, you know, he wants to give a free candy machine to everybody in the class.\u201d He points out that when the union went on strike last year, Mr Biden visited them, whereas Mr Trump, as president, shunned a strike in 2019. But even Mr Fain admits he sometimes has to work to persuade his members. \u201cYou can claim you love Trump or whatever the hell your reasoning is. And if you do that, so be it. I feel for you. But at the end of the day, facts are facts,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s just flat-out a con man.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Biden\u2019s best hope is to pull all these strands together over the next seven months. In Livingston County, Dan Luria, the county party vice-chairman, adds his own ideas. Mr Biden, he says, ought to \u201creappropriate the concept of freedom\u201d. Freedom, he says, ties everything together\u2014from reproductive rights to the economy. Also, he adds, you can put out a lot of American flags. That is one bit of advice the Biden campaign is sure to follow. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with The , our daily newsletter with fast analysis of the most important electoral stories, and Checks and Balance, a weekly note from our Lexington columnist that examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 20}
