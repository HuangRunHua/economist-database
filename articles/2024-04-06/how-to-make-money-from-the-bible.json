When deciding which one to endorse this Easter, Donald Trump chose the King James version, widely considered to be one of the greatest works of English literature of the 17th century. Or rather, he chose a modern repackaging of it dubbed the \u201cGod Bless the USA Bible\u201d. This includes in one volume the American constitution, the lyrics of a country song called \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d and the scriptures. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cAll Americans need the Bible in their home, and I have many. It\u2019s my favourite book,\u201d intoned Mr Trump in a promotional video. \u201cReligion is so important,\u201d he added. \u201cWe must make America pray again.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And, tacitly, pay again: the new book costs $59.99 (plus postage). Mr Trump is not selling it directly, but receives royalties with each purchase, according to the New York Times. Thus, he has entered the highly competitive business of trying to make a buck from the holy book. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is a new kind of venture for Mr Trump, whose previous offerings have tended to be flashier: gold-finished Trump sneakers for $399, an enticing Trump cologne for $99. The Bible, far from being a luxury object, inveighs against wealth. It tells of the life of a man who said things like \u201cBlessed are the poor\u201d and \u201cLove your enemies.\u201d Such sentiments are not easily mistaken for those of Mr Trump, which include \u201cPart of the beauty of me is that I am very rich\u201d and \u201cThe worst thing a man can do is go bald.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The market in religious publishing is thriving in America: the recent StatShot Annual Report from the Association of American Publishers found that revenues of religious presses had risen 7% in the first ten months of 2023, to $674m. A portion of that might defray at least some of Mr Trump\u2019s sizeable legal expenses, but this is a very unusual market, with obstacles for new entrants. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The biggest is that many suppliers insist on giving its most popular product away for nothing. The Gideons, a charity founded in 1899, have placed 2.5bn Bibles and New Testaments in hotels, hospitals and domestic-violence shelters around the world\u2014roughly one for every Christian man, woman and child. Weary travellers yearning for gospel truths can simply reach into a bedside drawer and find some. Other groups have posted the entire Bible online, so the faithful can search for their favourite verses. Against such unfair competition, can Mr Trump compete?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Probably, for several reasons. First, the revered text he is touting is not subject to copyright\u2014a concept that did not exist when the King James Bible was first published in 1611. So he is demanding a high price for a text whose long-dead authors do not need paying. Never mind scribbling notes in the margins of the books of the minor prophets; the profit margins on each copy of this book should be major. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "None of that will matter if no one buys the God Bless the USA Bible. But it has two celebrity endorsements: Lee Greenwood, the country star who sings \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d, is involved, too. And Mr Trump is pushing the tome during a bitter election campaign, to a vast number of followers, many of whom are passionate both about scripture and about supporting the former president against his fiendish enemies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Others in the devotional publishing industry have faced the same challenge as Mr Trump\u2014how to refresh a blockbuster written thousands of years ago\u2014and come up with even more creative solutions. They cannot commission sequels by living authors, as the literary estates of Agatha Christie and Ian Fleming have done to produce new Hercule Poirot and James Bond stories. But they can commission new translations (a huge task) or tailor versions for specific audiences. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Thus from Zondervan, the Christian arm of HarperCollins, you can buy the \u201cBoys Bible\u201d (\u201cgross and gory stuff you never knew was in the Bible\u201d). From a smaller German outfit, there is the \u201cBiker Bible\u201d (\u201cthe whole New Testament and life stories of bikers\u201d). The Bible is long and confusing: many modern readers yearn for shortcuts to passages that might be especially relevant, and commentaries to aid comprehension. Others seek whimsy: you can buy the \u201cMother\u2019s Bible\u201d (it\u2019s pink), or Bibles in regional dialects (a Glaswegian one opens with \u201cIn the Beginnin\u2019\u201d). There are even scriptures in fictitious tongues such as Klingon, from \u201cStar Trek\u201d, or Quenya, invented by J.R.R. Tolkien. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such experimentation is much easier with the Bible than it is with the Koran, and much easier today than in previous centuries. In the 16th century the scholar William Tyndale translated the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into English, in a way that displeased the church. He was later burned at the stake for heresy. The church was less tolerant of novelty in those days, and created literal ghostwriters. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Since many people take the Bible literally, careful proofreading is essential. In 1631 printers in London accidentally left the word \u201cnot\u201d out of the seventh commandment, thus rendering it as \u201cThou shalt commit adultery.\u201d This delighted many readers, but not the authorities. The printers were hit with ruinous fines and lost their licence. The \u201cWicked Bible\u201d subsequently became a collector\u2019s item; surviving copies are now valued at tens of thousands of dollars. Whether future generations will treasure Mr Trump\u2019s Bible so dearly remains to be seen. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}, {"role": "body", "text": "G"}], "id": 64}
