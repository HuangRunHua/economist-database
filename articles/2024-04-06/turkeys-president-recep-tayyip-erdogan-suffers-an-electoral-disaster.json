It won big victories in the country\u2019s largest cities, surging past the ruling Justice and Development (AK) party nationwide and handing Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country\u2019s president, a stinging rebuke. The Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) got 37.8% of the overall vote, compared with 35.5% for AK. That figure masked landslide wins in the big cities. In Istanbul, the biggest prize, Ekrem Imamoglu, the city\u2019s CHP mayor, coasted to another term. He got 51.1% of the vote, compared with 39.6% for his AK rival, Murat Kurum, a former urban-affairs minister."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWhat message did the people give our opponents, the government and the president?\u201d asked Mr Imamoglu, standing on his campaign bus to celebrate the victory. \u201cTayyip, resign!\u201d chanted part of the crowd. Mr Imamoglu, however, sounded more conciliatory. \u201cThere will be no booing\u2026The era of partisanship is over.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Erdogan\u2019s job is safe. But the outcome in Istanbul was a blow to Turkey\u2019s strongman, who had been determined to win back Istanbul, which he and AK had run for a quarter of a century until Mr Imamoglu\u2019s surprise victory in 2019. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even more striking were the results elsewhere. \u201cTsunami\u201d, an Imamoglu adviser crowed on X. Only ten months after a poor showing in the general elections, when it blew a golden chance to unseat Mr Erdogan, the CHP handed AK its worst defeat in its 22-year history. The results again confounded the pollsters. Many had expected the CHP to do well in the cities. But none expected it to top 30% nationwide. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Ankara, the country\u2019s capital and its second-biggest city, the CHP\u2019s incumbent mayor, Mansur Yavas, trounced AK\u2019s candidate by nearly 29 percentage points. In Izmir, Turkey\u2019s third city, the CHP\u2019s man won by 12 points. For the first time in decades the opposition also made major inroads in the country\u2019s conservative heartland, AK\u2019s power-base. \u201cThe electoral map of Turkey has been transformed,\u201d said Evren Balta of Ozyegin University. Mr Erdogan acknowledged that the outcome marked \u201ca turning point\u201d but pledged to bounce back at the general elections in 2028. \u201cWe will correct our mistakes.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Imamoglu\u2019s victory was a far cry from his win in 2019, when he edged out his AK foe by a mere 20,000 votes, only for Mr Erdogan to pressure Turkey\u2019s election authority to overturn the results and order a rerun. Mr Imamoglu won again, by a bigger margin. Three years later a court banned him from politics and sentenced him to two years in prison (both penalties were stayed pending appeal), for calling the officials who stripped him of his initial victory \u201cidiots\u201d. That case goes on."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Imamoglu\u2019s re-election and the CHP\u2019s resurgence should reshape national politics. A victory for AK would have made it easier for Mr Erdogan to push ahead with introducing a new constitution, probably designed to give him at least another term. The scale of AK\u2019s losses in Istanbul and elsewhere means that his appetite for such changes, which would need to be put to a referendum, may be gone. \u201cThis is off the books now,\u201d says Berk Esen of Sabanci University. Mr Erdogan may have to speed up plans to find a successor as AK leader."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The marked improvement on the CHP\u2019s disappointing result (25.3%) in last year\u2019s general election had a lot to do with the economy, which remains in the doldrums. Even after interest-rate increases totalling more than 40 percentage points, annual inflation is still inching upwards. In March it topped 68%. Cheap credit and government largesse have run out. Mr Erdogan can no longer offer voters the kind of handouts that once shielded them, though only to an extent, from rocketing prices. \u201cPeople are feeling the economic pain even more than before,\u201d says Ms Balta. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "An overhaul of the CHP\u2019s leadership also helped. Last November the party deposed its longtime leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who had squandered a chance to beat Mr Erdogan in the presidential election, and replaced him with Ozgur Ozel, who is much closer to Mr Imamoglu. Another factor was a strong showing for New Welfare, a newly formed Islamist party that took votes from AK, having recently split from Mr Erdogan\u2019s governing coalition. It got 6% of the overall vote and won outright in two of Turkey\u2019s 81 provinces. So AK can no longer take hardline Islamist voters for granted. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Good party, an opposition party that once seemed on course to dominate Turkey\u2019s centre right, continued its slide. The party, which only two years ago polled in the high teens, received 3.8% of the overall vote. Its leader, Meral Aksener, whose leadership had already come under scrutiny after she flip-flopped on Good\u2019s alliance with the CHP last year, is under pressure to step down."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nowhere in the elections were the stakes as high as in Istanbul. Home to 16m people, it accounts for nearly 20% of Turkey\u2019s population and more than 30% of its economic output. Control over its $16bn budget and its patronage networks helps political parties finance themselves and their cronies. The city also makes and breaks careers. It was his win in the mayoral elections in 1994 that propelled Mr Erdogan onto the national stage and eventually to Turkey\u2019s highest office. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Imamoglu\u2019s chances of following the same route have now vastly improved. Already the opposition\u2019s most recognisable politician, the 52-year-old now has a clear path to a run in the presidential election in 2028. Meanwhile, Mr Erdogan is in a pickle. \u201cHe may even have to contemplate an early election or a transition back to a parliamentary system,\u201d says Mr Esen. The last thing he wants is for Mr Imamoglu to inherit the executive presidency Mr Erdogan designed for himself, which places almost no checks on his powers. \u201cFor him, that\u2019s a nightmare scenario.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 35}
