In the Philippines three of the four most recent presidents were the children of past ones. In Cambodia Hun Sen, the strongman who has ruled since 1985, recently passed on the prime ministership to his son, Hun Manet. North Korea has only ever known three generations of the same ruling family. Most families are bent on staying in power."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Political dynasties are not new. Nor can Asia claim a monopoly on them. They have shaped nearly every continent. Yet it is hard to think of an Asian country unsullied by them. Nowhere else is the case so assiduously cultivated by dynasts and their fans that power passed down by families is the best guarantor of social peace and spreading prosperity. This profoundly mistaken claim has egregious effects on the region\u2019s economies and their ability to grow."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Indeed, \u201cnepo babies\u201d are consolidating power. In January Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh\u2019s founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, secured her re-election as prime minister, in part by hounding the opposition\u2014her long-time enemy, Khaleda Zia, head of a rival clan, languishes under house arrest. (She insists the vote was free and fair.) In Pakistan in February the Sharifs and the Bhutto-Zardaris, two rival political dynasties who have historically alternated in power, in effect joined forces, with the powerful army\u2019s backing, to keep out a non-dynast, Imran Khan, in the election.

Prabowo Subianto, a general under the late Suharto\u2019s dictatorship and the former husband of Suharto\u2019s daughter, won the presidency. He chose the son of Jokowi, the popular outgoing president, as his running-mate. (In 2014 Jokowi insisted that becoming president \u201cdoes not mean channelling power to my own children\u201d.)

President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos is the son of a former president, also Ferdinand, who turned dictator before being deposed in a popular revolution in 1986. His vice-president, Sara Duterte, is the daughter of the previous president. The uneasy alliance that brought them to power in 2022 has since turned to open feuding."}, {"role": "body", "text": "History plays its part in making Asia prone to dynastic rule. In the Philippines many political families date back to colonialism. Upon independence rich families snapped up land that poor Filipinos could not afford. Clans, the Marcoses among them, developed vast haciendas. Four presidents since 2001 have come from these landowning classes. Ronald Mendoza of Ateneo de Manila University calculates that 78% of the country\u2019s governors, 73% of congressmen and 57% of mayors are from families boasting more than one member holding an elected position. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Land ownership also plays a part in the prominence of political families in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In India, by contrast, dynasties are products of post-independence democratic elites. This is especially the case with the Nehru-Gandhi family, which has produced three prime ministers, starting with the first, Jawaharlal Nehru. His great-grandson, Rahul Gandhi, runs Congress, the main opposition party (though he looks likely to be thrashed in India\u2019s upcoming election)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The effects of nepotism can be profound, as seen in crushingly poor North Korea. In the Philippines work by Mr Mendoza and others shows that in the country\u2019s more prosperous regions, such as Luzon in the north, political families encourage economic development, but also expand their wealth and clout. The limits of reform are reached when their interests and those of their cronies are at risk. Mr Mendoza\u2019s paper calls these dynastic politicians \u201cstationary bandits\u201d.
