Such Chinese voices have spent years urging foreign governments, especially those with deep ties to America, to fuss less about democratic values and other fuzzy notions, and to focus on cold, hard national interests. Now, they argue, the times are proving them right."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In China\u2019s telling, America stands exposed as a hypocrite, quick to accuse China or Russia of breaking international law and abusing human rights, while supplying bombs used to kill civilians in Gaza. In Beijing it is said that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine united the West, but Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas is dividing it again. It is predicted that if Donald Trump is re-elected his allies will learn, once again, that this is a friendless world and that \u201cAmerica First\u201d means what it says. In such a moment, wise foreign governments will stop pointing fingers at the flaws of other political systems or regimes, and concentrate on making their own citizens safe and prosperous. This advice is applied most particularly to relations with China. According to Chinese officials and scholars, shrewd foreign leaders should spurn American calls to join ideological blocs or defence alliances that are meant to contain China\u2019s rise. Instead, states should concentrate on striking bilateral, \u201cwin-win\u201d deals with Chinese economic partners."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A mood of grim vindication suffuses many gatherings of China\u2019s foreign-policy establishment. Today, the logic of power guides international relations, it is said. There is evidence that others share that outlook, to China\u2019s benefit. A newly published poll of South-East Asian political, business and academic bigwigs, conducted by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a think-tank in Singapore, makes gloomy reading for American diplomats. Since the poll was last taken a year ago, respondents from ASEAN countries are less confident that America is a reliable partner and more sceptical of the international rules-based order. The conflict in Gaza plays a role: it is the most-cited geopolitical concern, especially in such majority-Muslim countries as Indonesia or Malaysia. It comes ahead of \u201caggressive behaviour in the South China Sea\u201d (meaning, Chinese bullying of the Philippines and other neighbours). When asked to choose between America and China, should the region have to pick one of those rivals, 61% of respondents chose America in 2023. Now they are divided 50-50. This year\u2019s survey shows growing wariness of China\u2019s political and military clout. But its economic power is seen as unrivalled."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Beijing\u2019s tree-lined embassy districts, a mood of pragmatism prevails. Western governments challenge China\u2019s human-rights record at faraway UN meetings, raising concerns about repression in Xinjiang or Tibet, or the crushing of political rights in Hong Kong. But foreign envoys admit to an overwhelming focus on interests. The world is too messy for noisily confronting China over values. Then there is America\u2019s presidential contest, which a diplomat calls \u201cthe Armageddon election\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In short, China has what it all along said it wanted: a world guided by interests, not values and ideology. Alas, it is responding clumsily. In some cases, it is too cynical about the motives of others. China has a bad habit of telling countries that they are America\u2019s pawns. Chinese officials accuse the Dutch and Japanese governments of bowing to America when they control exports of semiconductors and other high-tech tools, urging them to think of their interests and shun America\u2019s \u201ccold war bloc mentality\u201d. In truth, such allies are following an overwhelming interest: maintaining relations with their strongest security partner. China is comfortable in a might-makes-right world. But fears of such a world are pushing Japan, South Korea, Australia and other neighbours to upgrade their armed forces and alliances.

Only last year France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, pleased China by saying that Europe should not be a \u201cfollower\u201d of America in the event of war over Taiwan. For all that, France and other European powers have serious disputes with China, based on calculations of their national interests. Some involve geopolitics. Mr S\u00e9journ\u00e9 called on China to pass \u201cclear messages\u201d to Russia that peace cannot be imposed on Ukraine, adding that \u201cthere will be no security for Europeans if there is no peace in accordance with international law.\u201d "}, {"role": "second", "text": "Trade disagreements "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The sharpest rows involve economics. With domestic demand weak and the property sector slumping, China is betting on an export-led manufacturing boom. As America walls itself off, Europe fears being the last large market open to a wave of Chinese goods. Mr S\u00e9journ\u00e9 told his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, that Europe\u2019s growing trade deficit with China is \u201cnot sustainable\u201d.

In Beijing this is called a bid to blackmail Chinese firms into opening EV factories in Europe, and perhaps it is. Often, though, Chinese arguments sound dismissive or tin-eared. The official Xinhua news agency attacked the notion that Chinese overcapacity threatens other countries, calling it \u201cbasic economics that surplus products naturally seek out markets elsewhere once domestic demand is met\u201d. That ignores some basic politics: China has chosen to seek growth overseas, rather than stimulate demand at home. It yearned for interests-dominated relations with the world. Now it has them.
