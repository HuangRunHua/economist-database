On his own terms, and few others, Mr Trudeau is succeeding. Both his Liberal Party and the tax\u2014which increased from C$65 to C$80 ($59) per tonne of CO2 equivalent on April 1st\u2014are unloved. Mr Trudeau survived a no-confidence vote ahead of the increase, but the debate it sparked has added to the burdens of a prime minister who is staggering through his ninth year in power.

Now that figure is 64%. Soaring interest rates and decades of sluggish housing construction are to blame. Mr Trudeau has promised a sop to renters in the forthcoming April 16th budget, a package of measures called a \u201crenters\u2019 bill of rights\u201d to be agreed with the provinces.

And besides, he says, the tax has been part of his platform for the past three elections, each of which he has won. \u201cWell, he shouldn\u2019t be afraid to have one more,\u201d Mr Poilievre shot back."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Eventually he will have to.
