Had it implemented them, 275m people in the Soviet Union would have been killed in the first hour of war. Another 325m would have died from radioactive fallout over the next six months.

Her book is at once methodical and vivid, technically grounded and at times lurid. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The American satellites which pick up the North Korean launch have sensors \u201cso powerful they can see a single lighted match from 200 miles away\u201d, she writes. Within 15 seconds radars can work out that the missile is heading for America. It will take just over half an hour to arrive. Once the president has been briefed, he has six minutes to make a choice."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Jacobsen coolly lays out the speed with which entire countries can be snuffed out. A Russian submarine off America\u2019s west coast could launch its full complement of missiles at all 50 states at once in 80 seconds. Even if an American submarine was close behind it could not fire a torpedo in that time, notes one expert. That fact is said to have shocked America\u2019s navy chief when it was revealed to him in 1981. Missiles launched from close to the American coastline would take a little over seven minutes to hit their target."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cNuclear War\u201d sits in the long tradition of didactic nuclear dystopia. The genre flourished in the 1980s with a series of films\u2014\u201cThe Day After\u201d, \u201cThreads\u201d and \u201cThe War Game\u201d (which had been made 20 years earlier, but was deemed too shocking to release then). All of these reflected contemporary fears that the cold-war arms race was spinning out of control. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The genre receded in the 1990s and 2000s: nuclear weapons were tools of the past. Yet Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2014a country which inherited nuclear missiles from the Soviet Union in 1991, but later gave them up\u2014has put them squarely back at the forefront of geopolitics and culture. Consider the success of Christopher Nolan\u2019s biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, and the commercial revival of \u201cAmerican Prometheus\u201d, the book on which that film was based."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There is a cinematic quality to Ms Jacobsen\u2019s scenario, too. In her account, the president is rushed onto a helicopter to escape to a mountain hideout. He is harangued by generals to retaliate quickly. \u201cIf somebody launches a nuclear weapon against us,\u201d says General John Hyten, a former commander of American nuclear forces, \u201cwe launch one back.\u201d William Perry, Bill Clinton\u2019s secretary of defence, tells Ms Jacobsen that once an incoming missile is detected \u201cwe prepare to launch\u2026we do not wait.\u201d The aim is to \u201cdecapitate\u201d North Korea\u2014destroy its leadership and command\u2014before it can fire more missiles."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Jacobsen conveys the reality of nuclear war in sometimes stomach-churning detail. In her imagined scenario, a North Korean missile obliterates a nuclear-power station north of Los Angeles, seeding spent fuel into the fallout. Victims of the X-ray flash are left \u201ca shredded horror of bloody tendons and exposed bone\u201d. Another bomb destroys Washington, DC. Firestorms bring hurricane-like winds of 660\u00b0C; people are baked alive in the bowels of the Capitol and White House. In documenting the minutiae of the apocalypse, the writing is redolent of \u201cHiroshima\u201d, a seminal article by John Hersey published in the New Yorker in 1946."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The story is about not just nuclear use, but nuclear war. Ms Jacobsen\u2019s narrative is built on an elaborate sequence of tragic misunderstandings. American missiles bound for North Korea must overfly Russia by dint of geography. American leaders cannot get Russia\u2019s president on the phone. Russia\u2019s sub-par early-warning satellites, which have indeed been known to confuse clouds for plumes, mistakenly see hundreds of missiles incoming. The Kremlin attacks America. America responds. There are 100 \u201caimpoints\u201d\u2014jargon for targets\u2014in the greater Moscow area alone."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is possible to quibble with details in Ms Jacobsen\u2019s scenario. It is hard to see why North Korea would risk a suicidal bolt from the blue. America might have a \u201claunch on warning\u201d policy, but as Dick Cheney, a former defence secretary and vice-president, has observed, \u201crealistically, most presidents wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d And would Russian leaders truly end the world because of data from faulty sensors?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "What is not in dispute, however, and what has receded from public understanding over the past 30 years, is the world-changing impact of nuclear weapons. The vast injection of soot into the atmosphere would result in a 70% reduction in the sun\u2019s rays for a decade. Rainfall would decline by 50%. \u201cAfter 10,000 years of planting and harvesting,\u201d writes Ms Jacobsen, \u201chumans return to a hunter-gatherer state.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And yet humans continue to deploy, maintain and build nuclear weapons. In \u201cCountdown\u201d Sarah Scoles, a science journalist, profiles the people who work in America\u2019s vast complex of nuclear laboratories, including Los Alamos in New Mexico (where Oppenheimer oversaw the invention and construction of the first nuclear bomb), the nearby Sandia labs, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The most compelling parts of her book are those in which she explores how these scientists, like Oppenheimer, reconcile their work with their principles."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some are gung-ho about the importance of nuclear deterrence, brandishing charts which show how deaths from major wars plummeted after the invention of the bomb. Others are equivocal, expressing opposition to nuclear weapons while insisting that someone has to ensure that the ones which exist remain safe and reliable. Still others seem deeply conflicted, preferring to emphasise the civilian applications of their research. \u201cI wonder if the activists on the outside understand that there are those of us on the inside that share many of their goals,\u201d says one scientist at Los Alamos, professing support for (eventual) disarmament. \u201cThat\u2019s not an extreme position here at all.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A generational divide also shines through \u201cCountdown\u201d. Before 1992 America kept its nuclear weapons in good order by explosive testing. \u201cPeople would just get on the airplane in the morning, go down [to Nevada] and blow shit up in the desert,\u201d says Rob Neely, head of simulations and computing at Livermore, with a hint of contempt. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until they shook the Earth that they really felt confident.\u201d As America designs a new warhead, the W93, for the first time in decades, some scientists of that era are sceptical that it can be done without testing. Mr Neely\u2019s generation relies on computer modelling, aided by the world\u2019s largest supercomputers and other technical wizardry. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a new generation of designers coming up,\u201d says Mr Neely. In a digital world, \u201cthe codes are their test site.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ms Scoles has written a balanced and readable book, one which conveys the attitudes of nuclear disarmers and deterrence advocates alike. What is striking is that even among those who believe that nuclear modernisation is essential in a world where China\u2019s arsenal is growing and Russia\u2019s is becoming more diverse, there is profound ambivalence about the consequences of this and the precariousness of deterrence. Nuclear weapons \u201cwill either have a pacifying effect or a catastrophic effect\u201d, acknowledges Brad Roberts, the author of \u201cThe Case for US Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century\u201d and once the Pentagon\u2019s top nuclear official. \u201cMonday, Wednesday, Friday, I feel one way. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, another,\u201d he tells Ms Scoles. \u201cThen Sunday I drink.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 62}
