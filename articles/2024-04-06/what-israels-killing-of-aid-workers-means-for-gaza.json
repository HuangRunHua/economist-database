On April 1st a group of aid workers left a warehouse in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza. The vehicles in their three-car convoy were clearly marked with the frying-pan logo of World Central Kitchen (WCK), a charity that has worked closely with Israel. Their route along the coastal road had been cleared with the Israeli army. But the precautions did not help: an Israeli drone loitering overhead fired three missiles at the cars, one after another, killing all seven people inside."}, {"role": "body", "text": "They are thought to be the first foreign aid-workers to die in the six-month Gaza war (around 200 of their Palestinian colleagues have been killed). Beyond the human tragedy, their deaths will have bigger consequences for Israel\u2019s diplomatic standing\u2014and for hungry Gazans."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most of the victims come from Western countries that support Israel. All are now furious. Britain summoned the Israeli ambassador for a rare d\u00e9marche, and Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, told Binyamin Netanyahu he was \u201cappalled\u201d. The United Arab Emirates, the main funder of WCK\u2019s work in Gaza, accused \u201cIsraeli occupation forces\u201d of \u201ctargeting\u201d the aid workers\u2014unusually strong language from Israel\u2019s closest Arab ally. Joe Biden, who calls Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the chef who founded wck, a friend, said he was outraged by the killings. \u201cIsrael has not done enough to protect aid workers,\u201d he said. The deaths will almost certainly lead to greater domestic pressure on such governments when it comes to arms sales to Israel. Whether they lead to a shift, in a way that 33,000 Palestinian deaths have not, is less clear."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Sorry not sorry"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Isaac Herzog, the Israeli president, called Mr Andr\u00e9s and expressed \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d. The army chief pledged a thorough investigation (though Israel has a poor track record of those). Israel\u2019s prime minister was less contrite: in a bizarre videotaped statement, a smiling Mr Netanyahu said that he was recovering well from hernia surgery and then acknowledged the \u201ctragic event\u201d in Gaza. \u201cThis happens in war,\u201d he said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The UN says that half of Gaza\u2019s 2.2m people face \u201ccatastrophic food insecurity\u201d and that hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza are on the brink of famine. Yet Israel has tried to sideline the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the main aid distributor in Gaza. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Instead, Israel has sought to work through NGOs. It was enthusiastic about WCK. Last month it allowed the group to start shipping aid to Gaza by sea, the first time in two decades it has loosened its maritime embargo of the territory. After the drone strike, though, WCK said it was pausing its operations in Gaza and turned back ships en route from Cyprus. Other NGOs followed suit. Aid workers are willing to accept risk: that is part of the job. But the risks seem too high in Gaza. Parts of the enclave have fallen into anarchy and Israeli commanders show scant regard for protecting civilians."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The effort to bring enough food into Gaza has been haphazard and deadly. Pallets air-dropped by Western and Arab forces have struck and killed civilians. Hungry Gazans have attacked lorries and been crushed in stampedes at food deliveries. America is trying to build a pier to receive bigger shipments of aid, but the project is still weeks away from completion and there are big questions around who will secure the pier and deliver the supplies."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For months Mr Netanyahu has refused to order the Israeli army to distribute aid in Gaza itself. But if Israel does not want UNRWA involved, and if other groups do not feel safe, it will have no choice. \u25a0"}], "id": 27}
