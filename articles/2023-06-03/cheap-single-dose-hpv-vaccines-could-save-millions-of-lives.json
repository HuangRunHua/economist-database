Most illnesses for which effective vaccines for children are widely available no longer threaten public health.

So common is hpv that nearly every sexually active person contracts a strain. Most never know, because the body flushes it out within two years. In some cases, however, the virus lingers, forming lesions on women\u2019s cervixes that can become cancerous."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This deadly condition is the second most common cancer among women aged 15-44. In rich countries, five-year survival rates are around 70%. In the poorest ones, which account for 90% of deaths from cervical cancer, less than one in five women with the disease are thought to survive."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The hpv jab, if given before people become sexually active, fully protects against hpv. But take-up has been slow. In the rich world, the share of people vaccinated by age 15 ranges from zero in Japan, which only resumed recommending the jab in 2022, to 81% in Britain. Many poorer countries have never begun vaccination drives. Worldwide, just 12% of eligible girls got the jab in 2021, down from 14% in 2019."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230603_WOF972.png", "imageWidth": 1280.0, "imageHeight": 1440.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "The nature of hpv can hinder vaccination efforts.

In December the World Health Organisation (who) said that a single dose of the hpv jab provided full protection. This will vastly expedite vaccination efforts.

The Serum Institute of India plans to make 200m doses in two years at prices well below the current market rate.

Based on a statistical model built by scholars at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, we estimate that among girls eligible for vaccination by 2030, this path would reduce the number who wind up dying of cervical cancer by 2.65m, when compared with the status quo. Maintaining the 90% rate beyond 2030 would prevent another 650,000 deaths among girls vaccinated in each subsequent year, before accounting for population growth. With cheap, single-dose vaccines on the horizon, such numbers may no longer be the stuff of fantasy.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chart sources: London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine; WHO; UNICEF; HPV Information Centre; The Economist"}], "id": 72}
