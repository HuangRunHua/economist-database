In reality, it is more of a caricature: dressing up, drinking and ogling old houses are widespread English pastimes, but black-tie opera and Pol Roger are minority pursuits. In 2023, however, Glyndebourne does indeed offer a state-of-the-nation tableau, just not in the way you might expect. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The weather was kind on the opening weekend, so patrons didn\u2019t need to summon the sangfroid to picnic in the rain, as occasionally they must. But a strike on the railways, a scourge of the times, complicated the trip. It nixed the train back to Victoria station, meaning Londoners had to petition for ticket refunds and drive. (A bank of electric-charging points has been installed in the car park, but it lacks another useful amenity: someone, perhaps a jobbing Old Etonian, to do up your bow tie.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The opera-house stage, meanwhile, is a battlefield in the culture wars as well as a set for melodramas. Opera\u2019s plots abound in toxic masculinity, abused heroines and ethnic stereotypes; left alone or revised, they are liable to upset somebody. Confessing that the \u201csocial assumptions\u201d in some past productions \u201cmay offend audiences today\u201d, Glyndebourne has vowed to do better. Settling into his seat, one regular dispensed with a printed synopsis as he already knew the story\u2014that is, he groaned, unless they had changed it. Donizetti got off lightly, but the festival\u2019s \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d has been accused of neutering the titular rake."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then there is the old-fashioned politics, and recent scarcity, of money. Producing high-end opera is horribly expensive\u2014and companies everywhere are feeling the pinch. Audiences are ageing. In America, philanthropy is erratic. In Britain, state funding has been slashed, leading Glyndebourne to cancel its usual autumn tour (it will instead put on some affordable shows at its home base). The glorious summer festival receives no subsidy, but tickets are pricey and go mostly to paid-up members. It will be sad if what, at its best, is the supreme art form is ever more a preserve of the rich. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Enjoying this European art in an English idyll, it is natural, too, to reflect on the underlying bonds. Glyndebourne\u2019s story marries English eccentricity with continental talent: founding it with his wife in 1934, John Christie, then the estate\u2019s master, drafted in starry refugees from Germany and Austria to give it some oomph. Gus Christie, his grandson and the current boss, has worried publicly about the impact of Brexit on the economy and the opera\u2019s finances."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As it happens, the plot of \u201cL\u2019elisir d\u2019amore\u201d features a huckster who peddles a bogus cure for all known ailments, intending, like a cynical politician, to be off the stage before he is rumbled. In his case the panacea is a potion that his marks are soon guzzling and slathering on themselves. One of them is Nemorino, sung here by Matteo Desole, a peasant in love with a landowner (he is bailed out by a rich uncle)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Desole nailed \u201cUna furtiva lagrima\u201d, the work\u2019s best-known number. Nardus Williams shone as his sassy beloved, Adina. Maxime Nourissat did a hilarious silent turn as the quack\u2019s sidekick. Especially in a scene of tipsy womenfolk, the choreography was droll. As usual, the acting was strong. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, as he often did, Sir Isaiah Berlin got it right about Glyndebourne. \u201cThat something so enchanting could happen in England at all,\u201d the Russian-British thinker wrote in 1984, was \u201ca source of lasting astonishment and delight.\u201d He loved it, in other words, not because it was typical, but because it was exceptional. The true quintessence of England in summer does not recline in Glyndebourne\u2019s gardens (\u201cPlease do not picnic on the croquet lawn\u201d); rather it basks on pebbly beaches and pub pavements where the English get sozzled and sunburnt on balmy afternoons.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:What happens when a story loses a main character?
