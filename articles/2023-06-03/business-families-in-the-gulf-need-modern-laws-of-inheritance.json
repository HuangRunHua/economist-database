Extended families can be enormous, since some rich Arabs still have a string of wives and many children. So family businesses may have a multiplicity of shareholders. Unless there is careful planning, the rules tend to make it hard to arrange for the most able or meritorious of the descendants to take over. The original owners can make bequests and transfers in their lifetime, but many do not. As there is no inheritance tax in any of the GCC countries, there is little incentive to make early handovers. Many owners are loth to step down early or even admit their mortality. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Courts in the Gulf have generally been ill-equipped to deal with such matters.
