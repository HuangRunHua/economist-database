It is youthful, cheap and increasingly trendy: artisan bakeries, craft boutiques and activist bookshops have sprung up between the pawnbrokers, bookmakers and off-licences.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If a referendum were held tomorrow, says Gordon McKee, the area would probably vote for independence again. (He was an activist for the union in 2014.) But as a referendum will not be held tomorrow, nor any time soon, there is a growing prospect it will elect Mr McKee as its Labour MP. For where Shawlands and the Labour Party are as one, he says, is in their appetite for ousting the Tory government in Westminster."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A change is sweeping through Scottish politics which is both unexpected and stunning. A combination of exhaustion and scandal is signalling the end of the SNP\u2019s electoral dominance and of the prospect\u2014at least in the medium term\u2014of the second referendum that the party craves. The toll of a decade of polarisation is becoming clearer, too. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Scotland is a small country of 5.5m people, and Ms Sturgeon bestrode it. The SNP has been in power in Holyrood continually since 2007; she served as deputy to Alex Salmond, and then as the country\u2019s first minister. The referendum of 2014 polarised the electorate into tribes of \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d voters. The Brexit referendum of 2016 gave Ms Sturgeon the pretext for a new rolling campaign for independence, which was bolstered by an increasingly erratic Conservative government in Westminster. Last year Ms Sturgeon announced that she had pencilled in October 19th 2023 as the date for a second referendum. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That turned out to be delusional. On February 15th Ms Sturgeon announced her resignation. She said she was tired, but her departure took on a new light when, two months later, police investigating the alleged misuse of party funds raided the home she shares with Peter Murrell, her husband and the SNP\u2019s former CEO. The police were reportedly searching for a woman\u2019s razor, jewellery and a wheelbarrow, among other things. A large motorhome was seized, and taken to a police lockup near Shawlands. A romantic movement that drew on a vaulting narrative of history suddenly looked humiliatingly small.

Its gains would include Glasgow South, the constituency which contains Shawlands. That would ease Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s task of forming a majority Labour government in Westminster.

It already faced two obstacles. One was constitutional: in November 2022 the British Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish Parliament could not legislate for a vote without Westminster\u2019s permission. The second was electoral: support for independence never achieved a sustained and clear majority of the sort which might have forced British prime ministers to accede to another referendum. Now a third has sprung up: the derailing of the SNP as the movement\u2019s political vehicle. The momentum stirred by Ms Sturgeon, a gifted orator, has dissipated. \u201cThe bubble has burst,\u201d says one nationalist. \u201cIndependence is inevitable,\u201d says another. \u201cBut it is not clear how we will get there.\u201d "}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230603_BRC382.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 662.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Constitutional polarisation will endure. More than four in ten Scots still support independence, even as the SNP tumbles in the polls (see chart 2). Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour\u2019s leader, is winning over nationalists, but he is not trying to turn them into unionists. His pitch is that a vote for Labour is now a faster \u201cescape route\u201d from the Conservative government and towards social change than a referendum. \u201cWe may disagree on the final destination for Scotland,\u201d he told The Economist in an interview. \u201cBut we can all agree we need to get rid of this rotten Tory government, so let\u2019s go on this part of the journey together.\u201d A second referendum could one day happen, says Mr Sarwar.

But that is a long shot. Even if the election turns out that way, the SNP\u2019s bargaining power is diminished by the fact that it cannot be seen to help the Tories stay in power. If it loses lots of seats itself, its mandate for a break-up will look weaker still."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cooler heads are preparing for a long game, in which the SNP focuses on extracting money and autonomy for Scotland from a Labour government which is keen to cement its electoral gains there. The confrontational approach taken by the SNP in the past decade was a departure from the party\u2019s long tradition of gradualism, notes Stephen Noon, a former party strategist. Its goal now should be \u201cmore independence\u201d, not independence full stop, he argues."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The party\u2019s monopoly over nationalist voters is meanwhile weakening: since January, the proportion of \u201cYes\u201d voters who say they will vote for the SNP in a Scottish Parliament election has fallen from 79% to 65%. Mr Salmond, now leading Alba, a pro-independence conservative splinter party, proposes that nationalists should run for election on a single ticket. He has an audience among the fundamentalist fringe, who will gather at Bannockburn, the site of an old victory over the English army, on the same day as the event in Dundee. The SNP will need to relax its \u201ccommand and control\u201d approach, says Gerry Hassan, a pro-independence academic. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Yousaf faces a battle to hold onto his job as first minister, say some colleagues. The police investigation may become more embarrassing. A probable by-election in Rutherglen, a seat outside Glasgow, may also undermine him. Mr Yousaf has decided to launch a legal challenge against the British government over a blocked gender-recognition law, an issue which splits his colleagues. The most likely trigger for a rebellion would be heavy losses in a general election, but if the polling fails to improve then his colleagues may move against him much faster, says one senior party figure."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All the while, difficult questions about the state of the country are becoming harder to dodge. Scotland\u2019s health service is struggling to recover from the pandemic; its school performance is slipping behind England\u2019s.

Over the longer term the per-person funding premium for Scotland awarded under the \u201cBarnett formula\u201d, a pan-UK regime of generous fiscal transfers, is set to shrink.

She took a leftward turn as she chased Labour\u2019s strongholds. She gave investors the cold shoulder, and used devolved powers to increase income taxes. Mr Yousaf hints he will raise them more. But these taxes fall on a small group of higher earners, particularly in the volatile oil and gas sector, and the extra revenue they bring in has been offset by a shrinking tax base as labour-force participation falls. During the leadership contest Kate Forbes, Mr Yousaf\u2019s principal opponent, warned that raising taxes further would risk driving activity south of the border; he dismissed her as a cheerleader for the rich. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Yousaf has upheld the coalition assembled by Ms Sturgeon in 2021 with the pro-independence Scottish Green party, which decries an \u201cobsession with growth\u201d. Such rhetoric plays well in places like Shawlands. But look at the potholed roads there, and the rubbish piled in the alleyways, and it is hard to conclude that this is a country suffering from a fixation with economic growth. Its problems stem from an obsession of a different kind. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
