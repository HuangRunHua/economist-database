Four miles off the north Devon coast in Bideford Bay, Algapelago, one of a spate of British seaweed startups, has just lost a sensor to the ocean. \u201cWell, that\u2019s quite irritating,\u201d says Olly Hicks wryly. \u201cThat was our first month of data.\u201d Mr Hicks, a co-founder of Algapelago, is captaining a small crew of research scientists and aquafarmers to a pilot site which could become Britain\u2019s largest. The square-kilometre site may one day yield as much as 2,000 tonnes of seaweed per year. Right now, it\u2019s much less."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Seaweed, the umbrella term for thousands of species of marine algae, is seen by some as a magic ingredient in the fight against climate change. Researchers are studying its potential to sequester carbon. From food products to cosmetics to plastic alternatives, it has a range of possible industrial applications. Algapelago\u2019s target market is agriculture; one recent study found that feeding cows seaweed reduced their methane emissions by over 80%. It is easy to grow: long pieces of rope are implanted with seaweed spores, incubated onshore and then taken out to sea."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Britain has a long way to go to get a foothold in a global seaweed industry worth $13.3bn. Worldwide algae production reached 36m tonnes in 2019, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, a UN body. Over 97% of that production happens in Asia, and nearly all of that is grown at scale. The British contribution, in contrast, comprises small-scale wild harvesting and is barely a rounding error."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With easy access to the nutrient-rich waters of the North Atlantic and the North Sea, Britain should have a natural advantage. More is steadily being done to make the most of it. In 2022 the Scottish Association for Marine Science set up the Seaweed Academy in Oban, offering training and education for would-be aquaculturists. \u201cWe were getting calls all the time from people saying \u2018Can we start a seaweed farm? Can we just buy some seeds from you?\u2019,\u201d says Rhianna Rees, the academy\u2019s co-ordinator. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But learning how to grow a crop is only one part of the equation. Making money out of seaweed is a very different proposition. \u201cI break absolutely everything down,\u201d stresses Ms Rees. \u201cI want people to know\u2026that it is a challenge.\u201d Cultivated seaweed is relatively expensive and finding customers for it can be tricky; Britain falls far short of producing the volumes big industrial players need. Without clear routes to market, investment, leases and licences are hard to get. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, an ecosystem of research institutions and a sea of minds focused on the climate emergency offer some hope for the industry. Off the coast of Devon, samples of Algapelago\u2019s first batch of seaweed look promising. Several metres underwater two ropes, each 200 metres long and laced with kelp spores, are coming into season. \u201cIn a perfect world you\u2019d have even crop all the way along that line\u201d, says Mr Hicks, drawing an imaginary path across the water. \u201cWe could have 250 lines on this patch.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
