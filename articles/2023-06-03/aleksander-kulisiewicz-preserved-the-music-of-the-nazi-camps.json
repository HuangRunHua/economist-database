Random acts of violence and murder were usual\u2014but the gathering was not. The prisoners had formed a secret choir to perform \u201cJ\u00fcdischer Todessang\u201d (\u201cJewish death song\u201d) by Rosebery d\u2019Arguto, once a famous composer and conductor in Berlin, now an inmate. They began with bass notes, writes Makana Eyre, each one an \u201comen of death, like the footsteps of the men on their way to their demise\u201d. It ended, unfinished, with the guards\u2019 onslaught."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Among those watching the performance admiringly was a Polish prisoner called Aleksander Kulisiewicz (pictured). A singer and writer, Kulisiewicz had been arrested by the Nazis after Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and was sent to Sachsenhausen in May 1940. There, music would help save his life, mentally transporting him out of the horror of the camp and giving him a reason to live. He had been a wilful and precocious teenager, running away from a middle-class Catholic upbringing to perform in nightclubs. He quickly became a key figure in the camp\u2019s rich and hidden cultural life."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Out of sight of the guards, or ignored by them, the inmates wrote, composed and performed, each act a powerful statement of resistance. Thanks to his extraordinary memory, Kulisiewicz could collect these assorted poems and compositions; he also performed himself and wrote song after song. \u201cNotturno 1941\u201d praises the Allied bombers flying overhead en route to Berlin. In another, he laments: \u201cBut on the barbed wire/A sad, charred body droops.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Eyre, an American journalist who lives in Paris, skilfully recounts the remarkable story of Kulisiewicz\u2019s survival and of the archive he went on to build. He is a deft storyteller, with a limpid style, moving his characters to centre stage, aside, then back again. He weaves a compelling, well-informed narrative and illuminates the inner dynamics of the camp\u2019s power structure.

German prisoners, many of them convicts and communists, were at the top, some exerting power as wardens. Below them were fellow \u201cAryans\u201d, such as Dutch and Norwegians, then eastern Europeans, and, at the bottom, Jews and Russian POWs. But the system was fluid, giving Kulisiewicz room to manoeuvre and stay alive through almost five years of incarceration. At Sachsenhausen, as at every camp, having something to barter was vital. When he needed a tiny sum to buy a stamp he asked a Czech priest for help. The priest agreed, in exchange for Kulisiewicz\u2019s margarine ration. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In April 1945, as the Soviet army approached, the SS guards evacuated over 30,000 prisoners from Sachsenhausen on foot. They were marched across Germany. When Danusia, a young woman prisoner known for her kindness, was unable to continue and stepped out of the column, Roland Tillard, a French prisoner who often accompanied Kulisiewicz on his accordion, moved to protect her. They were both shot and their bodies kicked into a ditch. Eventually the guards fled, frantically disposing of their uniforms.

He ran a high fever and seemed delirious, but a nurse realised he was reciting lyrics and poems.

From 1945 until he died in 1982, he gathered everything he could find about art, music, poetry and theatre in the camps. Kulisiewicz\u2019s archive was a collection of rare value, but it languished after his death. Polish and American institutions did not want it.
