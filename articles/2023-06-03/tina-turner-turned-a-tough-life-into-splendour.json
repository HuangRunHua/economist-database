She would do this until he fell asleep. How many times had she done this, tenderly and sisterly, though he reeked of the peach brandy he was hooked on, to wash down the drugs. She would also do his hair, trim his nails, feed him soup, whenever he asked\u2014even when, as now, her clothes were bloody from a beating, her face swollen and her eyes black. He always aimed his blows at her eyes. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Often she had picked up his gun and thought, I could shoot him sleeping. In all her 16 years with Ike Turner she never could, somehow. At 17 she had longed so crazily to be in his band, the hottest in St Louis, and through him she had learned that she had talent. He thought she sang like Little Richard, an astonishing big, raw, falsetto-whooping voice coming out of her skinny body. In the early days he bought her fur, long gloves, sparkly earrings, and drove her around in his pink Cadillac. The Ike and Tina Turner Revue packed in black audiences, then desegregated ones, and in 1971 their version of Creedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s \u201cProud Mary\u201d reached no. 4 in the Billboard Hot 100. So she carried on. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In her purse as she massaged him, that night in 1976, she had 36 cents and a Mobil credit card. He had taken all the rest. Even her new name, Tina Turner, was not fully hers; Ike had actually trademarked it, to show he owned her. She had been born Anna Mae Bullock in a cotton-picking family in Nutbush, a blink of a place, in Tennessee. The young woman who stayed with Ike, though she knew she ought to go, was Anna Mae, bushed, unsure and sometimes suicidal. The young woman who now rushed away from him, to find a room at the Ramada Inn and an airline ticket to California, was simply Tina, her free self, in control and just arriving. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "She was to become the musical sensation of the next two decades and longer. Her name moved 20m records, and sold more concert tickets worldwide than any other solo performer. She won 12 Grammys; two films were made of her life. No one could electrify a stage as she could, first in shimmying mini-dresses and then as a leather-clad diva belting out her songs, tossing her teased wigs and tiny skirts in a frenzy, kicking up her long, long legs. (How she had disliked those legs as she grew, impossible to buy clothes for!) She was sexual dynamite even at 60, when on her penultimate, sellout, world tour she danced on a narrow platform cantilevered out 60 feet above the crowd. She didn\u2019t intend to be sexy, she said, only practical: fishnets didn\u2019t run like other stockings, leather didn\u2019t show dirt or perspiration. Her only motive was to prove she was having fun. The moment music started up, any music, she had to dance. How did she do it in her favourite three-inch Manolo Blahniks and Louboutins? She stayed on her toes, kept those little steps moving. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The road was bumpy, though, after she left Ike. She was 37, old for the industry, and only half of a hit duo. Venues didn\u2019t know where to put either her or her songs, not \u201cblack\u201d enough to be R&amp;B and not \u201cwhite\u201d enough to be pop. (Phil Spector\u2019s Wall of Sound \u201cRiver Deep, Mountain High\u201d of 1966, which had made her and Ike huge names in Europe, failed in America for that reason.) So she went on, cleaning people\u2019s houses, doing her old numbers in cabaret, until in 1984 her fifth album, \u201cPrivate Dancer\u201d, suddenly broke through, and stardom fell glittering round her in middle age. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That album featured her biggest hit, \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to do With it?\u201d It was a cynical song she didn\u2019t like, and a strong-woman anthem like Gloria Gaynor\u2019s \u201cI Will Survive\u201d, but she didn\u2019t put herself in that category. She didn\u2019t necessarily want to be a strong person, or part of any women\u2019s movement. She was just Tina, who had come into this lifetime with a particular job to finish and intended to get it done. Ike\u2019s abuse was bad karma that trapped her in negative energy, but she overcame it. Instead of being angry she did her Buddhist chanting, Nam myoho rengekyo for ten or 15 minutes a day. She had no idea what the words meant\u2014being still half-Baptist\u2014but they touched something deep and moved her brain into the light, in the same way music did. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "She never became a black totem, either. The past was vivid enough, when she and all black performers at clubs in the South might be given filthy storage rooms or closets to change in, and often had to sleep in their cars. But white people in Texas had helped her when she escaped from Ike. And anyway, those days were past. She liked to look forward; to shine, no matter what."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Love was what she looked for. It hadn\u2019t come from her mother, who\u2014a psychic told her\u2014resented having her, in the womb or out of it. The woman who raised her, her father\u2019s mother, was strict and starchy; each time tomboy Anna came in from adventuring outdoors, with her hair pulled out and dirty as heck, she\u2019d get a spanking. And Ike was Ike. No love there, just a commercial deal, because she was his moneymaker. Their marriage was a quickie ceremony in Tijuana, and he took her to a whorehouse afterwards. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her audiences loved her, though, and she fed on that. She might not be a star, like Barbra Streisand or Maria Callas; she was just dancing and singing; but she could put on a great show. Her motivation was to make people happy. It was also, frankly, to earn the luxurious and more tranquil life she knew she deserved. She was seldom sure she could find it in America, where there was always a chance she might bump into Ike at some event or other. But from 1985 true love and luxury arrived at once when she met Erwin Bach, a German EMI executive 16 years her junior, moved with him to a chateau in Switzerland, and in 2013 married him in a gown of green taffeta, black silk tulle and Swarovski crystals. She was 73. As usual, she bloomed late. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The famous legs were starting to go a bit, showing cellulite and losing tone. She had various health scares. But her skin was still good. She could look in the mirror and think how pretty she was. In a past life, she knew she had been a queen in Egypt; in the chateau she had a painting of that. Now Ike\u2019s humble Cinderella relaxed on her Louis XIV sofas by the shores of Lake Zurich, still undisputed queen of the pop-rock stages of the world. \u25a0"}], "id": 74}
