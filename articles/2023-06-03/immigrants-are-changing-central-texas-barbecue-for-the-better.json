Restaurants are often plain, with bare wood tables and chairs, along with a few well-chosen pieces of Texas-themed decor. Meat is minimally seasoned, smoked over hardwood and served on butcher paper with almost nothing else: perhaps a few Saltines, pickles or onion slices, and tiny cups of sauce and beans."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Smoke\u2019N Ash in Arlington breaks almost all those rules. The decor is minimal, but the flag on the wall is red, yellow and green, rather than red, white and blue with a star. Fridges containing southern desserts such as peach cobbler stand next to shelves stacked with wicker serving trays and round-bellied clay pitchers. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Here perfectly cooked meat is maximally seasoned with a riot of warm spices; it is served with small piles of lentils, collard greens and rolled injera, a soft and sourish Ethiopian flatbread (see picture). At the plate\u2019s centre is a scoop of rice topped with pepper relish. The restaurant marries the backgrounds of the couple who run it: Patrick Hicks was born in Waco, about 100 miles south of Arlington; his wife Fasicka comes from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\u2019s capital. Their restaurant is just one example of how immigrants and first-generation Texans are changing barbecue for the better."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first question about the Hicks\u2019s project is why the marriage of those two cuisines, which at first seems improbable, works so well (setting aside the excellence in execution). One reason might be that they have complementary austerities. Ethiopian cuisine is brilliantly seasoned, but often meatless; Central Texas barbecue is meat-centric, but in classic form seasoned with nothing more than salt and pepper. Each fills gaps in the other."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The second question is how new a phenomenon it really represents. German and Czech immigrants helped define Central Texan barbecue more than a century ago. They opened butchers\u2019 shops, smoking their unsold meat to preserve it. Eventually their smoked meat became more popular than their fresh offerings. Mr and Mrs Hicks may have opened the world\u2019s first \u201cTex-Ethiopian smokehouse\u201d, as they call it, but they are heirs to a long and deeply American\u2014and Texan\u2014tradition."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nor are they alone. At Blood Bros. BBQ in Houston, Quy Hoang and brothers Terry and Robin Wong, who grew up together in a working-class suburb, serve Texas barbecue with East and South-East Asian influences. In Austin, Valentina\u2019s serves \u201cTex-Mex-BBQ\u201d; KG BBQ, started by an Egyptian who fell in love with barbecue on a visit to America, serves ribs with pomegranate and brisket shawarma. These restaurants are not gimmicks or high-minded fusion. They represent contemporary Texas and are tributes to barbecue\u2019s broad appeal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Inevitably these populations will help define American cuisine, as their predecessors did. Purists may quail, but as Daniel Vaughn\u2014who, as Texas Monthly\u2019s barbecue editor, surely has the world\u2019s best job\u2014explains: \u201cVariety is what\u2019s going to keep barbecue interesting and alive.\u201d \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 68}
