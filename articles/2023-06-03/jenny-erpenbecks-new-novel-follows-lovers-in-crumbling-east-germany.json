More simply, kairos can mean \u201cthe right time\u201d. It certainly seems that way for Hans, in his early 50s, and 19-year-old Katharina, who meet on a bus in East Berlin in July 1986. Their encounter is a coup de foudre of desire and anguish. The relationship plays out momentously\u2014and, over the course of the next four years, destructively\u2014as the German Democratic Republic begins to crumble. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cKairos\u201d is a continuation of Jenny Erpenbeck\u2019s series of novels about Germany over the past century. Taken together, the books constitute a supreme undertaking with parallels to Edgar Reitz\u2019s epic television series, \u201cHeimat\u201d. From her first book, \u201cVisitation\u201d (2010), in which a lakeside summer house is witness to decades of turbulence, to the fatalistic rootlessness of \u201cThe End of Days\u201d (2014) and \u201cGo, Went, Gone\u201d (2015), a 21st-century story of African migrants navigating the once-divided capital city, Ms Erpenbeck has proved time and again that she is a fearless, astute examiner of a country\u2019s soul.

Narrated alternately by Hans and Katharina in the close third person, and with a sublime translation by the great Michael Hofmann, \u201cKairos\u201d powerfully examines individual as well as collective history. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 66}
