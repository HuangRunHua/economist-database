But today\u2019s lawmakers have deemed that too lenient. A new law signed on May 26th by President Yoweri Museveni provides for the death penalty for some same-sex acts, including those that might spread HIV. Other clauses envisage long prison sentences for \u201cpromoting\u201d homosexuality or even for renting a room to a gay couple. \u201cWe have a culture to protect,\u201d said Anita Among, parliament\u2019s speaker. \u201cThe Western world will not come to rule Uganda.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "It is not just Ugandan homophobes who cloak themselves in anti-colonial garb. In Ghana, the preface to a similar bill warns of \u201cthe infiltration of foreign cultures\u201d.

But the West\u2019s conservative culture warriors are also pushing their ideas in Africa, feeding a moral panic in societies where homophobia is already routine.

Consider a conference on \u201cfamily values and sovereignty\u201d organised by the Ugandan parliament in March. It brought together religious leaders, youth activists and MPs from 20 African countries. Others attending included delegates from Family Watch International (FWI), an American group that helped develop the programme, and Christian Council International, from the Netherlands. Afterwards they met Mr Museveni and his wife Janet, the education minister, who is a born-again Christian.

For two decades she has been building networks in Africa to oppose \u201ccomprehensive sexuality education\u201d, which she says sexualises children without parental consent. In a written statement FWI said it has never supported anti-homosexuality bills in Africa and opposes several sections of Uganda\u2019s new law.

One of them was George Peter Kaluma, an MP from Kenya, where he has submitted a bill modelled on the Ugandan one. Another was Sam George, the man behind Ghana\u2019s proposed law.

For African conservatives, Western culture wars offer inspiration. \u201cThe language has been globalised,\u201d says Kapya John Kaoma, a Zambian priest at Boston University who has studied anti-LGBT politics. Gillian Kane of Ipas, an American group that campaigns for safe abortion and contraception, argues that aspects of FWI advocacy are \u201cfear-based\u201d and widen the space for such politics, though African politicians bear most responsibility for the laws.

For many years its representative in Russia was Alexey Komov, a right-wing activist close to figures allied to the Orthodox church.

Sylvia Tamale, a Ugandan academic, has argued that African societies once had a nuanced understanding of sexuality, before colonial missionaries imposed rigid moral codes.
