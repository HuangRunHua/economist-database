The live audio event, hosted by the social network\u2019s owner, Elon Musk, descended into farce as Twitter\u2019s servers struggled to cope with the few hundred thousand listeners who had tuned in. When he could be heard, Mr DeSantis said he had decided to announce on the platform because, unlike the \u201clegacy media\u201d, Twitter is a \u201cbeacon of free speech\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The debate about who can say what online is again heating up globally. Twitter, the favoured network of politicians and the press, is under the mercurial new management of Mr Musk, a self-declared free-speech absolutist who has restored the accounts of previously banned users such as Mr Trump. Meta, a larger rival, is reportedly preparing a text-based network of its own, to be launched this summer. Social-media platforms face a test over the next 18 months as America\u2019s presidential election approaches, one of the world\u2019s great festivals of online bile and misinformation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Into this fray step politicians and judges with regulatory proposals. With Congress deadlocked, America\u2019s state legislatures and its courts are drawing new lines around the limits of speech. In Europe legislatures have gone further. These moves are inspiring governments in less democratic parts of the world to write new rules of their own. What can be said and heard online is under scrutiny."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Policing the online public square is a daunting task. Things have calmed down a bit since Mr Trump left office and covid-19\u2014and the associated wave of disinformation\u2014died down, but in 2022 the world\u2019s three largest social-media platforms\u2014Facebook and Instagram, owned by Meta, and YouTube, owned by Google\u2014removed or blocked 11.4bn posts, videos and user comments.

But many moderation decisions are hard (see chart). In the latest quarter, Facebook removed or blocked 10.7m posts that it deemed hate speech and 6.9m that it considered bullying, both concepts where there is room for disagreement. To take one recent dilemma, Meta recently ordered a review of whether it has been overzealous in its policing of the Arabic word shaheed, which is generally translated as \u201cmartyr\u201d but whose meaning can change in different contexts. The platforms have mostly been left to resolve such quandaries by themselves. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now, however, politicians are stepping in. In America Democrats and Republicans agree that social networks are doing a lousy job of moderation, and that it is time to change Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability for content posted by users (with exceptions such as content linked to sex trafficking). But they disagree completely on what to do about it. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Democrats, who accuse tech billionaires of stoking rage and misinformation for clicks, want platforms to remove more content. Republicans, who think woke California busybodies are gagging conservatives, want them to remove less.

The result is congressional deadlock."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Supreme Court has had the chance to tinker with Section 230. But on May 18th, in rulings on two similar cases involving YouTube and Twitter, which had hosted content uploaded by terrorists, it declined to alter the status quo, rejecting the idea that online platforms have liability for crimes their users commit. NetChoice, a tech lobby group, described the decision as a \u201chuge win for free speech on the internet\u201d. Section 230 looks safe for now."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With no luck at the federal level, reformers on left and right are focusing on the states. Last year California passed a law forcing tech companies to collect less user information on children, among other things.

Passed in July 2022, the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) will kick in next year. Britain\u2019s Online Safety Bill, four years in the making, is expected to be enacted later this year. Both take a different approach from America\u2019s. Rather than altering who has liability for online content (the issue at the heart of the Section 230 debate), they force platforms to do a kind of due diligence, to keep bad content to a minimum."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Europe\u2019s DSA requires online platforms to set up complaint-handling processes and demands that they tell users how their algorithms work, allowing them to change the recommendations they receive. Smaller platforms, defined as those with fewer than 45m users in the eu, will be let off some of these obligations to stop them from drowning in red tape (some larger rivals warn that this could make them a haven for harmful material). For those big enough to qualify for full oversight, the DSA represents \u201ca significant financial burden\u201d, says Florian Reiling of Clifford Chance, a law firm.

On May 26th Thierry Breton, a European commissioner, tweeted that Twitter had left the EU\u2019s voluntary code of practice against disinformation, adding what sounded like a threat: \u201cYou can run but you can\u2019t hide.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Britain\u2019s parallel legislative effort is shaping up to be more far-reaching.

An American tech firm dubs it \u201cone of the most complex bills we face anywhere in the world\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It goes further than the EU in its loosely worded requirement for platforms to proactively screen material. The larger social networks already check videos for matches with known child-abuse content. But subtler crimes, such as incitement to violence, are harder to detect automatically. The scale of some platforms\u2014YouTube uploads 500 hours of video per minute\u2014means that a strict requirement to pre-screen content could throttle the amount of new material uploaded.

The bill therefore imposes a duty to ensure that moderation \u201c[applies] in the same way to a wide diversity of political opinion\u201d. Similarly, the EU has promised that it will provide \u201cprotection for media against unjustified online content removal\u201d as part of its forthcoming European Media Freedom Act, a response to crackdowns on the press in members states such as Hungary and Poland."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The most controversial part of Britain\u2019s bill, which required platforms to identify content that is \u201clegal but harmful\u201d (eg, material that encourages eating disorders), has been dropped where adults are concerned.

Some may even quit. WhatsApp, a Meta-owned messaging app, says it is unwilling to break its end-to-end encryption to meet a requirement in Britain\u2019s bill that companies must scan private messages for child abuse. It may not come to that: the bill would let Ofcom demand the data only in cases where it determined that such a measure was proportionate. Still, threats to up sticks are becoming more common.
