The disproportionate initial impact of the pandemic on the developed world was strikingly more than just the underfunding of public health. This ignores the significance of mobile populations and other factors related to the way the disease spread so quickly.

It is not to be understood as simply another version of contemporary Irish, Scottish or Welsh nationalisms. Rather, alongside a sense of injustice around the alleged unfair treatment of England within the domestic union, English nationalism manifests as a very strong commitment to a particular understanding of Britain\u2019s past and vision of its potential future."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bagehot seems to see no merit in attempts to understand why the results of the Brexit referendum were territorially differentiated. Given the amount of resources that politicians have devoted to addressing the alleged drivers of referendum voting (\u201cleft behind\u201d\u2019 and the rest) this seems a curious position. But at any rate, as academics we make no apology for seeking to do so, and the fact of the matter is that, in England, those who cleave to an English identity voted overwhelmingly to Leave while those who feel solely or predominately British tended to vote Remain. It is not the increase in English identity, but its salience to contemporary politics that warrants careful investigation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Finally, Bagehot claims that the Conservative Party\u2019s attempt to mobilise English identity in the 2015 general election made no difference to the overall result.
