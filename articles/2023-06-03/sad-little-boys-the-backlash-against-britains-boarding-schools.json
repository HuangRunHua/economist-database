For several centuries and for fat fees they provided the English upper classes with a ripping blend of architectural beauty and physical discomfort; with neoclassical corridors and cold showers; with lashings of Latin and just plain lashings. The pupils they produced were an equally idiosyncratic mix of the sophisticated and the childlike, mingling precocious brilliance with speech that never quite left the classroom. It was a heady brew and Britain was intoxicated by it: of the 57 British prime ministers, 20 went to Eton. As Boris Johnson, one of their number, might say: \u201cCrikey!\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Boarding schools are not yet in trouble. Their pupil numbers are relatively constant\u2014around 70,000, owing partly to masses of boarders from abroad. But their charms may be becoming easier to resist. Elite private schools are a less secure route into the top universities than they were. In 2014, 99 pupils from Eton were accepted into Oxbridge; in the 2021-22 school year, it managed 47. (Brampton Manor Academy, a state school in London, had 54.) "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That raises hard questions about value for money. Annual fees for Eton were a mere \u00a3861 (around \u00a310,000 today) a year in Mr Johnson\u2019s era. Today, its fees are \u00a315,432 \u201ceach half\u201d (which, as Eton\u2019s website explains, means thrice yearly; \u00a346,296 a year apparently does not stretch to an understanding of fractions). For this, Etonians enjoy one pool; two chapels; three \u201ctheatre spaces\u201d; a composer-in-residence; a filmmaker-in-residence; a pet pianist; and a director of \u201cinclusive education\u201d, who notes that to promote diversity at Eton it is important \u201cto enable people to talk about uncomfortable things\u201d. Like, say, those fees. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Perhaps the most profound threat to boarding schools is more fundamental. And that is the idea that to send a child as young as seven or eight away from home is not privilege but brutality; that even if this education goes well\u2014no abuse; First XI cricket; scones for tea; huzzahs all round\u2014it will still have been very wrong. Older adolescents might well find the experience less cruel, perhaps even a relief. But as John Bowlby, a psychologist who was the father of attachment theory, put it: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t send a dog away to boarding school at age seven.\u201d Richard Beard, a writer who lacerates private schools in his book, \u201cSad Little Men\u201d, echoes the theme. The architectural beauty and bells and whistles of boarding schools, he says, are like the label on a dog-food tin which \u201cisn\u2019t for the dog; it\u2019s for the person buying it\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Send your offspring to boarding school, agrees Alex Renton, an author and campaigner who was abused at his prep school, and \u201cyou\u2019re putting your child into care. You\u2019re just paying for it.\u201d Psychologists increasingly argue that posh care leads to bad outcomes. In 2011 the term \u201cboarding-school syndrome\u201d was coined by Joy Schaverien, a psychotherapist, to cover a series of symptoms such as depression and emotional repression. A group called \u201cBoarding School Survivors\u201d provides therapeutic help to former boarders. Since its foundation in 1990 it has treated hundreds.

To extrapolate from the experiences of children 40 years ago is \u201cobtuse\u201d, says Gavin Horgan, headmaster of Millfield School and chair of the Boarding School Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different environment.\u201d Whereas once pupils were sent away for months, many young boarders are now weekly; they can video-call home each day. Attitudes are different, too: today boarding-school teachers talk not about stiff upper lips but safeguarding and mental-health first-aiders. Moreover, boarding-school syndrome is posited rather than proved by hard data. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But critics say that this is partly because no one has bothered to gather the information. Snobbery and a national obsession with old stone mean that it is still a struggle to see people in Palladian mansions as deprived.

Victorian Britons, believing that the battle of Waterloo had been won on the playing-fields of Eton, set about creating new fields and new Etons in order to mass-produce the upper-middle classes. Children, removed from the \u201csoftening\u201d influence of mothers, were put in uniform clothes, in uniform beds, in uniform dorms, where they spoke uniform vocabulary (\u201cTopping! Pax! Sneak!\u201d) with an increasingly uniform accent: the clipped tones of Received Pronunciation (RP) are thought to have emerged as part of this school-led standardisation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The empire might have been happy with the results, its children less so. Churchill wrote of a \u201clife of anxiety\u201d at his prep school; C.S. Lewis called his first school \u201cBelsen\u201d. One of the best arguments in favour of boarding schools is the quality of the prose attacking them; one of the best arguments against is its content. After that beating, Orwell felt that \u201clife was more terrible, and I was more wicked, than I had imagined.\u201d Such, such were the joys. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
