It is in the north-western state of Sinaloa, a hub of Mexican drug gangs, which started off growing marijuana before turning to cocaine trafficking and, more recently, fentanyl. Humaya Gardens hosts a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of dead narcos. Many were members of the Sinaloa cartel, formerly run by Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who inspired a television series and now festers in an American prison."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The cemetery itself looks like a swanky nouveau-riche development. (Some refer to this flashy style of architecture as \u201cnarcdeco\u201d.) The multi-storey, multi-plot mausoleums are larger than most Mexican homes. Many are gaudy. There is a mini Taj Mahal and an imitation Greek temple. Some have cupolas; others boast angels or statues of saints. There is a lot of marble and some stained glass. At least one has bulletproof-glass windows. Rumour has it that some of the mausoleums cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to build.

Some have bedrooms or benches outside to bask in the sun. The main chamber features a photo of the dead\u2014almost always a young man. Many pose with guns; one has a display of knives in the tomb.

Their lives are often short: most photos show men in their 20s or 30s. But like others in Mexico, narcos are often religious and want a proper burial. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The first construction in Humaya Gardens began in 1969. (Ordinary people are buried there, too, in much more modest one-plot graves.) But it was in the 1990s that many of the grandest tombs started to be erected. This coincided with a crackdown on gangs, known as the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, which left more people dead, as well as the development of a more flashy and excessive narcocultura (the lifestyle of drug traffickers).

In Chile the government has recently demolished several narco burial sites.

Unlike gangs elsewhere in Mexico, the Sinaloa cartel has convinced locals that it does not prey on them. \u201cHere they are part of the social fabric,\u201d says Mr Ayala. \u201cThere is no clear line between them and us.\u201d Until death, that is, when some get tombs fit for kings and others simple graves.
