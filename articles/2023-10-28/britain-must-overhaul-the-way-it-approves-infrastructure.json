In the coming decades electricity will not only keep the lights on; it will also be needed for people to drive to work and stay warm. That means the grid must double in capacity, as well as morphing in shape, to draw power from hundreds of wind and solar farms. In the next seven years Britain will need to build four times more grid infrastructure than it has managed in the past 30. The line through Essex is one of 17 marked for urgent completion (see map)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Already, bottlenecks are building up. Wind and solar farms are told to wait more than a decade to feed their power into the grid; around \u00a3200bn ($243bn) of such projects sit in the queue.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The government is supposed to set out its approach to infrastructure in a set of national policy statements. The energy one has not been updated since 2011. That gives developers, including National Grid, little sense of how to approach trade-offs\u2014such as how wiggly a route should get to avoid houses or woodlands\u2014and opens the door to judicial reviews. A tangle of agencies have responsibilities; none has a convincing plan for where power lines and substations should go as part of a coherent system, according to a review by Nick Winser, Britain\u2019s electricity-networks commissioner. Ofgem, the regulator, and the arms of National Grid contradict one another. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "All of which is ammunition for determined activists like Ms Pearson. Some 14 East Anglia MPs (including two in the cabinet) back her campaign, which also counts on the help of a small army of (semi-)retired lawyers, engineers and accountants. Such outfits can hardly be blamed for poking holes in plans. Yet the result is that much-needed projects are held to ransom, says Jeegar Kakkad of the Tony Blair Institute, a think-tank. Groups of volunteers hold up tens of billions in investment. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the case of power lines, one alternative is putting the cables underground. That already happens in designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. But it is five to ten times more expensive, not a cost most want to see appear on their electricity bills. Putting them in the sea, as Ms Pearson suggests, has a high price tag, too.

Labour promises to streamline infrastructure consultations by offering communities off-the-peg options. Advisers hope a clearer national policy would reduce the scope for judicial reviews; there is talk of a quick-fire planning bill. In effect, Labour wants to stop local groups from vetoing national projects.

But payments can backfire if they are seen as bribes. Essex villagers reacted badly to the idea that their principled opposition to pylons could be bought off with a measly heat pump. Better to make it much harder to block projects and then use compensation to soften the blow for affected locals. Currently, only the farmer whose field a pylon squats in gets paid. Mr Winser proposes a lump sum for everyone close to new lines. Ireland already has such a system of standardised proximity payments. If Labour wants to \u201cget Britain building\u201d and remain in power, that model could spread. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
