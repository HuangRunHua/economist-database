What began as a sleepy autumn weekend ended with Israel making ready to invade Gaza."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nearly three weeks after the October 7th massacre in Israel, however, that offensive has yet to begin. Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza continues, killing thousands and destroying around 9% of buildings in the territory. A near-total siege has left civilians short of food and water and hospitals unable to function. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Apart from a few small raids, though, the ground troops have yet to move. Some of the 360,000 reservists called up in Israel\u2019s largest-ever mobilisation have been sent home.

On October 25th he confirmed that a ground offensive is still planned. But it will be smaller and slower than anyone would have expected in the days after the massacre, in which Hamas militants murdered more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians."}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to the latest count from Israeli officials, the tally of at least 220 people seized during the attack includes scores of children and old people, and citizens of at least a dozen foreign countries. The hostages have become a source of pressure on Mr Netanyahu\u2019s government. The captives\u2019 families have waged an effective public-relations campaign, and foreign leaders have pushed him to try to free their citizens."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Vigils have been held across Israel. The hostages\u2019 relatives often give television and radio interviews. The issue is deeply political. Many of those from the kibbutzim that were attacked are the secular, left-leaning sorts of Israelis most likely to have joined protests against Mr Netanyahu\u2019s government throughout the year. They feel his government forsook them on October 7th and is still failing them. Pressure from the families has already forced the government to change its plans. Originally inclined to rush into Gaza without regard for the hostages\u2019 safety, it has since declared that their rescue is a \u201ctop priority\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Qatar, host to some leaders of Hamas, is also feeling the heat.

Israeli officials had been scathing about Qatar in recent weeks.

Some was taken from the attackers\u2019 body cameras, the rest from surveillance cameras and mobile phones.

On Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon, there have been daily exchanges of fire. Hizbullah, the Shia militia cum political party, has attacked Israeli towns and army posts with anti-tank missiles, and Israel has shelled and bombed southern Lebanon. Hizbullah admits that some 40 of its fighters have been killed (the real toll is probably higher). It is the most sustained fighting since the war they fought in 2006, though it has yet to escalate beyond tit-for-tat bombardment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Militias in Syria and Iraq have used drones to attack American bases, where two dozen soldiers were lightly injured.

But they are risky. A strike that kills a lot of people in either Israel or Lebanon would be enough to upset the balance. To make that less likely, Israel has evacuated around two dozen communities in the north, including Kiryat Shmona, a city of more than 20,000 people near the Lebanese border. Villages on the Lebanese side have also emptied as residents flee farther north."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Israel has hardened its border too: many reservists called up this month were sent north, not south. America has deployed two aircraft-carrier strike groups, one to the eastern Mediterranean, the other to the Persian Gulf. On October 21st it said it would deploy more Patriot air-defence battalions and a THAAD anti-ballistic missile battery. Another 2,000 troops are on standby for a possible deployment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Israel\u2019s assessment is that these reinforcements have deterred Hizbullah from ramping up the fighting. Talk in the war cabinet of launching a pre-emptive strike on the group has died down. Of late, oil markets seem more sanguine, too. The price of Brent crude, which spiked from $85 a barrel before the Hamas attack to $92 on October 19th, has slipped to below $90."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Every Israeli war is fought watching the clock, as international condemnation grows and eventually America qualifies its support. In 1973 America urged a ceasefire ending the Yom Kippur War, even though Israeli forces were on the advance. In 2006 it imposed a ceasefire before Israel could achieve its objectives in Lebanon. As one Israeli official puts it, \u201cOur window of international legitimacy is limited.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The scenes of horror in Gaza mean the window is already closing. The UN says 1.4m people in the territory have been displaced; its shelters are crammed to two-and-a-half times their capacity. On October 13th Israel told the entire population of northern Gaza to flee south. Thousands who heeded that order have since travelled back the other way. If nowhere feels safe, they reckon, better to be in one\u2019s own home than a tent or a crowded shelter."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Israel refuses to allow any supplies to cross its border until Hamas releases all the hostages it holds captive. On October 21st the first shipment of aid, a convoy of 20 lorries containing food, water and medicine entered Gaza from Egypt. Several more deliveries followed. This is only a small fraction of what the territory needs (the UN says at least 100 lorries a day are required). Families have cut back to one meal a day. People have resorted to drinking salty water from wells. Aid workers say poor sanitation has led to cases of scabies and diarrhoea and fear that even more serious diseases will spread."}, {"role": "body", "text": "No fuel has entered Gaza since October 7th. The sole power plant is offline and Israel has cut the supply of electricity that it normally provides. The World Health Organisation says six of Gaza\u2019s 13 hospitals have run out of fuel.

Israel refuses to allow fuel shipments."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Arab states want an immediate ceasefire. The European Union is split, but Josep Borrell, its top diplomat, has called for a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d to allow more supplies to enter.

America still offers Israel staunch backing, but will not do so indefinitely."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Mr Netanyahu faces mounting pressure from his hard-right base to prove he is clobbering Hamas, and is loth to admit that Mr Biden or the hostages\u2019 families have stayed his hand. Instead, using proxies, he has begun to brief that the army is not ready for a ground campaign. Rather than risk soldiers\u2019 lives, it is argued, Israel should launch more devastating air strikes, including the use of bunker-busting bombs, to destroy Hamas\u2019s tunnel network."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The army has pushed back, saying it is \u201cfully ready\u201d for an invasion. There have been days of ugly but accurate headlines in the Israeli media about discord between Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Mr Netanyahu tried to fire Mr Gallant in March, after the latter voiced criticism of the government\u2019s plan to weaken the supreme court. He was forced to retreat after massive public protests.
