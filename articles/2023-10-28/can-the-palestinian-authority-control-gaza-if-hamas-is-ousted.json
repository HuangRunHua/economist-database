Many, especially Israel\u2019s allies, are looking to the Palestinian Authority (pa), which was thrown out of Gaza by Hamas almost two years after Israel withdrew its troops and dismantled its settlements there in 2005. But the pa seems to be in no position to take charge of the coastal enclave. In fact there are no guarantees that by the end of this war it will even be in control of Ramallah, the de facto capital city of the West Bank."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Born out of the Oslo Accords of 1993, the pa was supposed to be the basis of a future Palestinian state. But as the prospects of that state\u2019s establishment have receded, so has confidence in the pa, which is led by the 87-year-old Mahmoud Abbas (pictured) and is widely seen by Palestinians as corrupt and incompetent. Mr Abbas was elected to serve a four-year presidential term in 2005\u2014and has been there ever since. \u201cThere is not really a whole lot left in the legitimacy tank of the pa,\u201d says Salam Fayad, a former prime minister of the pa. \u201cUnless they really change course very rapidly, the whole thing could fall.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Partly because it has been unable to protect Palestinian civilians on the West Bank from  attacks by Israeli settlers or halt the expansion of Israeli settlements, the pa has lost control of security in swathes of the West Bank to militant groups such as Kata\u2019ib Jenin and the Lions\u2019 Den in Nablus in recent years. The slaughter of 1,400 Israelis by Hamas on October 7th, Israel\u2019s subsequent bombardment of Hamas in Gaza, and a sharp increase in attacks by settlers have all pushed it into an even more precarious position."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231028_EPM937.png", "imageWidth": 600, "imageHeight": 879}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a poll in September, 53% of Palestinians said they thought an \u201carmed struggle\u201d against Israel was the best way to establish a state, compared with just 20% favouring negotiations. As the war in Gaza goes on, along with the flow of pictures coming out of the enclave that show civilians killed by Israel\u2019s bombing, Hamas\u2019s popularity appears to be increasing, while the pa\u2019s seems to be plummeting. When news broke of an explosion at Gaza\u2019s Ahli Arab hospital, furious crowds thronged into the streets of the West Bank. Their anger was not, however, directed at Israel, which most Palestinians believe bombed the hospital. (A more likely explanation for the blast, according to independent analysts and Western intelligence agencies, is that it was caused by a misfired rocket launched from Gaza by Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group.) Instead anger was directed at the pa. Hundreds marched on Mr Abbas\u2019s presidential compound in Ramallah. In an echo of the protests that rocked Arab countries and toppled governments in 2011, many chanted: \u201cThe people want the fall of the president.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fatah, the Palestinian faction led by Mr Abbas that dominates the pa, was already riven by infighting over who would succeed him. Now it is being further torn apart over its stance on Hamas. Those close to the leader believe Fatah\u2014and the pa, with which it has become synonymous\u2014can muddle through to see the crushing of its Islamist rival, which could perhaps give it a chance to take back control of Gaza. However, many among the party\u2019s rank and file think differently. \u201cA collapse [of Hamas] in Gaza will lead to a collapse in Fatah,\u201d says a Fatah official in Ramallah, as he agonised over the safety of his relatives in Gaza."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even those who have little love for Hamas and its Islamist fervour are dismayed by the prospect of its being wiped out by Israel. They are urging Mr Abbas to set aside factionalism and to rally the secular Fatah movement behind Hamas in a unity government. \u201cBoth sides need each other,\u201d says Raed al-Debiy, a Fatah official in Nablus, the West Bank\u2019s biggest city. \u201cHamas needs the international legitimacy of Fatah, and Fatah and the pa need the popularity of Hamas.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The pa\u2019s legitimacy crisis is being intensified by a financial one. Although the pa has not been able to evolve into an independent Palestinian state, many Palestinians accept it simply as a source of salaries and public-sector work. Yet it seems it may not be able to provide even these. In the next few weeks the pa is scheduled to pay public-sector salaries, including the wages of 34,000 members of the Palestinian Security Forces. But it can afford to pay less than 50% of this month\u2019s wage bill, according to one senior pa official, who added that, even before the current war in Gaza, Israel was withholding customs revenues which it is obliged to hand over. This cash crunch is likely to become more acute as a result of the war because Israel has closed its borders to the thousands of West Bank Palestinians who usually work in Israel and pay income taxes to the pa."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Members of pa\u2019s security forces are already accused by friends and family of being proxies  for Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank. In many cases, the only thing that keeps them from leaving their posts is their monthly pay-cheque. The pa has weathered previous financial storms and paid salaries late, or been unable to pay them in full, in the past. But the latest projected pay cut is far larger. If it goes ahead, tens of thousands of young men in the pa\u2019s police and national security forces may not show up to work. Some would be ripe recruits for other armed groups in the West Bank including Hamas and Islamist Jihad, the group that may have been responsible for the hospital blast in Gaza. In any case, it is hard to see how unpopular and unpaid security forces will stand their ground if Palestinians try to sack the presidential palace. \u201cThe Palestinian public is reaching a boiling point and an explosion against the authority,\u201d says Amjad Bashqar, a Hamas official in Nablus. \u201cThe only thing delaying it is our focus on the resistance [against Israel]\u201d.
