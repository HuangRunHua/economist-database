The three-time former prime minister had once again been ousted from power, jailed on corruption charges, disqualified for life from holding public office and then exiled to his plush London flat. Not even his brother Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s year-long spell as prime minister, which ended in August, could facilitate his return to Pakistan. The country\u2019s powerful generals, who had at various times elevated Mr Sharif and then laid him low, would not allow it. But at last they have relented. On October 21st Mr Sharif returned to Pakistan. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The 73-year-old\u2019s homecoming was lavish. He flew in by chartered jet, surrounded by supporters and journalists. A helicopter then whisked him off to a big rally in Lahore, where his Pakistan Muslim League\u2014Nawaz (PML-N) party launched a new anthem, including the catchy lyric: \u201cTake charge again, save the country, Nawaz Sharif!\u201d Not at all surprisingly, Mr Sharif sounded far more conciliatory towards the generals in his rally speech than he had in exile. \u201cI have no wish for revenge,\u201d he said magnanimously. \u201cNawaz Sharif only wishes for the well-being of the people.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The generals have a habit of reviving Mr Sharif\u2019s career\u2014generally after concluding that his successor was even worse than he was. And so it is again. A general election is due next year and the army is desperate to prevent the party of Imran Khan, a former prime minister and conspiracy theorist who was recently jailed on corruption charges, from winning it. Mr Sharif suddenly doesn\u2019t look too bad by comparison. He has at times played ball with the generals. And given that he will need their support to overturn his various convictions and electoral ban, he may be counted on to do so again. A record fourth term as prime minister could be on the cards."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A stable PML-N government could be relatively good for Pakistan\u2019s economy. The country is in the grip of high inflation and joblessness and serious balance-of-payments problems. An IMF team is due to visit Islamabad next week to discuss releasing the second tranche of a $3bn bail-out\u2014Pakistan\u2019s 23rd by the fund. Mr Sharif is a pragmatic businessman who has support within the Punjabi business establishment. His record suggests he would at least be less flagrantly populist than Mr Khan. His priorities would be stability and growth, insists Khurram Dastgir Khan, a former PML-N commerce minister."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But public opinion is not with the Sharifs. Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s spell as prime minister was doomed by the mismanagement he inherited from Mr Khan. As inflation soared and the rupee crashed, he vacillated, before slashing fuel-price subsidies to woo the IMF. Mr Khan, raging in opposition against the generals and America, which he blames for most things, disassociated himself from the economic mess.

With an approval rating of 60%, he is the country\u2019s most popular leader. \u201cMy friends and I will only vote for Imran Khan,\u201d says Umair, a 32-year-old IT worker in Islamabad. \u201cIf he is disqualified, we will vote for whoever he tells us to vote for.\u201d Knowing which way the wind was blowing, the PML-N supported a delimitation exercise that postponed the election shortly before its government was dissolved in August. Though the election commission has said the vote will be held in late January, a further delay is possible."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The army chief, General Asim Munir, is meanwhile growing increasingly assertive.
