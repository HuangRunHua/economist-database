Britain\u2019s ruling Conservatives recently accused the Labour opposition (falsely) of plans for a \u201cmeat tax\u201d. Poland\u2019s outgoing governing party claimed (absurdly) that its opponents would force people to eat \u201cworms instead of meat\u201d. In France, where consumption per person of meat is twice the global average, the debate has taken a different twist: is it possible to be left-wing and still eat meat?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the home of steak frites, red meat is more than a mere source of protein. It is an expression of muscular national identity; the farming of cattle, a guarantor of rural tradition. Steak, wrote Roland Barthes, a French literary theorist, in 1957, \u201ccommunicates its national glamour\u201d to its junior partner, the self-effacing chip. Over the past decade, however, worries about health and climate change have pushed even the French to eat less red meat. Last year their consumption of chicken overtook that of beef for the first time. In left-leaning, kale-eating quarters, le v\u00e9ganisme is on the rise.

In the fight against climate change, Sandrine Rousseau, a Green party figure, told the Communist chief last month: \u201cYou will not win with a steak.\u201d It was high time, she snapped last year, for the French to stop treating steak as a \u201cvirility symbol\u201d. Meat-eating, retorted Mr Roussel, has nothing to do \u201cwith what you have in your underwear\u201d.

It says they produce 12% of its greenhouse-gas emissions. A third of the French, it also noted, still eat more than the recommended weekly helping of 500 grams of red meat. For now, steak has not entirely lost its glamour, even as it becomes increasingly rare.\u25a0"}], "id": 38}
