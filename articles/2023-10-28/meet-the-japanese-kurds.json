The scene is unremarkable, save for the fact that the boy, Boran, is not Japanese but Kurdish. Warabi and the surrounding area are home to around 2,000 Turkish Kurds, a number that has quadrupled in a decade.

The country\u2019s ageing and shrinking labour force sorely needs fresh blood. Yet Japanese policymakers remain deeply averse to immigration. The result is a largely unacknowledged policy of letting in increasing numbers of immigrants through the back door. Japan\u2019s foreign-born population has tripled since 1990, reaching a record 3m, or 2.4% of the population, in 2022. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Warabi and its environs illustrate the trend. The 40,000 foreign-born residents of Kawaguchi, a neighbouring city, represent 6.8% of its population, a level that would have been unimaginable a decade or two ago. These migrants are essential to the local economy. Yet many are in Japan illegally or on sufferance, as longtime asylum-seekers without work permits. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kawaguchi city is known for its metal-casting industry. Most of its factories now depend on migrants from the Philippines and Vietnam. Kurds first came to the area in the 1990s, looking for economic opportunity and fleeing oppression in Turkey. Many married local women and had children. They have also helped create a hub for demolition firms. \u201cI bet the industry wouldn\u2019t survive without us,\u201d said Ali, a Kurdish asylum-seeker, who worked for a local demolition company for 25 years, rising at 4am to work six days a week.

Thousands do not have valid visas or work permits, and are often detained for overstaying their visas or working illegally.

According to the education ministry, in 2022 around 10,000 of those of school age in Japan were not at school. Komuro Takako, who runs the weekend Japanese classes that Boran was attending, says many schools in Kawaguchi used to reject children who could not write Japanese. Since she started holding the classes seven years ago, things have improved. Yet private schools and colleges still often refuse children of parents without a visa; only a handful of Kurds make it to university.

One recent morning Vakkas Balibay joined his Japanese neighbours to clean Warabi city park, sweeping the pavement for hours. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a thick wall between us and the Japanese people,\u201d says Mr Balibay, who has lived in Warabistan for 22 years.

In June a branch of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) proposed that Kawaguchi\u2019s city council should take steps to crack down on criminal foreigners. \u201cSome local residents feel like they can\u2019t even walk outside because it\u2019s dangerous out there,\u201d says Okutomi Seiichi, who instigated the proposal.

This makes immigrant life precarious, leading to some of the frictions right-wingers cite. \u201cIt\u2019s one-sided to blame the Kurds,\u201d says Nukui Tatsuhiro of Together with Kurds in Japan, a non-profit. Even Mr Okutomi of the ldp puts some of the blame for rowdy Kurds on the government.
