Bush just two decades ago. In place of the \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d, which aimed for a grand bargain to settle the status of illegal migrants, is a paranoid nativism. In place of a foreign policy that saw America as a protector of freedom and democracy is a new doctrine of America First that shuns allies (barring Israel) and would give up on the Ukrainians fighting off a Russian invasion, even when no American soldiers are at risk. The free-traders in the Bush administration entered into trade deals with 13 new countries and tariff rates remained close to zero; Mr Trump wants to put a 10% tariff on all imports.

Republicans unanimously condemned the terrorism and reaffirmed their alliance; they promised to send billions of dollars in security assistance to Israel; and some rattled their sabres at Iran, which sponsors Hamas among other proxies in the region. At the same time, though, much of the party is balking at the prospect of sending arms to Ukraine, which Reagan and both Bushes would surely have done. What happened? The obvious answer is: Mr Trump. But to make sense of this bewildering shift, it helps to look beyond a bit further back."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ever since 1856 the Republican Party has published a party platform every four years as part of its presidential nominating convention\u2014all the way to 2020, when it just re-endorsed the previous one.

When Mr Trump came into office he slapped tariffs on antagonistic countries like China and also friendly ones like South Korea and Canada. The protectionism was a stark reversal from the \u201cneoliberal\u201d days of the 1990s, when the American left and right mostly agreed on expanding global trade. Mr Trump\u2019s universal 10% proposal would bring tariffs on imports back to their highest level since the 1940s (see chart 1)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For much of its history, American industry was safely ensconced under the broad protective tariff of the sort that Mr Trump proposes. The protectionist impulse has roots that run deeper than even the modern two-party system. Henry Clay, the eminent Kentucky senator, championed what he called the \u201cAmerican system\u201d in the early days of the republic. He and his fellow Whigs advocated for protectionist tariffs, heavy infrastructure spending and stable monetary policy through a national bank (then a contentious issue). After the party imploded in the 1850s, Whiggish ideas found their home in the new Republican Party, which had coalesced around halting the expansion of slavery."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cI was an old Henry Clay tariff Whig,\u201d Lincoln wrote in 1859. \u201cIn old times I made more speeches on that subject than on any other.

Republicans remained aligned with incumbent businesses and therefore staunchly protectionist until the second world war. \u201cThe Republican Party stands now, as always, in the fullest sense for the policy of tariff protection to American industries and American labour,\u201d the party wrote in its platform of 1916, protesting against Woodrow Wilson\u2019s reduction of average tariff rates from 40% to 27%. In 1936 the party howled in protest at Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s liberalised trade regime, arguing that \u201cits effect on agriculture and industry has been destructive\u201d."}, {"role": "second", "text": "That\u2019s me in the corner"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Mr Trump returns to office, he has pledged that \u201cthe travel ban [on Muslims] is coming back even bigger than before and much stronger than before\u201d. He has also repeated his aim to end birthright citizenship for children born in America to foreign parents (even though this seems to directly contradict a provision of the 14th Amendment), an urge that seems older. In the 1889 case upholding the plain racial discrimination of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which barred all Chinese labourers for a decade, the Supreme Court wrote in a unanimous opinion that \u201cthe presence of Chinese labourers had a baneful effect upon the material interests of the state, and upon public morals; that their immigration was in numbers approaching the character of an Oriental invasion, and was a menace to our civilisation\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Conservative enthusiasm for immigration has also waxed and waned over the past century\u2014inversely to the level of migration. The Ellis Island era, when millions of Europeans passed the Statue of Liberty on their journey to America, swiftly led to a nativist counterreaction. At the start of the 20th century as many as one in seven American residents were foreign-born\u2014a similar share to the present day. Then as now, much of the opposition was couched in terms of protecting domestic labourers. \u201cIn the further interest of American workmen we favour a more effective restriction of the immigration of cheap labour from foreign lands,\u201d the Republican presidential platform of 1900 argued."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sometimes the motivation was explicitly racial. In 1924 Republicans slammed the country\u2019s borders shut, passing the Johnson-Reed Act that completely banned immigration from Asia and established strict quotas on European migrants. \u201cAmerica must remain American,\u201d said President Calvin Coolidge as he signed the bill into law. Albert Johnson, a congressman and one of the bill\u2019s namesakes, was a prominent eugenicist. \u201cOur capacity to maintain our cherished institutions stands diluted by a stream of alien blood with all its inherited misconceptions,\u201d he said in a committee hearing that year. Migration into America that was once torrential dwindled to a trickle, until the policy was reversed in 1965 by Lyndon Johnson."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This too became a cross-party consensus. When he accepted the Republican nomination for president in 1980, Reagan adhered to the standard American dogma on migration, which lionises immigrants past while expressing some scepticism towards immigrants present and future. \u201cCan we doubt\u201d, he asked, \u201cthat only a divine providence placed this land, this island of freedom, here as a refuge for all those people in the world who yearn to breathe free?\u201d As president, he signed a law in 1986 that sought to solve the problem of illegal immigration by granting amnesty to those already in the country while stiffening border security and employer checks on work eligibility.

So it is with the isolationist strain within American conservatism. The most ardent supporters of Mr Trump see foreign entanglements\u2014even pledged alliances\u2014as pointless distractions. One of the reasons that the berserker caucus of the Republican Party defenestrated Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House, was their strong opposition to continued military aid to Ukraine.

In one recent vote on a bill that would fund training for Ukrainian military officers, a majority of Republicans in the House were opposed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the start of the 20th century, too, Republicans were staunchly sceptical of multilateralism.

Woodrow Wilson famously outlined the Fourteen Points in his address to Congress\u2014among them \u201ceconomic free trade on the seas during war and peace\u201d and the creation of the League of Nations. Yet America never joined because of Republican opposition. In the 1930s Gerald Nye, a prominent Republican senator, urged the passage of several neutrality acts making the export of arms to warring nations illegal. The original America First Committee was led by isolationists, including the aviator Charles Lindbergh, wanting to prevent entry into the second world war.

In a speech published in 1951 castigating America\u2019s entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the predecessor of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and the Korean war, he stated his objection plainly: \u201cIf in the great field of foreign policy the president has arbitrary and unlimited power, as he now claims, then there is an end to freedom in the United States in a great realm of domestic activity.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For all the attention lavished on Reagan as an ideological transformer of the party, too little is paid to Eisenhower in reshaping the party for the modern age.

It blamed the Truman administration for abandoning the friendly nations of Eastern Europe to Soviet aggression; it pledged to use its \u201cfriendly influence\u201d in Western Europe to actually contain further advances of communism."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Taft had triumphed, it would certainly have read differently. \u201cTaft dying [one year later, in 1953] is important,\u201d says Matthew Continetti, a scholar of conservative thought at the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank. \u201cAnd the echo of that is in 2018, when John McCain dies.

Persuasion had something to do with it, certainly. But the essential glue may have been great-power competition with the Soviet Union, when capitalism became synonymous with freedom.

By the time of Reagan\u2019s presidency, their arguments had become entrenched: \u201cThe Republican Party believes that protectionist tariffs and quotas are detrimental to our economic wellbeing,\u201d according to the 1980 manifesto."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although Reagan remains beatified within the party, the institutions he was aligned with have changed. The clearest example is the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think-tank that once functioned as the external brain for the Reagan White House. It is seeking to reprise the role for a possible Republican administration in 2025, preparing detailed policy manifestos and pre-screening personnel\u2014but with a much more populist orientation. Heritage is still concerned about the size and cost of government spending generally and welfare programmes specifically. But the old free-trade agenda now has a large, China-shaped caveat. Once an exceptionally hawkish outfit, and among the most fulsome supporters for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Heritage is perhaps the most influential organisation in Washington that is rallying against additional American spending on Ukraine."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Trying to keep up with you"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s expensive to be engaged in neoconservative adventurism,\u201d says Kevin Roberts, the president of Heritage, about the reason for the shift.
