However, there is another Ken Burns effect that is far more important. For 40-odd years Mr Burns has focused America\u2019s attention on some of its most difficult chapters."}, {"role": "body", "text": "His breakout series, \u201cThe Civil War\u201d (1990), was watched by nearly 40m viewers on public television, then a record; visits to battlefields more than doubled the next year, says Mr Burns. A bump in visitors also followed \u201cThe National Parks\u201d series in 2009. Mr Burns\u2019s subjects include biographies of Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Jefferson, as well as histories of baseball, jazz, slavery and the Vietnam war. His aim, he says, is to tell the unsanitised story of his country."}, {"role": "body", "text": "His latest, \u201cThe American Buffalo\u201d, takes on a double tragedy: the wanton slaughter of buffaloes living in the Great Plains during the late 19th century and the parallel near-extinction of the Native American tribes that evolved alongside these shaggy beasts for 10,000 years. Steeped in Native American perspectives, it is a tale of destruction and partial recovery unfamiliar to most Americans."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Cheyenne had 27 words for the animal, which a Spanish conquistador in the 16th century described as numberless as the fish in the sea. The buffalo sustained Native Americans, who used every piece. \u201cWe are brothers, we are related,\u201d M. Scott Momaday, a Kiowa poet, says in the film. \u201cWe have regard for each other.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That regard was trampled by the voracious appetite of an expanding United States. Between 1805, when Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first traversed the continent, and the 1860s, the buffalo\u2019s numbers fell from probably 30m-60m to fewer than 15m. Then, over the next decade, they were almost wiped out. Sharpshooters arrived on the new railroads, seeking hides for leather belts in industrial machines. Buffaloes were \u201clike walking gold pieces\u201d, exclaimed one of those hunters."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Years later, Theodore Roosevelt wrote that \u201cthe extermination of the buffalo was the only way of solving the Indian question.\u201d Though never an explicit policy, historians agree that army and political leaders tacitly approved of exterminating buffaloes in order to force Native Americans to move to reservations. A quarter of the Blackfeet tribe starved; it was \u201ca death wind for my people\u201d, said Chief Sitting Bull of the Lakota Sioux. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In its more uplifting second half, the film looks at efforts to save the buffalo from extinction: by tribal people, conservationists, white supremacists and former hunters haunted by regret. At a time when American history is often contested, Mr Burns says documentaries such as this one have \u201cthe possibility of reminding people how complex and contradictory our story is\u201d.\u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 70}
