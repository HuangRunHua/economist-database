Its population of around 213m, the biggest in Africa, has some 37m hectares of fertile land. But it grows too little on it.

To feed Nigeria\u2019s own people, let alone markets abroad, farmers will have to cut back on their use of some chemicals. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "That will not be easy, since Nigeria is one of the continent\u2019s leaders at splurging on pesticides, importing some $384m-worth in 2018 alone to kill bugs and weeds. Yet 58% of the pesticides registered for use in Nigeria are banned in Europe because of their toxicity. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Sometimes the chemicals are so strong that they don\u2019t only wipe out pests and other crop-predators; they can kill people. In 2020 some 270 people in a village in Benue state died after fishermen using chemicals to catch fish had dumped some of them into the community\u2019s main water source. Scientists at several Nigerian universities argue that dangerous pesticides and other agrochemicals are contributing to rising rates of cancer, which kills as many as 79,000 Nigerians a year. A recent study found that roughly 80% of the pesticides most commonly used by small-scale farmers are highly hazardous."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFarmers use what\u2019s available and recommended to them,\u201d taking advice from marketers and traders, says Jochen Luckscheiter of the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, an NGO tied to Germany\u2019s Green party. \u201cIf you want to stop them, you have to stop the supply\u2014and make alternative products available.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In August environmental activists and politicians gathered in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital, to review the current laws on importing and using pesticides\u2014and discovered that hardly any exist.

By contrast with these challenges, it ought to be easy to regulate pesticides so they do not poison people. \u25a0"}], "id": 31}
