The question is all the more acute now that America also seeks to defend Israel. In Mr Biden\u2019s view, helping friends is not only possible but necessary. \u201cAmerican leadership is what holds the world together,\u201d he declared. \u201cAmerican alliances are what keep us, America, safe.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet academics debate whether and when the \u201cunipolar\u201d world, in which America bestrode the globe after the cold war, reverted to a \u201cbipolar\u201d one, in which America is challenged by China rather than the Soviet Union; or whether it is already a \u201cmultipolar\u201d world.

Palestinians say the carnage was caused by an Israeli strike; Israel said it was the result of an errant Palestinian missile. Mr Biden seemed to give Israel the benefit of the doubt (and later said more firmly that it was not responsible). The Arab leaders did not.

He borrowed the protectionist mindset of his predecessor, Donald Trump, and added large doses of subsidies and industrial policy to promote, among other things, green technology and the manufacture of semiconductors. Gratifyingly, the American economy has outperformed that of its rich-world peers. He hoped such policies would reduce social and political polarisation. He also hoped they would fortify America in its contest with China. Describing the era as one of \u201ccompetition in an age of interdependence\u201d, Mr Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, says foreign and domestic policies are more interconnected than ever, for instance in efforts to restrict China\u2019s access to advanced technology."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Abroad, Mr Biden sought to revitalise alliances that Mr Trump had either neglected or threatened to undo.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Above all Mr Biden\u2019s foreign policy meant doing much less in the Middle East, a region that had consumed the energies of many an American president. He sought to end the \u201cforever wars\u201d in Iraq and Afghanistan. He promised to restore the nuclear deal with Iran, which Barack Obama had signed in 2015 and Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, to contain the danger of a nuclear Iran. He initially said Saudi Arabia should be treated as a \u201cpariah\u201d.

Far from being stable and predictable, Mr Putin invaded Ukraine and information exchanges under New start are suspended. America\u2019s chaotic departure from Afghanistan allowed the Taliban to return to power instantly.

The president could not persuade the de facto ruler of the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter to help moderate oil prices; instead, Saudi Arabia cleaved to a production deal with Russia to keep prices high. Moreover, he set a high bar for the normalisation of relations with Israel that Mr Biden hoped to bring about: concessions on the Palestinian question; a mutual-defence agreement with America; and uranium enrichment at home to counterbalance Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.

The West went on to win the cold war."}, {"role": "body", "text": "These days the question is whether America\u2019s pell-mell departure from Afghanistan undermined American credibility and encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine. Tod Wolters, a former military commander of NATO forces, suggested last year that it had been one of several factors.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "As for military capacity, America must supply weapons to Ukraine, Taiwan and now Israel. That raises doubts about whether its defence industries can meet their needs as well as its own. In general America sends different weapons to the three countries, but some demands overlap. For instance, 155mm artillery shells are in short supply, and America is reported to have diverted a consignment intended for Ukraine to Israel. The war in Ukraine has shown how big state-on-state conflicts consume vast quantities of munitions. War games suggest that, in a war over Taiwan, America would quickly run out of the long-range anti-ship missiles that would be most useful in repelling a Chinese invasion of Taiwan."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such problems can be solved with time and money, but both are in short supply because of America\u2019s polarisation and congressional paralysis. Republicans, especially those of Mr Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d tendency, have grown ever more sceptical about supporting Ukraine in its war. And Congress, unable to pass bills since the removal of the speaker of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, on October 3rd, got a new one, Mike Johnson, only this week."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Biden hopes cross-party sympathy for Israel will unblock things. He has asked Congress for a massive $106bn in supplemental national-security spending. He seeks to pre-empt future divisive votes on Ukraine by allocating $61bn in military and economic aid to the country, to tide it through America\u2019s febrile 2024 election season. To make it more palatable, he has wrapped it in other spending that Republicans should find more appealing, including $14bn for Israel; $2bn for military-equipment transfers in the Indo-Pacific (probably to Taiwan); nearly $12bn in various measures to strengthen the processing of migrants on the southern border; and $3bn for the submarine defence-industrial base.

Yet Israel\u2019s war is different from Ukraine\u2019s in several respects. One concerns international perceptions. America helps Ukraine in the name of the UN charter, the inviolability of sovereign borders and human rights. In defending Israel, America is backing a country that breaches international law by building Jewish settlements in occupied territories, rejects statehood for Palestinians and stands accused of imposing collective punishments on Palestinians, if not committing war crimes, in its bombardment and siege of Gaza."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Middle East rules"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whereas the Western allies are almost united in defence of Ukraine, they are split on the question of Palestine. A UN Security Council resolution calling for \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d in the fighting in Gaza was supported by France and 11 other countries, but drew an abstention by Britain (alongside Russia) and was vetoed outright by America, on the ground that it did not recognise Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A second factor is America\u2019s own role. In Europe it is acting at arm\u2019s length, sending weapons, intelligence and money to Ukraine, but not troops. In the Middle East it is deploying its own forces to protect Israel from attack by Iran and its allies. Mr Biden\u2019s embrace of Israel is sincerely felt\u2014Mr Biden calls himself a Zionist\u2014but is also an attempt to influence and restrain Israel. \u201cIf Biden\u2019s hugging strategy works in delivering a more calibrated Israeli response, people will see it as Biden\u2019s special flair,\u201d says Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think-tank. \u201cIf it does not work, America is going to be seen as a warring party.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Regional dynamics add a further element. Arab states are ambiguous. Many detest Hamas, as a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood that challenges their rule, and have made peace with Israel, or have tacit relations with it.

Indeed, they fear Israel secretly wants to resolve its problem by pushing out more Palestinians."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The crisis in Gaza, notes Mr Hokayem, has shifted attention back to Palestine after years of American efforts to ignore it, or to solve it from the \u201coutside in\u201d, ie, normalising relations between Israel and Arab states and only then dealing with the Palestinians themselves. Yet the endgame in Gaza is being left intentionally blank. Israel insists Hamas must not rule Gaza again; America says Israel must not occupy it again. Neither says what the alternative might be. Mr Netanyahu, moreover, has done his utmost to sabotage Palestinian statehood. After Hamas\u2019s onslaught he, and many Israelis, will be even more convinced that it poses a mortal danger.

The two-state model, says Mr Hokayem, \u201cwas a preference, not a policy\u201d. If a solution seems impossible, it is only in part because of the inherent difficulty of reconciling two nationalist imperatives, Israeli and Palestinian, on the same hallowed land. It is also \u201cthe cost of American retrenchment\u201d, says Mr Hokayem. \u201cIt is more difficult for America to come back into the game having been outside for a long time.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "China and Russia may offer no substitute for America\u2019s diplomacy, but they will be more than happy to see American discomfiture and will play up the claims of American double standards.

Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim country, inevitably sympathises with Palestinians.
