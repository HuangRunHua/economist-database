A study of Swedish bosses found that the typical head of a large firm was in the top 17% of the population by IQ. But across all layers of management, the emphasis has gradually shifted towards softer social skills, such as clear communication, ability to build trust and willingness to show vulnerability. Executives, including CEOs, need to be comfortable with uncertainty, and happy to delegate even the strategic responsibilities that they would once have hogged, observes Nitin Nohria, a former dean of HBS.

A study of executive job listings, by Raffaella Sadun of HBS and colleagues, found that between 2000 and 2017 descriptions mentioning social skills rose by nearly 30%. Those singling out an ability to manage financial and material resources declined by 40% (see chart 1). The most common goals requested by firms that employ management coaches for their managers on EZRA, Adecco\u2019s coaching platform, include communication, emotional intelligence, building trust and collaboration. One of the hottest courses at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business is \u201cTouchy Feely\u201d, which teaches students to assess how they come across to others."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Social skills are increasingly sought-after because they enable better co-ordination of people, goals and resources. And 21st-century business requires more such co-ordination than ever. Managers once used to supervise individuals performing repetitive tasks. Today they often oversee professionals working in teams on complicated projects with outcomes that are hard to measure with precision. The world outside the firm is becoming more complex, too. All this means that, as Mr Deming remarks, \u201cit takes more time to converge on a decision.\u201d A good manager, whose main role boils down to that of co-ordinator, can cut this time. This ability to get disparate people and goals to coalesce smoothly is thus at a premium, especially relative to purely intellectual and technical skills. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "One thing making co-ordination harder is an otherwise welcome development\u2014greater workforce diversity. For much of the 20th century in America the manager and the managed were the same white men. \u201cYou used to run mini-mes,\u201d says Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University. That, Ms Sadun notes, meant managers could be assumed to possess an implicit \u201ctheory of mind\u201d of their underlings\u2014an intuitive understanding of how they thought and felt about the world.

In America, women make up 42% of managers, up from 38.5% in 2010. Between 2013 and 2022 the share of non-whites in managerial posts has risen from 14% to over 18% (see chart 2). Women and non-whites are still underrepresented in such roles, relative to their share of America\u2019s population; non-white employees in particular are likelier than white colleagues to leave a job because they didn\u2019t feel they belonged at their companies. But progress is undeniable. Diversity has, says Mr Nohria, \u201ccaught up with us\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The problem for managers, be they women or men, white or not, is that putting yourself in subordinates\u2019 shoes is no longer automatic. Because you cannot assume you know what others are thinking, you need keen social \u201cantennae\u201d, Mr Nohria observes. Hybrid work, where managers, in Mr Bloom\u2019s words, \u201cadjudicate private lives\u201d via decisions about home-working, makes the task even more delicate."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like diversity, the post-pandemic spread of remote work brings benefits while raising co-ordination costs. Running a workforce virtually imposes what organisational scholars call \u201cmanagement overhead\u201d. Even when the network connection is not patchy and people don\u2019t forget to unmute themselves, virtual meetings strip out lots of signals, such as eye-contact and gestures. They are more tiring; one study found that people speak more loudly on Zoom than face-to-face. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "And they are taking up more and more of managers\u2019 time. A study by Microsoft of 31,000 corporate users of its 365 office software in 31 countries found that in March 2023 the average person participated in three times as many Teams video-conferencing meetings and calls as in February 2020. In roughly the same period the typical user sent 32% more chat messages. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The number of unscheduled calls rose by 8% between 2020 and 2022, to 64% of all Teams meetings. Some 60% of such encounters are now under 15 minutes. Shorter activities probably mean more interruptions, says Ms Sadun. Two in three workers in the Microsoft study complained they did not have enough uninterrupted focus time during the workday. \u201cWork has become more staccato,\u201d sums up Jared Spataro, who oversaw the research at Microsoft. That, Ms Sadun adds, imposes a heavy cognitive cost\u2014and may explain some of the troubling burnout numbers. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Focus is scarcer for executives, too, including CEOs. When Ms Sadun and co-authors looked at how 1,100 bosses in six countries spent their time, they discovered that only a quarter of their working days involved being alone, and some of that was taken up by writing emails. A long-running study of 27 leading chief executives\u2019 time use by Mr Nohria and Michael Porter found that bosses often used long-haul travel to think. The post-pandemic decline in business trips means there is less of this time to recoup. If the composition of executives\u2019 working hours reflects the relative value of the things those hours consume, then co-ordination outweighs pondering strategy.

Ever since ChatGPT, an artificially intelligent chatbot developed by a startup called OpenAI, took the world by storm a year ago, progress in AI has kicked up a notch.

The comparative value of the non-artificial intelligence required to perform them may decline.
