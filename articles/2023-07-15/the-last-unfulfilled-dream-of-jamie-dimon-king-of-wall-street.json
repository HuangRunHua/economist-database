The boss of JPMorgan Chase has just returned from a long July 4th holiday weekend with his large and growing family: his wife, three daughters, a gaggle of grandchildren. He has little patience for the faff that accompanies a filmed interview\u2014the reason that he, his handlers, a film crew, your columnist and The Economist\u2019s editor-in-chief have gathered at the New York headquarters of America\u2019s biggest bank. Mr Dimon does not want to loiter in the hallway for his \u201cwalking-in\u201d shot; nor is he going to wait to be properly miked up and seated in his chair before launching into conversation about public policy. \u201cSo, should we do this?\u201d he urges."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Doing things is the Dimon way. He is impatient, opportunistic, pragmatic: the type of person to just get on with it. When his 12th-grade calculus teacher left, he taught himself. Fresh out of business school he took a job at American Express, because he wanted to build something rather than merely move money around. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "What he has crafted over nearly 18 years at the helm of JPMorgan Chase is the banking equivalent of the Palace of Versailles or the Taj Mahal. It is America\u2019s most successful bank\u2014and, with a market capitalisation of $435bn, by far the most valuable in the world. Under Mr Dimon\u2019s stewardship its shareholders have earned a handsome annual return of 10.6%\u2014double that of most other big lenders. Its investment bank ranks in the top three in almost all businesses it cares to compete in. Its commercial bank is the biggest in America. Because it is so large\u2014and because banks in America with more than 10% of all deposits are barred from acquiring more (unless they rescue a failing bank, as JPMorgan did with First Republic in April)\u2014it can grow only slowly. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not much left to do, then, for a man prone to doing. (A literal construction project, his bank\u2019s new headquarters on Park Avenue, probably barely scratches Mr Dimon\u2019s itch.) Instead, he has turned his seemingly inexhaustible energies to other problems. He skips over the banking mini-crisis (mostly resolved) or the risk of recession (it could be mild, or maybe not; either way, he worries more about Ukraine and food security in Africa). He is most animated about other topics: social mobility, de-escalating global conflicts and defending capitalism, which he suggests is unfairly maligned. His annual letters to shareholders, once limited to thoughts on management and banking, now contain more policy ruminations than the typical American political campaign."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He offers solutions for the problems he most wishes America could solve. For social mobility he would expand earned-income tax credits and returns repeatedly to griping about the cost of education. \u201cWe need to do a better job with our community colleges,\u201d he argues. \u201cWe should be making it cheaper, not more expensive.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Dimon craves an open dialogue with China, which he does not think America, as by far the more prosperous country, should fear. The Chinese are not \u201cten feet tall\u201d. They import oil, lack food security, are poorer and have weaker armed forces. \u201cMaybe they have caught up in a couple of areas, but the notion that somehow America has to be that afraid of China: we don\u2019t.\u201d He sees the shift towards industrial policy to protect national security as wise. But America must be careful with tools such as export controls. \u201cIf it relates to supersonic missiles, I think we should do it. If it relates to holding down the Chinese people, I think we shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Despite his early support for the idea of \u201cstakeholder value\u201d, which considers how companies treat their workers, suppliers, the society at large or the environment, he is no woke capitalist. Rather, he is a pragmatist. All chief executives try to have the best products or services, they need great employees and to keep their customers happy, he argues. \u201cThis was just humanising business, that we take care of our customers, or employees or crews or whatever.\u201d That doesn\u2019t make him anything but a \u201cred-blooded, full-throated, free-enterprise, patriotic American\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Dimon\u2019s interest in public policy, resolve, resources and ambition all point in one direction: political office. Speculation about a presidential run has bubbled up over the years. But it is an idea he quickly shoots down. \u201cI have never really believed I am particularly suited for it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere may be common skills\u2026 in terms of administration, management, leadership, but those are not uncommon.\u201d Knowing how to navigate political arenas or how to campaign is harder. Mr Dimon thinks switching from business to politics is tricky. \u201cI think it\u2019s very hard to do. And in fact, if we just look at history, it\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d President Donald Trump was the exception, not the rule. And that is not intended as a compliment. \u201cI would worry about another Trump presidency,\u201d he says. For America to turn inwards and abdicate its position in the world would be a huge mistake.

To me, my family comes first. But my country is right next,\u201d he explains. \u201cJPMorgan is down here,\u201d he adds, gesturing lower down. The realist in him probably knows an appointment to the Treasury, the most obvious post, is unlikely. The path from Wall Street to government is not as well-trodden as it used to be. Democrats have long been suspicious of high finance, and Republicans have grown more so under the populist Mr Trump. \u201cJPMorgan is the best contribution I can do,\u201d Mr Dimon insists. \u201cWe have 300,000 employees. We take care of them well and we give them opportunities.\u201d A politician couldn\u2019t have said it better. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the Bottom Line, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 51}
