His previous novel, \u201cDeath Is Hard Work\u201d, dealt with the carnage of his country\u2019s civil war, which began in 2011. \u201cNo One Prayed Over Their Graves\u201d, a family saga, takes place in and around Aleppo, a historic city ruined by that conflict. The novel, which covers the period between 1881 and 1951, tells the multigenerational story of two Aleppo families \u201cintricately entwined\u201d despite differences of creed, class and character. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The landowning Bayazidis are Muslim, the trading Gregoroses, Christian. Their family friends, notably Azar, an architect, are Jews. In 1907 a deadly flood inflicts deep \u201cscars of loss\u201d on these close-knit clans. The waters engulf a village on the city\u2019s outskirts where Zakariya Bayazidi and Hanna Gregoros, pals since childhood, have built houses. The catastrophe anchors an intricate plot that ranges from late 19th-century Ottoman imperial rule to Syrian independence after 1946."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In this Aleppo, faith seldom dictates actions and affections: as children, Hanna and Zakariya \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less about their religions\u201d. Yet external events\u2014from the slaughter of much of the Gregoros family to the Armenian genocide\u2014sometimes force it centre-stage. Although this strife-torn \u201cmagical city\u201d is no multicultural idyll, passion or friendship breaches sectarian barriers. Maryam, an Armenian survivor who works with Zakariya\u2019s sister, Souad, reflects that \u201cwalls portrayed our identity.\u201d In this novel, characters find joy, and take risks, by jumping over them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Characters do not hold fast to dogma. In later life, Hanna acquires a reputation for being especially devout but privately thinks of Jesus simply as \u201ca luminous idea held up for all humanity\u201d. Yvonne, lover of the married Zakariya, \u201cbelieved nothing and lived in doubt\u201d. Even the holy Father Ibrahim nurses sceptical ideas."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Love stories\u2014thwarted, tragic or ecstatic\u2014help bring a many-stranded plot together. At its symbolic heart lies the scandalous affair, \u201calmost a fairy-tale\u201d, of William Eisa\u2014a Christian school friend of Hanna\u2019s and Zakariya\u2019s\u2014and Aisha Mufti, a Muslim girl. They elope, and her enraged Ottoman fianc\u00e9 murders both of them. Such disasters leave unhealed wounds. Maryam, who marries a Turkish banker but nurtures a \u201csilent love\u201d for Zakariya\u2019s photographer son, reflects that \u201csurvival is a journey through a trackless wilderness.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Maryam also frets that in venerable Aleppo, with its souks, mosques, churches and citadels, \u201cAll inanimate objects were immortal.\u201d For her, these hallowed edifices \u201cconspired to erase the great stories\u201d of the citizens themselves. After the violence and horrors of recent years, such passages have a bitterly ironic taste.

Yet his galloping narration restores life and soul to a city that has become a byword for devastation. Leri Price, who also translated \u201cDeath Is Hard Work\u201d from Arabic, has produced an English text of grace, pace and gusto.
