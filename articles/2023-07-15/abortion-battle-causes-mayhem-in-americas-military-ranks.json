This week, though, it has no occupant for the first time in more than a century. General David Berger, the outgoing chief, retired on July 10th. His deputy, Eric Smith, cannot move in because the Senate has not confirmed him. He holds the job in an acting capacity, with limitations, and has no deputy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Similarly his would-be boss, General Charles \u201cCQ\u201d Brown, the air-force chief, is in a holding pattern as the Senate delays his appointment to succeed Mark Milley as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. All told, about 275 nominations of generals and flag officers, including front-line commanders, have been halted. About 650 are liable to be stymied by the end of the year, with a knock-on impact down the chains of promotion, not to mention the disruption to staff and families. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The world\u2019s mightiest fighting machine finds itself obstructed by a former college-football coach, Tommy Tuberville, a Republican senator from Alabama. A devotee of the former president, Donald Trump, he has struggled to decide whether white nationalists are racists. \u201cCoach\u201d Tuberville\u2019s reason for running interference against military officers? To protest against the Pentagon\u2019s policy of giving leave to, and paying the travel expenses of, servicewomen seeking abortions outside the states where they are deployed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "His \u201chold\u201d on senior appointments is the most disruptive act yet in Republicans\u2019 efforts to take the culture wars to the military domain, after skirmishes over vaccines, race and transgender issues. Democrats accuse the senator of harming military readiness and morale. Mitch McConnell, the Republicans\u2019 Senate leader, rejects his move; other Republicans have tried to talk him out of it. All to no avail."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Senator Tuberville claims his hold affects \u201conly those at the very top\u201d, not the fighting force. General Brown disagrees. \u201cWe will lose talent,\u201d he told senators on July 11th. It is hardly the first time a senator has halted confirmations for political leverage. But Peter Feaver of Duke University notes that military appointments are treated with greater regard than civilian ones. They may be blocked over allegations of improper behaviour, say, but not usually on a matter of policy or on such a scale. \u201cThis senatorial privilege is meant to be surgical. Instead it\u2019s being used as a broadaxe,\u201d he says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s overturning last year of Roe v Wade, allowing states to ban or curtail abortion, affected many servicewomen deployed to conservative states. Under federal law the Pentagon can still offer abortions in cases of rape, incest or when the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Senator Tuberville objects to the Pentagon\u2019s decision in February to \u201cfacilitate\u201d travel for out-of-state abortions. This amounts to using federal funds to \u201csubsidise\u201d elective abortion in contravention of the Hyde amendment, he argues."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Military appointments are usually confirmed briskly in batches by \u201cunanimous consent\u201d of the Senate. If a member voices an objection, as Senator Tuberville has done 11 times, the Senate can still confirm nominees by the more laborious means of individual votes on each candidate. That takes up valuable floor time from other priorities, such as legislation. Another option, formalising the Pentagon\u2019s policy through legislation, is unlikely to pass in a divided Congress. With both sides dug in, Democrats will hope to gain if Republicans soil their reputation as champions of the armed forces."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Feaver proposes giving \u201cmilitary non-combatants immunity in the culture wars\u201d. Politicians can challenge civilians who decide on policy, but not serving officers who implement it. In return, military folk should stay out of politics. General Brown, the second African-American officer ever to be nominated for the top job, promises to do just that. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the best African-American F-16 pilot. I wanted to be the best F-16 pilot,\u201d he told his confirmation hearing. If Coach Tuberville has his way, though, General Brown will be grounded for some time. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters."}], "id": 25}
