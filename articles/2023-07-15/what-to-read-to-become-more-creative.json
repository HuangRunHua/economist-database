Although associated with certain qualities\u2014imagination, originality, artistic flair\u2014it defies easy definition. Many philosophers contend that if a product (an artwork, a technological invention, a mathematical solution or a mere idea) is creative, it must be both new and valuable. Intention is also important: most would agree that a snowflake is not creative, nor a work composed by artificial intelligence. But beyond that there is little consensus. Explanations for where it originates range from the dreaming subconscious to wide-eyed attentiveness; from ponderous reflection to the bright flash of insight; from godly inspiration to grinding toil. Plato wrote that poets are inspired by the Muses in a divine madness, whereas Aristotle considered their work to be rational and focused on outcomes. Immanuel Kant thought creativity had to be both \u201coriginal\u201d\u2014since \u201cthere can be original nonsense\u201d\u2014and \u201cexemplary\u201d, born of an innate imaginative capacity. For Friedrich Nietzsche it was a balancing act between a \u201cDionysian\u201d ecstasy and \u201cApollonian\u201d robustness. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet creativity is enormously sought after. A poll of over 1,500 CEOs in 2010 ranked it as the most important leadership quality for success in business; the World Economic Forum has called creativity \u201cthe one skill that will future-proof you for the jobs market\u201d. Nor is it just lucrative: creativity promises self-fulfilment, happiness and moral good in and of itself. These books provide clarity on what it is and where to find it.

Few people would associate him with \u201ccreative blockage\u201d. Yet in his 50s that is what he experienced. Salvation emerged in the form of a \u201cdream diary\u201d, in which he let his imagination run unbounded by the strictures of external judgment. \u201cThere are no witnesses,\u201d Greene wrote in the introduction to \u201cA World of My Own\u201d, a selection of his favourite dreams that was published in 1992, shortly after his death. \u201cNo libel actions. The characters I meet there have no memory of meeting me, no journalist or would-be biographer can check my account with another\u2019s.\u201d Despite featuring Prince Philip in a scoutmaster\u2019s uniform and Pope John Paul II in a hotel room, the dreams are mostly quotidian: there is \u201cnever terror, never nightmare\u201d writes Greene, nor \u201cthe erotic side of life\u201d\u2014which at points makes for rather dull reading. But the book is a reminder that it is possible to rise above the quicksand of creative block by freeing oneself from the impulses of perfectionism and self-doubt.

As a creativity manual it is remarkably practical, sanguine and democratic. Ms Cameron recommends two practices for \u201cartistic recovery\u201d: the morning pages, a daily ritual of writing three sides of paper of stream-of-consciousness, and \u201cartist dates\u201d, solo expeditions to inspire creative connections through frivolity each week. The remaining 11 chapters, intended to be worked through a week at a time, include exercises to spur inspiration and mitigate self-doubt in a \u201cteachable, trackable\u201d manner. Anyone can be an artist, Ms Cameron passionately affirms, so long as they manage to unblock their artistic sensibility through practical exercises. The book is now something of a cult classic: it has sold over 5m copies, after a surge in sales during the pandemic, with creative types including Alicia Keys and Patricia Cornwell lauding it as the source of their success."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Wired to Create: Unravelling the Mysteries of the Creative Mind.

There was no clear progression: some of the first images he sketched appeared in the piece, and he reworked them even once he\u2019d started painting. For Scott Barry Kaufman, a cognitive psychologist and scientific director of the Imagination Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, and Carolyn Gregoire, a science writer for the Huffington Post, Picasso\u2019s process is symbolic of the chaotic act of creation: \u201cIt\u2019s likely that Picasso did not quite know where he was going, creatively, until he arrived there.\u201d In this fascinating tour of recent research into creativity, they find that its impulse is rarely, if ever, ordered or linear. Instead it \u201cis a process that reflects our fundamentally chaotic and multifaceted nature\u201d. Charting recent developments in neuroscience and psychology, they focus on ten things that highly creative people do differently, from daydreaming to cultivating solitude. The result is a lively, inspiring and scientifically rigorous glimpse into the workings of the creative mind. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Imagination Muscle. By Albert Read.

Sweeping from a 73,000-year-old drawing on a stone in the Blombos Cave, the world\u2019s earliest known sketch, to the modern corporate world, Mr Read attempts to pin down the imagination\u2019s \u201cconstant mercurial nature; how it evolves in power and shape\u201d. He does not quite succeed: the book is more convincing when revelling in the imagination\u2019s power and importance than when dissecting precisely how it works. But it is a moving hymn to creativity that can act as its own \u201cPromethean spark that ignites the imaginative flame\u201d. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Cult of Creativity. By Samuel Franklin. University of Chicago Press; 264 pages; $26 and \u00a320"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Where did the concept of creativity come from? And why is it valued so highly? One answer is posited by Samuel Franklin\u2019s provocative new book. Mr Franklin, a cultural historian at Delft University of Technology, argues that today\u2019s idea of creativity was invented in the 1950s as \u201ca psychological cure for these structural and political contradictions of the post-war order\u201d. Although the idea of imagination has been around since time immemorial, the first known written instance of \u201ccreativity\u201d appeared in 1875, and people only began to refer to it regularly from the mid-20th century. Mr Franklin cogently argues that creativity became a buzzword because it was a way to retool white-collar workers for a service economy\u2014one that rewarded branding, research and development instead of Fordian manufacturing. \u201cThe concept of creativity,\u201d he concludes, \u201cnever actually existed outside of capitalism.\u201d Meanwhile it was adopted by politicians as a way to emphasise corporate America\u2019s individualism in contrast with Soviet conformity, and by psychologists as a means of curing post-war feelings of alienation. Tracing its history, Mr Franklin maps how creativity became viewed by artists, CEOs, tech bros and kindergarten teachers as \u201ca cult object, something we project all of our desires and anxieties onto, imbued with almost mystical powers, and beyond rebuke\u201d. His book is an antidote for anyone who has sat, pen in hand, struggling to locate their \u201cdivine muse\u201d.
