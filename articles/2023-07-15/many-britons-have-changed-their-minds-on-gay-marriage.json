The landmark social reform, which was passed by the House of Commons on July 17th 2013, did not appear in any party\u2019s manifesto for the election in 2010. The resulting coalition government initially said it would retain a ban on gay marriage. In his memoirs the former prime minister admitted that he had gone on \u201ca journey\u201d; one that caused him to \u201cworry and even wobble\u201d.

Indeed, same-sex marriage has proved remarkably popular. As of 2020, the most recent year for which there is data, more than 42,000 gay couples in England and Wales had tied the knot. (Scotland and Northern Ireland passed separate laws.) Polling in June found that more than three-quarters of Britons now support gay marriage, up from just over half in 2012. Just 14% are opposed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The success of same-sex marriage legislation shows how political leaders can shape and accelerate deeper shifts in public opinion. Britons have long been becoming more liberal and less religious. The previous New Labour government had done much to sweep away repressive legislation. It ended Section 28, which prevented schools and local authorities from \u201cpromoting homosexuality\u201d and introduced civil partnerships. Campaigners were pushing for more."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nevertheless, Mr Cameron chose to confront his party on a subject many would rather have avoided. \u201cI don\u2019t support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support [it] because I\u2019m a Conservative\u201d, he told his party\u2019s annual conference in 2011. The government proceeded carefully, conducting a consultation which elicited the largest ever response. Still, Conservative mps attempted wrecking amendments and 134 voted against the bill, which meant that Mr Cameron had to rely on opposition votes. But the law was changed, and attitudes changed with it. Gay marriages became not an abstract threat but something undertaken by friends, colleagues, neighbours. Almost half of Britons now say they know a married gay couple. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "This change reveals some deeper shifts. Gordon Brown, Mr Cameron\u2019s predecessor, opposed gay marriage in office because it was \u201cintimately bound up with questions of religious freedom\u201d. Many others across the House did, too. Few would now admit to such a view. Danny Kruger, a Conservative mp, told a recent conference on \u201cnational conservativism\u201d that marriages between men and women were \u201cthe only possible basis for a safe and successful society\u201d. But there appears little constituency for such a message in Britain now. Number 10 quickly shot down the remarks. Like most successful and enduring policies same-sex marriage has moved beyond contention. Though Britain was not the first to legalise it, 19 other countries have since given gay marriage their blessing. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "A thornier legacy concerns the relationship between church and state. The government designed the law to ensure no organisation or minister could be forced to marry same-sex couples. That pleased the Church of England and helped the bill\u2019s passage through Parliament. But it has led to a decade of ecclesiastical discord as liberal members of the church argue for the right to perform or partake in gay marriages. A fudge in which the church said it would \u201cbless\u201d (meaning not marry) same-sex couples pleased no one. A group of mps led by Ben Bradshaw, a gay Anglican, is looking at ways to amend the legislation to allow willing priests and parishes to take part, which they argue could also help boost dwindling numbers in the aisles. \u201cEither be the established church or go off and be a sect,\u201d says Mr Bradshaw. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in Britain, sign up to Blighty, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.
