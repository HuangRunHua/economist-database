They were haunted by the ghosts of a previous summit in Bucharest in 2008, which had declared that Ukraine \u201cwill\u201d join NATO, without saying how or when. That provoked Russia without securing Ukraine, consigning it instead into a dangerous grey zone. \u201cWe understand that we cannot be a member of NATO during the war,\u201d acknowledged Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, last month, \u201cbut we need to be sure that after the war we will be.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Vilnius, leaders did indeed affirm that \u201cUkraine\u2019s future is in NATO\u201d and said that it would not need to jump through the hoops of a \u201cmembership action plan\u201d or MAP. But hoops there still will be. \u201cWe will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met,\u201d declared the members, in distinctly gnomic fashion. (Concerns about corruption in Ukraine loom large for some NATO countries.) The pledge was \u201cBucharest minus\u201d, suggested Samuel Charap of the RAND Corporation. At the summit, the mood among many eastern European experts and officials bordered on melancholy. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "They should not have been altogether surprised, and they ought to be more cheerful. Joe Biden, America\u2019s president, had warned days before the summit that he would not wave Ukraine through. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Ukraine is] ready for membership in NATO,\u201d he warned. \u201cThere\u2019s other qualifications that need to be met, including democratisation and some of those issues.\u201d Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden\u2019s national security adviser, speaking on July 12th, defended the outcome as a compromise among allies. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it means exactly to go further,\u201d he said. Ukraine had made \u201csubstantial steps along the reforms path\u201d, he acknowledged, \u201cbut there are more steps to take.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Zelensky, whose mid-summit tweet that the decision was \u201cabsurd\u201d was thought to have irritated American officials, later struck a more emollient note. \u201cThe results of the summit are good,\u201d he suggested, adding that \u201cclear signals that [NATO membership] will happen were heard confidently today.\u201d But there were also signs of friction among friends. America deserved \u201cgratitude\u201d from the world for its support for Ukraine, argued Mr Sullivan, clearly annoyed by accusations of insufficient resolve. \u201cPeople want to see gratitude,\u201d agreed Ben Wallace, Britain\u2019s defence secretary, recalling that he had driven 11 hours to Kyiv only to be handed a wishlist of arms: \u201cWe\u2019re not Amazon.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Others, though, offered a more sanguine assessment of Ukraine\u2019s situation. \u201cUkraine is now closer to NATO than ever before,\u201d insisted Jens Stoltenberg, the alliance\u2019s secretary-general, pointing to initiatives designed to make Ukraine\u2019s armed forces more interoperable with those of the alliance\u2014a process already well under way owing to the flow of NATO-standard weapons. Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister, said that the Vilnius summit would be a \u201cbridge\u201d to NATO\u2019s summit next year in Washington.

"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Zelensky did not leave empty-handed, by any means. On the sidelines of the NATO summit, the G7 countries\u2014America, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan\u2014issued a joint declaration setting out general principles on how each state would now offer \u201cenduring\u201d support for Ukraine. The document promised to work towards \u201cspecific, bilateral, long-term security commitments and arrangements\u201d that would build up Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, including with air defence, artillery, armoured vehicles and warplanes (a coalition of countries will begin training Ukrainian pilots on F-16 jets next month). The declaration added that Russian state assets abroad would remain \u201cimmobilised until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine\u201d, the strongest commitment to date to force Russia to pay for Ukrainian reconstruction."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The G7 members did not go so far as to offer Ukraine formal security guarantees along the lines of NATO\u2019s Article 5 mutual-defence clause, according to which an attack on one is an attack on all. But they said that if, after this war, Russia attacked Ukraine again, allies would \u201cimmediately consult with Ukraine\u201d and offer \u201cswift and sustained security assistance\u201d including \u201cmodern military equipment across land, sea and air domains\u201d. It is now up to individual allies to flesh out these pledges. \u201cYou could expect more British troops in Ukraine after this conflict than you did before,\u201d suggested Mr Wallace. The devil will be in the detail of these bilateral security promises, with America\u2019s naturally being the most important.

A flurry of last-minute diplomacy saw Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s president, withdraw his blocking of Sweden\u2019s bid for NATO membership on July 10th. Once Turkey\u2019s parliament completes ratification, Sweden\u2019s membership will complete Russia\u2019s encirclement in the Baltic Sea and make it easier to plan the defence of the Baltic states to the south."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The allies also approved their first comprehensive (as in 4,000 pages long) defence plans since the end of the cold war, giving detailed guidance to armed forces on how to prepare for the defence of the north, central and southern parts of NATO\u2019s borders, from the Arctic in the north to the Mediterranean in the south. And there were further boosts to the battle groups in the east, with Canada pledging to double the size of its deployment in Latvia with as many as 1,200 additional troops. Mr Putin invaded Ukraine to push NATO away from his borders. Instead, it has grown stronger and closer with every month. \u25a0"}], "id": 34}
