On February 22nd last year, as Ukraine repelled Russian assaults along the front line across eastern Ukraine, his unit was involved in fierce fighting. According to his family, Kamonin was badly injured. \u201cHe went out with his unit on the mission, he had no documents with him,\u201d they wrote on an online message board. Their son did not return from the battle; and like dozens more he simply disappeared. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cHe was wounded and left behind. His colleagues don\u2019t want to say anything, and command hides the truth,\u201d his family say. Mr Aleksandrovich\u2019s case is the tip of an iceberg. On People Search, a group set up on Vkontakte, a Russian social-media platform, new faces of the missing appear daily with pleas for help."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Thousands of Russian combatants are missing in Ukraine. Suddenly thrust into war by President Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s commanders were ill-prepared for the losses their forces would suffer. \u201cNo funeral teams were created in advance to search for and evacuate the bodies of the dead,\u201d said Sergei Krivenko of Memorial, a now-banned Russian human-rights group. As Russia\u2019s campaign descended into fiasco, many soldiers were hastily buried in unmarked graves or incinerated in grisly pits and mobile crematoriums. Hundreds more bodies were simply abandoned."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Russian defence ministry has not put out a number on its missing in action (MIA), but some experts say it could be as high as 25,000. Under Russian law, if the body of a missing soldier is not found, official recognition of his death can only take place, in court, two years after the end of hostilities; though, this period has recently been cut to six months. After that, relatives will be entitled to 12.5m roubles ($134,000) as compensation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s record of finding missing soldiers, alive or dead, is abysmal. During its two wars in Chechnya, official indifference and systemic army failures forced many families to find and identify their missing relatives themselves. Over 200 Soviet soldiers who fought in the Soviet-Afghan war are still missing, with veterans still trying to trace them. In Ukraine these chronic deficiencies remain entrenched, with secrecy and staff shortages hampering efforts to find soldiers through official channels."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cRelatives learn information about a serviceman through the commander of a unit in which the soldier serves,\u201d explains Mr Krivenko. \u201cIt works in peacetime but in war conditions less so.\u201d Russian units have struggled to contact the families of those missing, and have failed to create channels to report soldiers\u2019 statuses accurately. As a result, many combatants who have gone missing, whether presumed dead or alive, are not officially recognised as MIAs and have not appeared on any of the lists of injured, killed and missing. For Russia\u2019s defence ministry they do not exist. In such cases, relatives are not entitled to compensation, or the government\u2019s help in searching for them. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Secretive and abusive practices long ingrained in Russian military culture feed the crisis. The army often treats its personnel poorly, dead or alive. For some commanders, eager to conceal losses on the battlefield from superiors, it is easier to claim a soldier has \u201cdisappeared\u201d and to leave their status unresolved. It also means that compensation can be delayed or avoided entirely. \u201cFamilies have a right to compensation but the defence ministry might not be willing to pay out immediately. It comes down to a propaganda war,\u201d says Matthew Holliday of the International Commission on Missing Persons. \u201cAnnouncing large numbers of missing is not a positive message to share when you\u2019re trying to win a war.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Abandoned by the authorities, families are turning elsewhere for help. Several communities dedicated to finding Russia\u2019s MIAs have sprung up online, sharing photos, unit details and identifying features. Relatives are even going to battlefields and morgues themselves in the hope of finding their relatives, or turning directly to Ukrainian social media for help."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the opening days of the war, Ukraine\u2019s interior ministry set up a hotline and a Telegram channel called Look for Yours, which allowed families to find information about missing Russian soldiers. But as the war has intensified, attitudes towards the invaders have hardened. Ukrainians are also struggling to find and identify their own MIAs. \u201cWe have so many unclaimed Russian bodies, but there aren\u2019t enough fridges to store the number of dead,\u201d says Olha Reshetylova of Media Initiative for Human Rights, a Ukrainian human-rights group. \u201cThey are not the priority. We have our own dead to find.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Most Russian families will discover the fate of their missing loved ones, at best, only after the end of the war, and even then the process could drag on for many years after a ceasefire, when and if one ever comes. For some, thwarted by the army\u2019s bureaucratic labyrinth and existing in a hellish personal and legal limbo, the answer may never arrive. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with The War Room, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 38}
