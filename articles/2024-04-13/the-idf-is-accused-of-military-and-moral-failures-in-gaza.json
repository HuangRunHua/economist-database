Israel had the sympathy and broad support of much of the West when it sent its army to war with Hamas. Half a year later, much of Gaza lies in ruins. Over 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gazan health ministry. The uprooted civilian population faces famine. Israel has lost the battle for global public opinion. Even its closest allies, including America, are considering whether to limit arms shipments. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of the criticism centres on Israel\u2019s armed forces. Even after its devastating failure to prevent the massacres of October 7th, the idf has remained the most cherished institution in Israeli society. Holding fast to the vision of the idf as both effective and moral is essential to Israelis\u2019 image of themselves. But it is now accused of two catastrophic failures. First, that it has not achieved its military objectives in Gaza. Second, that it has acted immorally and broken the laws of war. The implications for both the idf and Israel are profound."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Israel\u2019s army is unusual. It is widely regarded as one of the world\u2019s most advanced in its use of technology. But the idf is also a people\u2019s army, relying on both conscripts and reservists who represent a wide cross-section of society. Many of the 300,000 reservists Israel called up live in settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regular army units have spent much of their time there policing the occupation. This has had an adverse influence on their attitude to Palestinians, say many officers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Any assessment of the idf\u2019s operational successes and failures in the war in Gaza must consider the uniqueness of the war zone. Gaza is a densely populated, largely urban enclave. Hamas has spent the past 17 years of its rule embedding its military infrastructure into the civilian landscape and building a vast network of tunnels."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Israel\u2019s army has, at best, only half-achieved the war objectives of its politicians: destroying Hamas\u2019s military capabilities; removing it from power in Gaza; and rescuing the hostages. The idf claims to have killed about 12,000 militants. With the thousands it has wounded or captured, that represents around half of the pre-war estimate of 40,000. Hamas\u2019s military capabilities have been dramatically curbed. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the group is far from destroyed. Of the three men believed to have planned the attacks of October 7th, just one, Marwan Issa, Hamas\u2019s military chief of staff, is thought to have been killed. Many other field commanders have been killed, but Hamas\u2019s fighters are still ambushing Israeli forces throughout Gaza and the group is reasserting itself in areas the idf has left."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Military pressure on Hamas helped yield a short truce in November in which 105 hostages were released. That aside, Israel has rescued only three live hostages."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The idf\u2019s first failure has been one of strategy. On that, blame lies primarily with Israel\u2019s politicians, and the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, in particular, who have refused to countenance any alternative Palestinian force taking control of Gaza. But responsibility also rests with the generals and their understanding of how success there should be measured."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Hard and fast"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Criticism of the decision to start the war with a massive assault on Gaza City is growing. After October 7th, the idf\u2019s senior commanders were \u201cmotivated by deep feelings of guilt and humiliation\u201d, says Reuven Gal, a fellow at the Samuel Neaman Institute, a policy research centre in Israel, and retired colonel. He was a young infantry officer in the Six Day War and went on to become the army\u2019s chief psychologist. \u201cInstead of stopping this time to think and plan, [the army] went in fast and hard, to restore lost pride.\u201d "}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240413_MAC266.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 739.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "Major-General Noam Tibon is a retired corps commander who on October 7th rushed to his son\u2019s kibbutz near Gaza, single-handedly extricating his young family while Hamas was on the rampage.

(The idf disputes the Hamas-run health ministry\u2019s death toll, saying that many of the dead are militants, but the number of civilians killed is undoubtedly extremely high.) This is down to two main factors: first, operational directives that allow strikes even when the likelihood of killing civilians is significant; and second, a lack of discipline within the idf in adhering even to those rules. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Start with the laxer rules regarding targets. The idf has a dedicated war-room that tracks population levels in every area of Gaza and issues warnings, via leaflet drops, social media, phone calls and text messages to civilians, to move out of harm\u2019s way. But no part of Gaza has ever been totally cleared of civilians. An area on the population map constantly updated by the operations room is considered \u201cgreen\u201d once less than 25% of the original population remains.

But in the past these were authorised by senior officers high up the command chain. By contrast, at some points during this war there were over 20 different headquarters with officers of varying experience calling in attacks. \u201cWe never had an opportunity to call in such a range of air-power, anything from drones to f-35 fighters-jets,\u201d said one reserve officer in charge of a brigade-attack cell.

Soldiers have filmed themselves vandalising Palestinian property and, in some cases, put those videos online. On February 20th the idf\u2019s chief of staff published a public letter to all soldiers warning them to use force only where necessary, \u201cto distinguish between a terrorist and who is not, not to take anything which isn\u2019t ours\u2014a souvenir or weaponry\u2014and not to film vengeance videos.\u201d Four months into the war, this was too little, too late. \u201cHe should have acted much sooner to root this out,\u201d says one battalion commander.

Yet more troops and tanks will not prevent the idf from repeating the mistakes it has made in Gaza.
