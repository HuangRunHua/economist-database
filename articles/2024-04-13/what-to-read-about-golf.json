P.G. Wodehouse wrote whimsically about his favourite game. John Betjeman, who was buried near the tenth green of a rugged Cornish golf course, wrote a delightful poem, \u201cSeaside Golf\u201d, about scoring a birdie on one of its toughest par fours. Perhaps John Updike best described the novelist\u2019s attraction to this most frustrating of sports. \u201cIt is of all games the most mysterious, the least earthbound, the one wherein the wall between us and the supernatural is rubbed thinnest.\u201d Its detractors may say that a round of golf is a \u201cgood walk spoiled\u201d (the title of a fine book by John Feinstein).

In 1930 he won the British and American Opens and the British and American amateur titles, an achievement that has never been repeated. The basis of Jones\u2019s brilliance was his \u201cpicture swing\u201d, which no one had taught him. His putting, with a rusty, goosenecked club he called Calamity Jane, was fearless."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Jones retired in 1931, aged just 28, and went on to co-design and co-found the Masters at Augusta. He published this autobiography three decades later. It is part instruction manual, part analysis of famous golf courses and part memories of his greatest rounds. He practised infrequently because, as he writes, \u201cYou learn very soon, in tournament golf, that your most formidable adversary is yourself. You win or lose according to your own ability to withstand pressure.\u201d Jones soaked up that pressure better than any other golfer in history."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Golf Courses of the British Isles.

Konecky &amp; Konecky; \u00a39.99"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If Bobby Jones was the most stylish golfer, the grandson of evolution\u2019s greatest theorist was its most elegant chronicler. Bernard Darwin\u2019s foreword to Jones\u2019s book is one of countless pieces that he wrote about golf (he covered the sport for the Times from 1907 to 1953). As with many of the finest sportswriters, Darwin had expertise that extended beyond the game; he was an authority on Charles Dickens. Darwin was no mean golfer himself. He was a Cambridge Blue and played in the Walker Cup, a tournament that pits amateur golfers from the British Isles against Americans. It all helped to inform his erudite writing on the game. This book is imbued with Darwin\u2019s charm and humour. It has vivid descriptions of courses like St Andrews (\u201cthe home of golf\u201d), Sunningdale, Rye and Hoylake, accompanied by excellent illustrations of famous holes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Tiger Woods.

None has probed as deeply as this one. There is something almost Shakespearean about the rise and fall of Mr Woods, perhaps the most famous athlete on the planet for two decades, whose psychological flaws ultimately brought him crashing down. Driven by ambitious parents, Tiger was hitting golf balls on national television with a perfect swing at the age of two. Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian recount in gripping fashion Mr Woods\u2019s increasingly reckless behaviour off the course\u2014the philandering and car crashes\u2014at the height of his fame. Yet the most thrilling passages are those that transport readers to the scene of Mr Woods\u2019s many triumphs on the course, describing his supreme mental toughness and his technical brilliance."}, {"role": "body", "text": "GOLF DREAMS.

Updike was a reasonable golfer (handicap 18). In 30 lyrical and often humorous essays he portrays the highs and lows associated with this standard of play. The duck hook, the banana slice, the topped dribble, the ricochet off the tree, the fat hit, the stubbed putt\u2014never have the failings of the average golfer been so vividly described. But the moments of utter satisfaction, when result matches intention, are vividly recorded, too. Who but Updike would weave Herodotus, Artemis, Florence Nightingale, George Eliot, Dante and his own fictional creation Rabbit Angstrom into a book about golf? Battles with his swing, tussles with his instructor, musings about the etiquette of the game and his pleasure in the camaraderie of a fourball are interspersed with fictional excerpts and philosophical ramblings."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Greatest Game Ever Played: Vardon, Ouimet and the Birth of Modern Golf. By Mark Frost. Disney Publishing Group; 496 pages; $13.99. Little, Brown; \u00a312.99"}, {"role": "body", "text": "New York-born Mark Frost is a man with many strings to his bow: novelist, screenwriter, film and television producer and director. He was the co-creator of the quirky television series \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d. But he is also a fine golf writer. All three of his non-fiction golf books are outstanding. \u201cThe Match\u201d is an enthralling story about a bet by two American millionaires in 1956, which led to a match that pitted two young amateur stars, Harvie Ward and Ken Venturi, against the greatest pros of the time, Ben Hogan and Bryon Nelson. \u201cThe Grand Slam\u201d recounts Bobby Jones\u2019s capture of the \u201cimpregnable quadrilateral\u201d. But \u201cThe Greatest Game\u201d edges out those two. It tells the story of the US Open at Brookline Country Club in 1913, an epic battle between Harry Vardon, a 43-year-old Briton who by then had won six majors, and 20-year-old Bostonian Francis Ouimet, an amateur who lived across the street from the course. Both men had dragged themselves out of poverty and broken social barriers to play the game. Mr Frost employs the techniques of a novelist to build tension as Vardon and Ouimet, along with Briton Ted Ray, are forced into a playoff to decide the title. Their battle is one of the most rousing sports events in history, and Mr Frost narrates it magnificently."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Also try"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read about Saudi Arabia\u2019s splurge on golf and other sports.
