Between April 11th and 14th some 30,000 caffeine-keen people will descend on the area for the London Coffee Festival. Many visitors will be ordering flat whites. The drink has rapidly gained popularity among those who want to taste their beans rather than temper them.

Two shots of espresso are combined with between 140 and 180 millilitres of gently steamed milk and crowned with a sliver of \u201cmicrofoam\u201d. The result is punchy and, if done well, a little sweet: less milky than a latte and not as frothy as a cappuccino.

Tea was the preferred beverage for British settlers in the 18th century; as a result, no one seemed to know how to make a decent cup of joe. Beans were not roasted, but boiled. To improve the taste, people added chicory, a bitter endive, egg shells or mustard. In a letter to a newspaper in 1939, one man complained that Australia\u2019s coffee \u201cpunishes the drinker\u201d.

The Greek and Italian immigrants who arrived after the war brought expertise. Commercial espresso-makers reached the country in the 1950s. Peter Bancroft had tasted proper coffee on holiday in London and, with the help of his father, began importing Italian machines.

The firm opened 84 shops in 2000, but has closed many; it posted a profit in Australia for the first time last year.

However, along with avocado toast and Vegemite, flat whites are one of Australia\u2019s great culinary exports. In the past year one in three British consumers ordered the beverage; Pret A Manger alone sold 8m to thirsty Brits. (The company sold 9m cappuccinos, but says the gap between the pick-me-ups is shrinking.)
