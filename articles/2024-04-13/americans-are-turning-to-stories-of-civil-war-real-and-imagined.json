A full-scale civil war remains wildly improbable, given the strength of America\u2019s institutions and the professionalism of its armed forces. Yet according to a poll conducted by YouGov in 2022, 43% of Americans think such a war is \u201cat least somewhat likely\u201d to break out in the coming decade. Nearly 25% want their home state to secede from the Union.

Several novelists envisioned that a civil war would break out between northern and southern states.
