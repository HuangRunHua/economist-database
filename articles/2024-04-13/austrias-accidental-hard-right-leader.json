Lacking in charm, Mr Kickl was always meant to be the machinist rather than the captain. \u201cI think he is still sometimes surprised to be the leader of the fp\u00f6,\u201d says Robert Treichler, one of the two authors (the other is Gernot Bauer, also a journalist at Profil, an Austrian weekly). "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Nothing in his early years and even in his first decades as an apparatchik in the fp\u00f6 seemed to indicate that Mr Kickl would become a serious contender for Austria\u2019s chancellorship at elections this autumn. Born in 1968, he grew up in a working-class family in Carinthia. He was a good student. He liked the Beatles and the cargo pants he bought at the American army shop in Spittal. His grandfather Florian had been a Nazi, but that was the case for many of his generation in Carinthia. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "In spite of his academic abilities, Mr Kickl never finished his philosophy degree at Vienna University, nor his military service. Instead he joined the fp\u00f6 and fell under the spell of J\u00f6rg Haider, the party\u2019s charismatic leader from 1986 to 2000. Mr Haider spotted Mr Kickl\u2019s talent for marketing and communications\u2014and he was happy to let him do the dirty work of coining some of the fp\u00f6\u2019s nastiest yet unfortunately catchy phrases. Mr Kickl is said to have come up with a notoriously unpleasant comment by Mr Haider about Ariel Muzicant, then the head of the Jewish community in Vienna, for which Mr Haider faced the threat of legal action and had to apologise."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Mr Haider quit the fp\u00f6 to set up a new party in 2005, everyone expected Mr Kickl to follow him. Messrs Treichler and Brauer don\u2019t provide a satisfying explanation for why he did not, but Mr Kickl probably thought he would do better by staying with the fp\u00f6, soon to be led by Mr Strache, another gifted retail politician. But Mr Strache almost destroyed the fp\u00f6 with a scandal involving a video secretly filmed on the island of Ibiza in which he appeared to promise government contracts in exchange for party donations to a woman who claimed to be the niece of an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With the fp\u00f6\u2019s most talented politicians out of the way, the introverted Mr Kickl rose to the top. He moved the party further to the right during the covid pandemic, which he used to whip up protest against governmental restrictions. He praises the \u201cidentitarian\u201d movement, Europe\u2019s answer to America\u2019s alt-right; wants to stop immigration and even to deport foreigners. His hero is Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s autocratic leader. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "According to the polls the fp\u00f6 is currently Austria\u2019s strongest party, with around 29% of the votes. The leaders of the second- and third-strongest parties, the centre-right \u00d6VP and the centre-left SP\u00d6, vow they would never form a coalition government with the fp\u00f6, apparently scuppering Mr Kickl\u2019s hopes of becoming chancellor. But after what looks like a tough election for them, they might lose their jobs and their say in what happens next. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To stay on top of the biggest European stories, sign up to Caf\u00e9 Europa, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 39}
