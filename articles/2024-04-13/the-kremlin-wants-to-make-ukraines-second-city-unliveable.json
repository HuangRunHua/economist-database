Since then, the city has been on the receiving end of more ballistic missiles than at any time since the start of the war. Drone assaults have become more frequent: they fly faster and higher, and have a carbon wing-coating that makes shooting them down harder. But the March 27th attack on 23rd August Street was a pivotal moment, the first time a glide bomb, launched from a plane and capable of travelling tens of kilometres to devastating effect, had been used against Ukraine\u2019s second city."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The attack came just five days after a missile barrage destroyed almost all of Kharkiv\u2019s power-generation capacity. It has been followed by more than a week of operations using glide bombs, missiles and drones, killing at least 16 people and injuring another 50 or more. The escalation had military sources in Kyiv suggesting that Russia has resolved to make the city a \u201cgrey zone\u201d, uninhabitable for civilians.

Things were worse at the start of the war, he says, when all but 300,000 of the pre-war population of 2m fled. \u201cHow can you make a city like this a grey zone? People won\u2019t leave, because they have already left, then returned.\u201d Yes, powering up a city without power stations or working transformers was difficult, but they managed it. \u201cIf I told you how we did it, that too would be targeted.\u201d But many of the city\u2019s problems could be solved if the West provided capable air-defence systems or F-16s that could push back the fighter jets carrying the new bombs. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Russia\u2019s exact intentions are not clear at this stage, though there are signs that it is preparing for a major summer offensive. A Ukrainian source with knowledge of the intelligence picture said Russia is training six divisions (some 120,000 men) in eastern Siberia. On April 3rd President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia would mobilise a further 300,000 in June. Kharkiv is one of several possible directions for a future assault. It is not the most likely, but it has already been heavily trailed in Russian media. That might indicate a Kremlin information campaign to frighten Kharkiv residents. Or it could be a nod in the direction of a pro-war camp agitating for a fiercer response to Ukraine\u2019s frequent attacks on Belgorod, which are also causing unease in Western circles. In March Mr Putin talked about the creation of a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d on Ukraine\u2019s border.

The last time it tried, in 2022 when the city was much more poorly defended, it failed spectacularly. Taking the city would require breaking through Ukrainian defences and encircling it, which Russia is nowhere near being able to do; establishing air superiority, which is not a given; and winning a bloody urban campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong chance they would not succeed with any of that,\u201d says Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former defence minister. For others, the fear remains that the Russians will turn nastier when they realise they can\u2019t get what they want. \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to take Kharkiv, but destroy it\u2014perhaps,\u201d says Denys Yaroslavsky, a local businessman turned special-forces reconnaissance commander. \u201cWe\u2019d be talking about something of the order of Aleppo.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some have already taken the hint and packed their bags. Iryna Voichuk, a journalist, left for Europe at the end of March, after the glide bombs began to hit.

The energy shortage and military escalation are testing the resolve of the enterprises that are left. Among them, there has so far been no exodus or panic besides a few isolated cases, insists Yury Sapronov, one of the few big businessmen left in the city. \u201cI can\u2019t say that Kharkiv is suddenly going to benefit from a massive influx of investment, since we can\u2019t move the Russian border. But we will survive and small businesses can even prosper from internal demand.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "If others have written Kharkiv off, those inside the city have yet to receive the memo. Urban life continues in spite of the dozen daily air-raid warnings. Families walk in the city\u2019s central park despite the missiles that occasionally land nearby. Children play football next to a military facility. The sense of digging in is summed up by the city\u2019s decision to start building its schools underground. The first of these will open this month. It is entered via a single blast hatch that sticks out incongruously from a sports field. Built with reinforced concrete that goes several metres underground, it should survive anything Russia throws at it. All 900 spots in the first intake have been reserved.
