For her follow-up, she has traded the excesses of the urban elite for the struggles of unskilled workers farther afield. This may sound dreary, but \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d is a lively, humane book."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To write about the employees of a big-box store in upstate New York, Ms Waldman spent months working at one herself, earning $12.25 an hour unloading trucks of merchandise at 4am. Many of her colleagues had been working at the shop for years, but their hours were limited and unpredictable, which made it hard for them to make plans, get a second job or reliably cover their bills. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Town Square, the shop in \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d, is a rare source of jobs in a town that has seen better days. The fictional Potterstown still hasn\u2019t recovered from losing an office of IBM, a computer firm, to Mexico decades ago. The employees who show up to the \u201cdungeon-like\u201d warehouse in the small hours are not thrilled by their lives, but they are grateful to be there.

These affectionate portraits chronicle the rough luck of people who cannot afford university and who struggle to make ends meet or, in some cases, to stay out of prison. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet the book\u2019s light tone and brisk pace keep it from getting bogged down. The novel\u2019s drama comes from a scheme the workers concoct to get rid of their cartoonishly terrible manager by getting her promoted, which would also open up a rare managerial job at the store. Each character dreams of the life they might lead if only they had a salary and benefits."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The employees of Town Square enjoy their shared rituals and take pleasure in their \u201csense of mastery\u201d as they expertly stack boxes and arrange displays. Their pride is real but fragile, threatened by greedy employers, monopolistic e-tailers and the prospect of automation, which looms ominously near the end of the book. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter"}], "id": 72}
