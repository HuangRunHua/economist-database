Her skin was powdered. Her white organdie gown had been tailor-made by the House of Worth. Her gloves, as all debutantes\u2019 must, reached to the elbow. Her posture was from Miss Ironside\u2019s School for Girls in Kensington (\u201cShoulders back! Stand up straight! Speak clearly!\u201d). Rose Dugdale\u2014heiress, debutante, beauty\u2014was very well put together."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her bombs would be well put together too. Take the ones she dropped from the helicopter she helped hijack in Northern Ireland. They had a milk churn for the main casing. A core of gelignite. Fertiliser around that. Wire round the top to keep it all in. She worked with ingenuity and care\u2014and food would be a feature of her DIY destruction: she would later use packets of digestive biscuits to dampen the recoil on grenade launchers. That, the police thought, was clever. You had to understand physics to do that."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But then Rose was clever. And for a time\u2014after the ball gowns but before the bombs\u2014she had excelled. She\u2019d only agreed to that gown so that her parents would let her apply to Oxford. Soon, she was studying philosophy, politics and economics there. Later, she would specialise in philosophy and in Wittgensteinian \u201csimples\u201d: categories of objects that were one single, simple thing. Though little was simple about Rose: debutante-terrorist; heiress-thief; oxymoron incarnate. Her father would blame that education. \u201cNever\u201d, he warned, \u201csend your daughter to Oxford.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "He certainly had not meant to. Rose had been born into that English class for whom ignorance was less an accidental state than an ideal. At Miss Ironside\u2019s School for Girls, mistresses instructed the girls less in science than in sitting up straight: getting the right answer mattered far less than getting \u201cMr Right\u201d. At home, Rose was expected to dress for dinner, curtsy to guests and hunt both deer and a husband. And above all she had to do \u201cthe season\u201d, that \u201cupper-class version of a puberty rite\u201d as the writer Jessica Mitford called it, when four hundred girls in pearls curtsied before the queen. Or, as Princess Margaret put it, when \u201cevery tart in London\u201d did. Rose was repelled: it was no more than a pornographic marriage market."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Oxford, by contrast, had felt so modern. Her female tutor, Peter Ady, particularly so. Peter had breeches, Burmese ancestry, dark eyes, a boy\u2019s name (her mother had hoped for a son) and a habit of passionately kissing other women on the mouth. Students had watched, fascinated, as Peter stalked up to the philosopher Iris Murdoch and kissed her on the lips. A little later, as Sean O\u2019Driscoll records in his biography, Rose had kissed Peter too. Peter had responded and soon they were in bed. After, Rose lay on Peter and Peter stroked her hair. They weren\u2019t lesbians, Rose thought, or trying to be feminist fundamentalists or anything. They were just trying to be in love."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And for a time she was. With Peter, and with social change. Later, after Rose had been arrested\u2014first for burgling her father\u2019s house, then for stealing art from another one, and for that hijacking\u2014people would wonder why an Oxford-educated deb had turned to terrorism. It was the wrong question: she was not a rebel despite her advantages but because of them. Oxford had liberated her from her sex and class. There, she had stopped curtsying and started to wear men\u2019s shirts. She and a friend had even disguised themselves as men (wigs, glasses, grunting) to crash the all-male Oxford Union. Though her liberation was not total: when the BBC came to interview her about it, Rose meekly made them tea."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, the revolution was coming. And when Bloody Sunday happened in 1972, and 13 civilians were killed by British soldiers, Rose decided to hasten it along. She turned against Britain\u2014the \u201cfilthy enemy\u201d\u2014and became a militant. Whereupon her upper-class education suddenly came into its own. All that hunting and shooting was ideal rifle practice for a terrorist. Years of crawling on her belly stalking deer made her the perfect guerrilla fighter. Hadn\u2019t Mao said that political power grew from the barrel of a gun? Well, Rose knew how to wield one. And a stint in a French finishing school turned out to be splendidly handy for an art heist."}, {"role": "body", "text": "On April 26th, 1974, a little after 9.15pm, a car drove up to Russborough House in Ireland. Inside the house were Sir Alfred and Lady Beit and an expensive art collection. Inside the car were three masked men, two AK-47 rifles and Rose, pretending to be a French tourist whose \u201cvoiture\u201d had broken down. Within minutes Sir Alfred and Lady Beit had been tied up at gunpoint. Rose walked round the house, telling her men which paintings to steal (still speaking, as Mr O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s book notes, in that accent)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She wanted \u201cZis one\u201d (a Goya) \u201cand zis one\u201d (a Vel\u00e1zquez) and definitely \u201czis one\u201d (a Vermeer). The spell at finishing school and youthful trips to the Louvre had given her a discerning eye: \u201cNon! Not zat one!\u201d She didn\u2019t regret the heist: the pictures could be used to ransom IRA prisoners and the Beits were capitalist pigs; they deserved it. Besides, the Vermeer was just beautiful. History, she knew, would absolve her. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The legal system was less lenient: after she was caught, she was sentenced to nine years in prison. History would be less forgiving than expected too: Rose would be remembered largely for violence and for failure. That heist merely ended in arrest, while those carefully made milk-churn bombs failed to detonate properly: one bounced off a roof; another splashed harmlessly into a river. A British major said the army had begun assessing an interesting new weapon, the AGMIC: the \u201cAir-to-Ground Milk-Churn\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The AGMIC didn\u2019t catch on. The IRA eventually handed over its weapons. But Rose, who was let out of prison in 1980, was unrepentant. Towards the end of her long life she was asked what its best day had been. She thought for a moment and then answered: the day when she had dropped those bombs. That had been the happiest day of her life. \u25a0"}], "id": 77}
