It was to be formed according to a plan drawn up by Caricom, the 15-member Caribbean community, and other powers including the United States. On April 7th the nine-member council finally submitted a political agreement to Mr Henry for approval. His vestigial government\u2019s assent will let the violence-racked country move forward. As The Economist went to press, that had not yet happened. Only once it does, and a decree is published in Haiti\u2019s official gazette, Le Moniteur, can the council finally start work."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Haiti desperately needs some form of authority beyond the anarchic rule of the gangs. The country of 11.6m people has been chaotic since July 2021 when Jovenel Mo\u00efse, the then-president, was murdered in his residence. The situation reached a new low in early March, when gangs went on the rampage while Mr Henry was out of the country, blocking his return. The airport in Port-au-Prince has been too dangerous to use since then. No cargo moves through the main port, a terrible problem in a country which is a net importer of food. More than 40% of Haitians do not have enough to eat. Thousands are displaced. Getting in and out of Port-au-Prince, to Cap-Ha\u00eftien in the north, where Haiti\u2019s other international airport is still operating, requires a helicopter."}], "id": 34}
