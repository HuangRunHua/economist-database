But the popular uprising the coup provoked has attracted a new generation of fighters, who are making ground throughout the country. The junta has reportedly lost control of another part of its border with Thailand to armed rebels. The checkpoint at Myawaddy, an important land crossing, is thought to have fallen into the hands of Kayin (also known as Karen) militias. This is a setback for the regime as it is close to Yangon, the economic capital.

It was clear that these forces are now thinking beyond the battlefield, to what happens if, improbable as it may seem, they win.

The Kayah launched their latest campaign on November 11th. Since then they boast of having captured 65 Myanmar army posts.

Hundreds of civilians, mainly women and children, have been killed. Airstrikes and shelling by the armed forces have displaced more than 80% of Kayah\u2019s population.

It was the first state in Myanmar to establish an Interim Executive Council (IEC).
