Last month the justice ministry said it was bringing back the death penalty, ending a moratorium that had been in place since 2003, in order to \u201crid our country\u2019s army of traitors\u201d and to \u201cstem the resurgence of acts of terrorism and urban banditry\u201d."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Restoring capital punishment is, in part, a reaction to the desperate situation in eastern Congo, where the M23 rebel group has surrounded the city of Goma. The conflict with M23, which is backed by Rwanda, has forced more than a million people from their homes, most of whom now live in squalid conditions crammed around Goma. Congo\u2019s army is on the back foot. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d says Patrick Muyaya, a government spokesman, referring to the death penalty."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Human-rights activists and the Catholic church have protested, pointing out that the justice system is dysfunctional. Even Congo\u2019s president, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, describes the court system as \u201cill\u201d. Moreover, the government seems to use a rather expansive definition of treason and has recently been arresting critics of even the mildest sort. \u201cThe immediate effect [of the death penalty] is fear,\u201d says Fred Bauma, the director of Ebuteli, a Congolese think-tank. In February, secret-service agents arrested Mr Bauma and, he says, assaulted him in detention."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other incidents have also had a chilling effect. Last year the bloodied body of Ch\u00e9rubin Okende, a politician who was close to the opposition leader Mo\u00efse Katumbi, was found in his car in Kinshasa. Opposition parties said he had last been seen alive outside the Constitutional Court, when he had sent in his bodyguard to drop off some papers. When the guard returned both Okende and his car were gone. After a lengthy investigation, officials provoked derision by ruling that the death was a suicide. \u201cCh\u00e9rubin didn\u2019t get justice because the justice system is rotten,\u201d said Georges Oyema, a relative."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Congo\u2019s judiciary does not take criticism well and it is willing to pursue those who question the official ruling. One of Congo\u2019s best-known journalists, Stanis Bujakera, was sentenced to six months in prison on charges of spreading fake news about Okende\u2019s death. His employer, Jeune Afrique, had published an article without a byline that suggested that Congolese military-intelligence agents had killed Okende, based on a leaked intelligence memo. The government denied the memo\u2019s authenticity, saying it had been forged by Mr Bujakera. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pressure on government opponents had been on the rise before the general and presidential elections in December. But it has intensified since Mr Tshisekedi was proclaimed the winner. According to Mr Bauma, the think-tank director, the president is getting jittery about a loss of public support. The military successes in the east that he promised in his campaign have not materialised. A diplomatic solution to the conflict seems far off. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire to silence critics,\u201d says Mr Bauma. \u25a0"}], "id": 30}
