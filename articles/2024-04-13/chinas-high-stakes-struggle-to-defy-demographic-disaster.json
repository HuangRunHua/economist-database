This silver-haired state would be growing fast, too. China\u2019s over-60 population sits at 297m, or 21% of the total. By 2050 those figures are expected to reach 520m and 38%. Yet demographers describe China\u2019s future as greyer\u2014and smaller. While its older cohorts are growing, younger ones are not (see chart). China\u2019s total population declined for the second year in a row in 2023.
