"}, {"role": "body", "text": "That is one question considered in a new publication by Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, whose last book argued that humanity faced a one-in-six chance of being wiped out in the next 100 years, perhaps owing to the development of dangerous forms of artificial intelligence (AI). In Mr Bostrom\u2019s latest book, \u201cDeep Utopia\u201d, he considers a rather different outcome. What happens if AI goes extraordinarily well? Under one scenario Mr Bostrom contemplates, the technology progresses to the point at which it can do all economically valuable work at near-zero cost. Under a yet more radical scenario, even tasks that you might think would be reserved for humans, such as parenting, can be done better by AI. This may sound more dystopian than utopian, but Mr Bostrom argues otherwise."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Start with the first scenario, which Mr Bostrom labels a \u201cpost-scarcity\u201d utopia. In such a world, the need for work would be reduced. Almost a century ago John Maynard Keynes wrote an essay entitled \u201cEconomic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren\u201d, which predicted that 100 years into the future his wealthy descendants would need to work for only 15 hours a week. This has not quite come to pass, but working time has fallen greatly. In the rich world average weekly working hours have dropped from more than 60 in the late 19th century to fewer than 40 today. The typical American spends a third of their waking hours on leisure activities and sports. In the future, they may wish to spend their time on things beyond humanity\u2019s current conception. As Mr Bostrom writes, when aided by powerful tech, \u201cthe space of possible-for-us experiences extends far beyond those that are accessible to us with our present unoptimised brains.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet Mr Bostrom\u2019s label of a \u201cpost-scarcity\u201d utopia might be slightly misleading: the economic explosion caused by superintelligence would still be limited by physical resources, most notably land. Although space exploration may hugely increase the building space available, it will not make it infinite. There are also intermediate worlds where humans develop powerful new forms of intelligence, but do not become space-faring. In such worlds, wealth may be fantastic, but lots of it could be absorbed by housing\u2014much as is the case in rich countries today. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cPositional goods\u201d, which boost the status of their owners, are also still likely to exist and are, by their nature, scarce. Even if AIs surpass humans in art, intellect, music and sport, humans will probably continue to derive value from surpassing their fellow humans, for example by having tickets to the hottest events. In 1977 Fred Hirsch, an economist, argued in \u201cThe Social Limits to Growth\u201d that, as wealth increases, a greater fraction of human desire consists of positional goods. Time spent competing goes up, the price of such goods increases and so their share of GDP rises. This pattern may continue in an AI utopia."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mr Bostrom notes some types of competition are a failure of co-ordination: if everyone agrees to stop competing, they would have time for other, better things, which could further boost growth. Yet some types of competition, such as sport, have intrinsic value, and are worth preserving. (Humans may also have nothing better to do.) Interest in chess has grown since IBM\u2019s Deep Blue first defeated Garry Kasparov, then world champion, in 1997. An entire industry has emerged around e-sports, where computers can comfortably defeat humans. Their revenues are expected to grow at a 20% annual rate over the next decade, reaching nearly $11bn by 2032. Several groups in society today give us a sense of how future humans might spend their time. Aristocrats and bohemians enjoy the arts. Monastics live within themselves. Athletes spend their lives on sport. The retired dabble in all these pursuits."}, {"role": "second", "text": "Everyone\u2019s early retirement"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Won\u2019t tasks such as parenting remain the refuge of humans? Mr Bostrom is not so sure. He argues that beyond the post-scarcity world lies a \u201cpost-instrumental\u201d one, in which AIs would become superhuman at child care, too. Keynes himself wrote that \u201cthere is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy\u2026To judge from the behaviour and the achievements of the wealthy classes today in any quarter of the world, the outlook is very depressing!\u201d The Bible puts it more succinctly: \u201cidle hands are the devil\u2019s workshop.\u201d "}, {"role": "body", "text": "These dynamics suggest a \u201cparadox of progress\u201d. Although most humans want a better world, if tech becomes too advanced, they may lose purpose. Mr Bostrom argues that most people would still enjoy activities that have intrinsic value, such as eating tasty food. Utopians, believing life had become too easy, might decide to challenge themselves, perhaps by colonising a new planet to try to re-engineer civilisation from scratch. At some point, however, even such adventures might cease to feel worthwhile. It is an open question how long humans would be happy hopping between passions, as Peer does in \u201cPermutation City\u201d. Economists have long believed that humans have \u201cunlimited wants and desires\u201d, suggesting there are endless variations on things people would like to consume. With the arrival of an AI utopia, this would be put to the test. Quite a lot would ride on the result. \u25a0"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Read more from Free exchange, our column on economics:Daniel Kahneman was a master of teasing questions (Apr 4th)How India could become an Asian tiger (Mar 27th)Why \u201cFreakonomics\u201d failed to transform economics (Mar 21st)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter."}], "id": 64}
