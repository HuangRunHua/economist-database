Its inadequacies are obvious: three words could never capture the complexities of a group of more than 100 countries spread from Morocco to Malaysia and beyond. But the phrase has been adopted by Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron and Xi Jinping. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "The simplest working definition is that it refers to most, but not quite all, non-Western countries. Its use also denotes how emerging economies want more power over global affairs and often have a critical view of Western policy. Thus the global south is said to be outraged by the war in Gaza, and unhappy about Western decisions on Ukraine, covid-19 and climate policy. Sarang Shidore of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, an American think-tank, says \u201cthe global south exists not as a coherent, organised grouping so much as a geopolitical fact.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If the global south exists, sort of, then who leads it? Narendra Modi has suggested India could be its \u201cvoice\u201d. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (known as Lula), the president of Brazil, reckons his country could be, too. To examine this question we have worked with a group of scholars to crunch data on trade, financial and diplomatic links. Our conclusion is, counterintuitively, that America still has more influence than any other country over the global south, but that within the grouping itself China has become the most powerful member\u2014giving Mr Xi the strongest claim to leadership. The sting is that China\u2019s influence has glaring limits, and could even backfire. And other powers are on the rise."}, {"role": "body", "text": "We worked with the Pardee Centre for International Futures (PCIF) at the University of Denver. It has built an index of states\u2019 power from 1960 to 2022. The main metric is catchily known as \u201cformal bilateral influence capacity\u201d, a measure of how much power country A may have over country B, based on two dimensions. First, \u201cbandwidth\u201d, or the extent of connections back and forth: the volume of trade, diplomatic representation and so on. Second, \u201cdependence\u201d: how much country B needs country A\u2019s arms, loans, investments etc. More connections mean more chances for country A to exert influence\u2014and asymmetry in power makes it easier to do so. Think of China\u2019s power over Pakistan, for instance: ample connections and China enjoys asymmetric influence. The exercise examines power relations among the 130-odd members of the global south found in the G77, a UN grouping."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20240413_IRC213.png", "imageWidth": 608.0, "imageHeight": 701.0, "imageDescription": ""}, {"role": "body", "text": "America has been the country with the most influence over the G77 since the 1970s (see chart).

According to the index, China\u2019s \u201cinfluence capacity\u201d over the G77 is roughly double that of France, the third-most influential country, and around three times that of Britain, India or the UAE.

Last year Mr Xi and senior Chinese officials began referring to their country as part of the \u201cglobal south\u201d, a description they had hitherto resisted (the term is credited to an American left-wing academic in the 1960s), in favour of phrases like \u201cfamily of developing countries\u201d.

From 2000 to 2021 it funded more than 20,000 infrastructure projects, many of which were under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), across 165 countries with aid or credit worth $1.3trn. Some analysts have noted data showing that credit from large state-backed lenders such as the Export-Import Bank of China is drying up. But a paper published in November by AidData, a group from William &amp; Mary University, argues otherwise. \u201cContrary to conventional wisdom, Beijing is not in retreat,\u201d says Bradley Parks, one of the authors. The paper finds that there are many more entities extending credit to the developing world today: in 2021 it counted lending of $80bn a year. \u201c[China] remains the single largest source of international development finance in the world.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "China is targeting geopolitical fence-sitters.

China has also used its weight to curry favour on subjects such as its repression in Xinjiang.

It is the main trading partner of more than 120 countries. It has provided $240bn, mostly since 2016, in emergency financing of the sort the IMF specialises in.

Over the past five years it has overtaken Russia as the main source of weapons for sub-Saharan Africa. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though China\u2019s leadership position among the G77 is formidable, it faces problems. First, its influence is limited in reach and intensity. Recent polls in Africa and South-East Asia, for example, show split support for America and China in developing countries. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "China\u2019s conduct and political values may stunt its influence. Its actions in business and politics have attracted calls for accountability: countries sometimes lay the blame for their debt crises at its door. And the country\u2019s disdain for values-based interactions (it preaches non-interference instead) is apparent. Most of the one-party state\u2019s closest pals are also autocratic. Places in the global south where democratic values are considered strong, such as Brazil, are unlikely to have a close cultural connection with China. What is more, as China draws nearer to the likes of Iran and Russia it risks allying with countries that want to destroy, rather than to reform, the international order. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Meanwhile China\u2019s economic reputation could deteriorate. The public support it won through its lending binge happened before the money needed repaying. Some 75% of its BRI loans will require the principal to be paid back by 2030. It is probably no coincidence that the share of people in Africa who see China as having a positive impact on its development dipped from 59% to 49% from 2019 to 2022, according to Afrobarometer, a pollster. Mr Xi\u2019s latest response to economic woes in China is to launch massive industrial subsidies, which could lead to manufactured goods flooding markets of other emerging economies.

India\u2019s pitch to lead is also substantively different. Because it worries more about a China-led Asia than an American-led world, it is also pragmatic about its approach to reforming international rules.
